     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new role for the Notch signaling pathway in promoting cell-fate reprogramming in the C. elegans germline. Notch signaling is typically associated with maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors, but in this study, it was found to facilitate the reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells. This process requires chromatin perturbation, and the researchers used a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes to uncover the underlying mechanisms.

     The study found that Notch signaling activates specific genes that are silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 is a chromatin regulator that maintains gene silencing, and the researchers identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial target of Notch signaling that facilitates reprogramming. UTX-1 is a key regulator of gene expression, and its activation by Notch signaling allows for the reprogramming of germ cells into somatic cells.

     The researchers used tissue-specific expression profiling to identify genes activated by Notch signaling in the C. elegans germline. They found that many of these genes were also repressed by PRC2, suggesting an antagonistic relationship between Notch signaling and PRC2. The study also found that Notch-activated genes were disproportionately linked to the X chromosome, which is largely silenced by PRC2 in the C. elegans germline.

     The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling. Notch signaling plays a critical role in many developmental processes, and its dysregulation has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The discovery of its role in promoting cell-fate reprogramming in the C. elegans germline provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying these processes and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
Summary
     The study investigated the role of the adaptor protein SKAP2 in host defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) infection. K. pneumoniae is a pathogen that causes respiratory, blood, liver, and bladder infections. The researchers found that SKAP2 is essential for protection against K. pneumoniae pulmonary infections in mice. Mice lacking SKAP2 (Skap2-/-) had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice. SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells controlled the bacterial burden. Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs, but the neutrophils failed to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to K. pneumoniae infection in vitro. ROS production in response to K. pneumoniae required the activity of several proteins, including Src family kinases (SFKs), spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2), and protein kinase C (PKC). The loss of SKAP2 hindered the K. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2, indicating that SKAP2 is proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. The study suggests that SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is crucial for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and promoting bacterial clearance during infection. Additionally, the researchers found that K. pneumoniae is resistant to neutrophil phagocytosis regardless of SKAP2 expression, but can elicit SKAP2-independent degranulation during infection. ROS is an essential mechanism for protection against K. pneumoniae, as mice lacking the gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase (Cybb-/-) were more susceptible to K. pneumoniae infection. The study demonstrates that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils contribute to the pulmonary containment of K. pneumoniae in lungs independent of inflammatory monocytes. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of SKAP2 in host defense against K. pneumoniae infection.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand the role of the hypnozoite reservoir in the transmission of Plasmodium vivax malaria. The hypnozoite reservoir refers to the latent liver-stage parasites that can reactivate weeks to months after the initial infection, causing new blood-stage infections. This reservoir is distinct from the parasite reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito.

The model, which simulates the within-host dynamics of hypnozoites, predicts that the reservoir is over-dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites, while others have intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites are more likely to experience relapses and contribute to the transmission of P. vivax. The model also suggests that incorporating hypnozoite-killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens can significantly reduce P. vivax transmission by targeting individuals with the most hypnozoites.

The researchers validated their model against data from tropical strains of P. vivax and embedded it in a P. vivax transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnozoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypnozoite activation and death. The model provides valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector, blood, and liver.

The study highlights the importance of considering the hypnozoite reservoir in P. vivax transmission models. Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for this reservoir, but it has been incorporated into some P. vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection or as up to two broods of hypnozoites. The researchers' within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes demonstrates that many epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by assuming that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate.

Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P. vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir. In the absence of effective diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites, models will play a crucial role in estimating and predicting the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir, either indirectly via vector control and blood-stage anti-malarials or directly via primaquine treatment.

Summary
     Researchers have identified two distinct populations of neural stem cells in the adult mouse forebrain: neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) and quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs). NICs, referred to as GEPCOT cells, are highly mitotic, short-lived, and capable of forming neurospheres that undergo multilineage differentiation. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent, long-lived, and unable to form neurospheres but express stem cell markers such as Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2.

Using flow cytometry, GEPCOT cells were identified as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− cells, accounting for 3.2 ± 0.7% of all subventricular zone (SVZ) cells. On average, 36 ± 6% of GEPCOT cells formed neurospheres, and 74% of those neurospheres underwent multilineage differentiation. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed higher levels of Glast and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2.

Fate-mapping with Ascl1CreERT2 and Dlx1CreERT2 revealed that GEPCOT cells were highly mitotically active in vivo but persisted only transiently in the SVZ. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were long-lived in the SVZ. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted both pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, although pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent on Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a (p16Ink4a) repression.

These findings distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo. The identification of GEPCOT cells as NICs and pre-GEPCOT cells as quiescent NSCs provides new insights into the biology of neural stem cells in the adult mouse forebrain.
Biomedical researchers have investigated the properties of Piezo1 ion channels, which are responsible for sensing mechanical forces in various cell types and tissues. Using cryo-electron microscopy, the structure of Piezo1 was found to be bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature. This suggests that Piezo1 ion channels may interact functionally and influence each other's spatial distribution. To examine this further, the researchers used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to study Piezo1 ion channels in cells expressing the protein at low and high levels.

The study found that the density of Piezo1 ion channels had no effect on their pressure sensitivity or open probability, even at non-physiological densities that would cause significant overlap between channels. This suggests that Piezo1 channels inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers, meaning they can function independently of each other. The researchers propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane.

The study's findings are significant because they show that Piezo1 channels do not have a strong tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other's mechanical sensitivity. This property is ideal for cells to transduce mechanical forces with high spatial homogeneity. The researchers used stochastic simulations to support their findings, which showed that Piezo1 ion channels at densities likely to be physiologically relevant inherently function as independent mechanotransducers.

Cells are constantly exposed to mechanical forces, and the rapid sensing of these forces is achieved by force-gated ion channels that convert mechanical energy into electrochemical signals. Piezo1 is a mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension with high sensitivity. The study aimed to quantify the spatial distribution and potential functional interactions of Piezo1 ion channels across multiple orders of channel densities. The researchers used electrophysiology and large numbers of independent measurements to simultaneously quantify channel number and function, including single-channel current, open probability, and pressure sensitivity.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the properties of Piezo1 ion channels and their role in sensing mechanical forces in cells. The findings suggest that Piezo1 channels can function independently of each other, which is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane.
Biomedical researchers investigated the effect of evidence volatility on decision-making in a perceptual task. They used a novel sensory manipulation to mimic the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex, which was verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. The study aimed to test the predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model, which suggests that an increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and higher confidence.

The researchers applied the manipulation to a well-studied motion task and recorded from neurons in the visual cortex of the macaque to verify the effect of the manipulation. They found that increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence in both humans and monkeys, with minimal impairment in accuracy. The magnitude of the effects was consistent with predictions of the bounded evidence accumulation model.

The study demonstrated that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision, or volatility, increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it. The researchers used a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task to study the relationship between volatility and decision speed. Three human participants and one macaque completed a large number of trials, and the results showed that increasing the noise led to faster decisions and greater confidence, with minimal impairment in accuracy.

The study's findings support the bounded evidence accumulation model, which provides a framework for understanding the joint effect of volatility on choice, reaction time, and confidence. The results have implications for our understanding of decision-making processes in the brain and may have applications in fields such as neuroscience, psychology, and artificial intelligence. The study's use of a novel sensory manipulation and neuronal recordings from the visual cortex provides a unique insight into the neural mechanisms underlying decision-making.
summary
     The insulin-like signaling pathway in Caenorhabditis elegans maintains a relatively short lifespan by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of the FOXO transcription factors in mammalian cells. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin, a PP2B phosphatase, also limits the lifespan of C. elegans, but its mechanism of action was previously unknown. This study reveals that TAX-6•CNB-1, the C. elegans Calcineurin ortholog, and UNC-43, the C. elegans Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) ortholog, regulate lifespan through DAF-16. UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization, while TAX-6•CNB-1 dephosphorylates and inactivates DAF-16. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin. The study shows that UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 regulate C. elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes suggests that they would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control of DAF-16. However, the insulin signaling pathway appears to dominate in conditions where there is a conflict between IIS and CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling toward DAF-16. The study provides new insights into the regulation of lifespan in C. elegans and highlights the complex interplay between multiple signaling pathways, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling, germline signaling, mitochondrial signaling, and the signaling pathways induced by dietary restriction.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding how the nervous system organizes motor sequences, which are formed through the serial execution of different movements. To address this question, researchers studied how fruit flies groom their bodies with sequential movements. They found that the motor programs responsible for cleaning individual body parts are organized into a suppression hierarchy, where the motor program that occurs first suppresses those that occur later. This means that cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which in turn relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy.

Using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets, the researchers were able to drive distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. They discovered that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked cleaning motor programs for five body parts that progress in series. By controlling each cleaning motor program separately, the researchers demonstrated that they are organized into a suppression hierarchy.

The researchers also developed a computational model that shows how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs. This model suggests that the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence. The study provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences.

The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of how the nervous system organizes serial behavior. The researchers anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism. This knowledge may also shed light on the neural basis of other motor sequences, such as those involved in human actions.

The study used a combination of genetic and computational approaches to investigate the organizational principles underlying the neural control of serial action selection in an innate behavior common to most limbed animals, grooming. The results demonstrate that hierarchical suppression among many behaviors leads to the emergence of a sequence, providing new insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie motor behavior.
Summary
     Sgol2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the coordination of essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in oocytes. Meiosis I is a complex process that requires accurate chromosome segregation, which depends on the coordination of cohesion resolution, kinetochore-microtubule interactions, and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Sgol2 has been found to protect cohesin, turn off the SAC, promote the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitate the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers), and limit bivalent stretching.

     Sgol2's ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and its ability to silence the SAC is mediated by direct binding to the MCC protein Mad2. In contrast, Sgol2's effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and is mediated by the recruitment of the kinesin MCAK and the inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively. Sgol2's multiple interactions link many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation.

     Depletion of Sgol2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in the dynamics of kinetochore-microtubule attachments. Sgol2 silences the SAC by binding to Mad2 using a similar motif common to Mad2's other two partners, Cdc20 and Mad1. Sgol2 deficiency also delays bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, causes increased bivalent stretching, and increases Aurora B/C kinase activity at kinetochores.

     The study demonstrates that a single protein, Sgol2, regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and Aurora B/C kinases. Different point mutations in Sgol2 alter the regulation of some but not other processes, indicating that the pleiotropy observed in Sgol2-deficient oocytes is not due to secondary or tertiary pathology. Sgol2's ability to protect centromeric cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A, and its deficiency causes striking changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics. Overall, Sgol2 plays a critical role in coordinating essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in oocytes.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the persistence of experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity relies on the localization of RNA and protein synthesis. Local translation plays a crucial role in altering the structure and function of synapses during synapse formation and experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. A recent study investigated whether local stimulation triggers the directed trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses, in addition to promoting local translation.

     The study used imaging techniques to observe RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons. The results revealed that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. This suggests that spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation, rather than directing the delivery of mRNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses, maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues.

     The study also investigated the mechanisms that trigger local translation and found a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Netrin-1 is a protein that plays a crucial role in axon guidance and synaptic plasticity. The study found that netrin-1/DCC signaling is involved in local translation at synapses, and that the release of netrin-1 from either the sensory neuron (SN) or the motor neuron (MN) during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity triggers translation at sites of synaptic but not non-synaptic contacts.

     The results of the study suggest that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is primarily mediated at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. The study also found that mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the sensory neuron, but translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of local translation and RNA trafficking in neurons, and highlights the importance of netrin-1/DCC signaling in regulating gene expression at synapses. The findings have implications for our understanding of synaptic plasticity and the persistence of experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity.
Scientists have developed a new method to study how cells organize themselves into complex patterns and structures during development. This process, called morphogenesis, involves interactions between different cell types and is crucial for the formation of tissues and organs. However, current methods for studying morphogenesis lack control over the emergence of different cell types and the ability to selectively manipulate specific cell populations.

     Researchers used a technique called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). They created mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then induced mosaic knockdown (KD) of specific genes. This allowed them to study how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation.

     The study found that silencing the ROCK1 gene, which regulates cortical tension, or the CDH1 gene, which regulates cell-cell adhesion, resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies. This patterning occurred through cellular self-organization, and the cells retained their pluripotent phenotype. The researchers also observed a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with the observed self-organization.

     The study demonstrates a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations and control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells. This approach facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis, which is essential for understanding the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during development. The findings have implications for the study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation, and may ultimately contribute to the development of new treatments for developmental disorders.

     The researchers employed an inducible CRISPRi system in hiPSCs to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension. They created mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then induced mosaic KD of specific genes. This allowed them to study how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation.

     The study shows that mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 results in a "bottom-up" cell-driven pattern formation of hiPSC colonies while preserving pluripotency. This approach enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, which can facilitate a better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis. Ultimately, this study identifies a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations and control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells, and subsequently facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation.
The article proposes a normative theory, known as the resource-rational theory, to explain set size effects in human visual working memory (VWM). The theory posits that the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost to optimize task performance. A model constructed from this theory predicts set size effects and is supported by data from nine delayed-estimation experiments. The model accounts for the effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision, aligning with previous empirical findings. Notably, the theory suggests that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size, which is a novel prediction that has not been directly tested before.

The theory may apply beyond VWM tasks, potentially explaining set size effects in attention tasks as well. It provides a normative formalism to test the speculation that the selectivity of attention arises from balancing performance against the costs associated with spiking. The model has relatively few parameters and accounts for a non-monotonic relationship between set size and the total amount of resource invested in item encoding. This prediction can be tested using neuroimaging experiments.

The theory also makes predictions about the effects of incentive manipulations on encoding precision, as these manipulations affect the expected behavioral cost function. The model's predictions are based on the idea that the brain optimizes task performance by minimizing a weighted sum of costs, rather than being constrained by fixed limits. This perspective raises the possibility that cognitive "limitations" arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints.

The resource-rational theory provides a new framework for understanding set size effects in VWM and attention tasks. It offers a principled explanation for the dependence of VWM precision on set size and provides a testable prediction about the non-monotonic relationship between set size and the total amount of resource invested in item encoding. The theory has implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying VWM and attention, and its predictions can be tested using behavioral and neuroimaging experiments.
biomedical summary
     The Irish potato famine pathogen, Phytophthora infestans, secretes an effector protein called PexRD54 that interferes with the host plant's autophagy pathway. Autophagy is a cellular process that helps plants defend against infectious diseases by breaking down and recycling damaged or dysfunctional cellular components. PexRD54 binds to the autophagy protein ATG8CL, stimulating the formation of autophagosomes, which are membrane-bound structures that engulf and digest cellular material. This binding also depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 from ATG8CL complexes, which normally helps the plant defend against pathogens. By outcompeting Joka2, PexRD54 counteracts the plant's defense mechanisms and promotes disease susceptibility.

     The researchers found that PexRD54 has an ATG8 interacting motif, a specific sequence of amino acids that allows it to bind to ATG8CL with high affinity. This is different from another pathogen effector, RavZ, which inhibits autophagy. Instead, PexRD54 activates selective autophagy, which may help the pathogen eliminate defense-related compounds or reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling.

     RXLR effectors, like PexRD54, are a family of modular proteins secreted by plant pathogens that alter various host processes. These effectors are useful tools for studying key pathways involved in pathogen invasion. In this study, the researchers show that PexRD54 binds to ATG8CL and stimulates autophagosome formation, and also depletes Joka2 from ATG8CL complexes to promote disease susceptibility.

     The findings suggest that, in addition to disrupting autophagy, pathogens can also activate it for their own benefit. The researchers propose that PexRD54 competes with the host cargo receptor Joka2 and depletes it out of ATG8CL autophagosomes to promote disease susceptibility. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of defense-related autophagy and the selective nature of this process. It also highlights the complex interactions between plant pathogens and their hosts, and the ways in which pathogens can manipulate autophagy for their own advantage. Further research is needed to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of autophagy and subcellular trafficking during host infection, and to determine whether other plant pathogens also target autophagy in similar ways.
Researchers have developed a new in vitro model to study how human cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) respond to changes in their environment, particularly in the context of cardiac injury. Cardiac fibroblasts play a crucial role in tissue adaptation and inflammation during pathological conditions such as ischemia. However, the mechanisms underlying their responses to environmental changes are not yet fully understood.

The study used a multi-stimulus microdevice to apply combined mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension to human primary CFs. The researchers found that individual stimuli, such as mechanical strain or changes in oxygen tension, triggered different responses in CFs. For example, mechanical strain caused CFs to proliferate, while changes in oxygen tension led to an increase in collagen presence.

However, the combination of hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and simulated loss of contractility (2% strain) had a more significant impact on CFs. This combination triggered the release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which are associated with tissue remodeling and fibrosis.

The study's findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between environmental stimuli and CF responses. The researchers propose that their in vitro model can be used to better understand pathological mechanisms and develop reparative strategies for cardiac disease. The model recreates a pathological environment by combining oxygen changes and mechanical cues, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of CF responses during cardiac injury.

The study builds on previous research that has investigated the effects of individual environmental stimuli on CFs, such as mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines. However, this study is the first to examine the combined effects of mechanical strain and oxygen changes on human CFs.

The results of this study have implications for the development of in vitro models of cardiac disease and the understanding of pathological myocardial remodeling. The researchers suggest that their model can be used to tailor reparative strategies for cardiac fibrotic disease, which is a common complication of cardiac injury. Overall, the study provides new knowledge on the complex interactions between environmental stimuli and CF responses, and highlights the importance of considering the combined effects of multiple stimuli in the development of cardiac disease.

     The DOMINO complex, a chromatin regulator in Drosophila, has been found to consist of two distinct multi-subunit complexes, DOM-A and DOM-B, which are specified by alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation, but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V, the fly ortholog of H2A.Z, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. In contrast, the DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to the yeast NuA4 complex. This work provides an example of how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation, as seen in yeast and humans, where nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification.

     The DOM-A complex has a similar domain arrangement to the yeast NuA4 complex, suggesting that it may serve as the central subunit of a NuA4-type complex in Drosophila. However, the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A complex, a principle that may be conserved across metazoans. The DOM-B complex, on the other hand, incorporates H2A.V into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex.

     H2A.Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers, where it is thought to regulate transcription initiation and early elongation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H2A.Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex, a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with the INO80-type ATPase SWR1 at its core. In Drosophila, the DOM-B complex performs a similar function, incorporating H2A.V into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner.

     The functional differences between the two DOM isoforms were explored through RNAseq analysis, which showed that knock-down of either DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP60, or H2A.V affects transcription. The results suggest that the DOM-A and DOM-B complexes play distinct roles in transcriptional regulation, with DOM-A functioning as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex and DOM-B incorporating H2A.V into chromatin in an ATP-dependent manner. This work highlights the importance of alternative splicing in generating functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the formation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) requires a precise interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells. A key protein, β-catenin (Ctnnb1), plays a crucial role in the differentiation of motoneurons in muscle cells. However, the mechanism by which muscle cells communicate with motoneurons to facilitate NMJ formation is not fully understood. This study aimed to elucidate the function of Ctnnb1 in muscle cells and its role in presynaptic differentiation.

     The researchers used an in vivo transgenic approach to investigate the functions of Ctnnb1 in muscle cells. They found that a mutant form of Ctnnb1 lacking the transactivation domain (TAD) was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation. This suggests that the transcriptional regulation function of Ctnnb1 is essential for presynaptic differentiation. In contrast, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 was found to be dispensable.

     To identify a potential retrograde signal from muscle cells to motoneurons, the researchers screened for proteins that interact with Ctnnb1. They identified Slit2, a protein known to repel or collapse neuronal axons, as a potential candidate. Overexpression of Slit2 in muscle cells was found to diminish presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation in mice. Furthermore, Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants.

     These findings suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation. The researchers also showed that Ctnnb1 associates with Tcf/Lef cis-elements in the promoter region of the Slit2 gene, indicating that Ctnnb1 regulates Slit2 expression. Slit2 was found to be concentrated at the NMJ, and transgenic mice expressing Slit2 specifically in muscle cells were able to rescue presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation.

     Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanism of NMJ formation and the role of Ctnnb1 in presynaptic differentiation. The identification of Slit2 as a retrograde signal from muscle cells to motoneurons highlights the importance of cell-cell communication in the development of NMJs. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between muscle cells and motoneurons during NMJ formation.
Scientists have developed a new method to study how forces are transmitted between cells in epithelial tissues, which are groups of cells that form the lining of organs and glands. Epithelial tissues play a crucial role in various biological processes, including development, maintenance, and adaptation. The researchers used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to quantify the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution.

The study found that basal force fluctuations in cell clusters are coupled to the localization of E-cadherin, a protein that forms the backbone of adherens junctions in epithelial cells. At the level of individual cell-cell junctions, the researchers observed that local mechanical stresses correlated with the localization of E-cadherin molecules. Additionally, they found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction.

The study also revealed that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged, typically on the length scale of one cell diameter, due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell-matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility. This is in contrast to previous observations of longer-range force transmission required for tissue morphogenesis processes, such as collective cell migration.

The researchers used a novel method to quantify force exchange profiles along cell-cell interfaces in real-time, allowing them to study the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters. They applied this method to spontaneously-forming adherent epithelial cell clusters and found that cell-cell force exchange depended on the cell position within a cluster and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements.

The study provides insights into the mechanisms that control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues and highlights the importance of coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in force transmission through cells. The developed method can be used as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions, which is essential for understanding various biological processes, including tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation.
Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the structure and function of the huntingtin protein, which is associated with Huntington's disease. A polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein is the primary cause of this neurodegenerative disorder. To investigate the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion, researchers employed various biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry.

     The results indicate that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid structure. The amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions of the protein fold to create a central cavity. Notably, the polyglutamine expansion increases the α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. This suggests that the polyglutamine expansion may modulate the structure and function of huntingtin.

     To further explore this idea, researchers conducted systematic biophysical and biochemical analyses of highly purified human recombinant huntingtins with varied lengths of polyglutamine tracts. The results show that the impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin's basic structural features suggests that the protein may undergo dramatic conformational changes upon interaction with its binding partners.

     Single-particle electron microscopy of recombinant human huntingtins with polyglutamine tract lengths of 23- and 78-residues revealed that the protein's shape may enable a structural impact of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract. The biophysical analyses of an allelic series of native recombinant human huntingtins provide a satisfying solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract may modulate huntingtin structure and function.

     The researchers found that the α-helical properties of huntingtin increase with the length of the polyglutamine tract. This suggests that the polyglutamine expansion may confer a novel property on huntingtin, contributing to the development of Huntington's disease. The study's findings provide new insights into the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin and the effects of the polyglutamine expansion, shedding light on the molecular mechanisms underlying this devastating neurodegenerative disorder.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of ferritinophagy, the autophagic turnover of ferritin, in regulating intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy flux and the role of NCOA4, a selective cargo receptor for ferritin, in iron-dependent processes have remained poorly understood. Recent studies have shed light on the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and the regulation of NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy by intracellular iron levels.

     NCOA4 interacts directly with ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on FTH1. This interaction is essential for the delivery of ferritin to lysosomes via autophagosomes. Furthermore, NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Under high iron conditions, the HERC2 ubiquitin ligase recognizes NCOA4 and mediates its turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, reducing NCOA4 levels and promoting ferritin accumulation for iron capture.

     In contrast, under low iron conditions, NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy. The HERC2 ligase plays a crucial role in this process, using its CUL7-homology domain to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions and mediate its turnover. This iron-dependent regulation of NCOA4 is essential for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis.

     NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is also critical for erythropoiesis, the process of red blood cell production. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying ferritinophagy and the regulation of NCOA4 by intracellular iron levels, highlighting the importance of this process in maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and erythropoiesis.
The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its functional organization has remained poorly understood. A long-standing proposal suggests that the LPFC is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information to facilitate efficient and flexible cognition. However, previous research has provided limited support for this theory.

     Recent human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed a rostral-caudal gradient of abstraction in the LPFC, indicating that progressively rostral areas are involved in processing more abstract information. Dynamic causal modeling further revealed asymmetrical interactions between LPFC sub-regions, suggesting hierarchical processing. Contrary to prevailing assumptions, the relative strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned the mid-LPFC as the apex of the hierarchy.

     The study found that cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards the mid-LPFC, consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. Moreover, the strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability. These results collectively suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized, with the mid-LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior.

     The researchers confirmed that the rostral-caudal axis of the LPFC operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus domain-generality/specificity and temporal control over action. They also modeled interactions among LPFC sub-regions to examine whether and how cognitive control demands elicit asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing.

     The study found that both the hierarchical orientation of the mid-LPFC in fixed connectivity and the top-down influences from rostral LPFC to mid-LPFC during the engagement of cognitive control were positively related to higher-level cognitive ability. This suggests that the functional organization of the LPFC is intimately tied to cognitive capacity. Furthermore, more strongly asymmetrical hierarchical projections from mid-LPFC to other LPFC regions were related to better higher-level cognitive ability, indicating a beneficial cognitive effect of a hierarchical organization with mid-LPFC at the apex.

     The researchers examined interactions within the LPFC by varying demands on stimulus domain and cognitive control, which engaged most of the LPFC and provided a comprehensive account of its function. They found that progressively rostral areas processed progressively abstract levels of cognitive control, with demands on feature control, contextual control, and temporal control eliciting increasingly rostral activations. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that hierarchical asymmetries in connectivity were strongest in mid-LPFC, and cognitive demands elicited both top-down influences from rostral to mid-LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid-LPFC. Thus, analyses of effective connectivity and its modulations suggest that mid-LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action.
Summary
     The study investigated the role of the hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 in brain development and cortical folding. TBC1D3 is a gene that underwent segmental duplications during the evolution of hominoids, but its function in brain development was unknown. The researchers found that expressing TBC1D3 in the ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused the delamination of ventricular radial glia cells and promoted the generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with the morphology of outer radial glia. Outer radial glia are a type of neural progenitor cell that is abundant in primates and is thought to contribute to cortical expansion and folding.

     The study also found that down-regulating TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased the generation of outer radial glia. Furthermore, localized proliferation of outer radial glia resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. This suggests that TBC1D3 plays a role in regulating cortical expansion and folding.

     The researchers propose that TBC1D3 acts as a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding. They also suggest that TBC1D3 may have appeared earlier than another human-specific gene, ARHGAP11B, which has been shown to promote production of basal intermediate progenitors and cause cortical folding in the electroporated mouse brain.

     The study provides evidence that the brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during hominoid evolution. The researchers found that TBC1D3 expression in neuroprogenitors by in utero electroporation at E13.5 caused a reduced expression of Trnp1, a gene involved in stemness signaling pathways, in flow cytometry-sorted cells at E15. This suggests that TBC1D3 may influence the intrinsic stemness signaling pathways in basal progenitors.

     Overall, the study identifies TBC1D3 as a hominoid gene that promotes the generation of outer radial glia and induces cortical folding in mice. The findings provide new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical expansion and folding, and suggest that TBC1D3 may play a key role in the evolution of higher intelligence.
summary
     The article investigates the role of ubiquitination in the transcriptional activity of the plant immune coactivator NPR1. NPR1 is a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance in plants, and its activation is associated with a reprogrammed transcriptome. Previous studies suggested that immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of NPR1 facilitate the continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters, maximizing gene expression. However, this process is thought to be costly due to the sacrificial turnover of NPR1.

     The study reveals that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event, where initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL3) promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes. This is followed by the extension of ubiquitin chains by the E4 ligase UBE4, which targets NPR1 for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, the activities of UBE4 are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity.

     The study demonstrates that initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity, while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome. The findings indicate that initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity, enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term.

     The study also explores the role of E4 ligases in the ubiquitination of NPR1. Unlike E3 ligases, E4 ligases do not contribute to the initial ubiquitination of substrates but rather extend pre-existing ubiquitin chains. The E4 ligase UBE4/MUSE3 has been implicated in the degradation of NLR immune receptors in Arabidopsis. The study suggests that prior to degradation, ubiquitination itself might act as a transcriptional signal, providing a window of opportunity for NPR1 to activate its target genes.

     The study concludes that ubiquitin chain extension and trimming activities can fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover. The findings provide new insights into the complex regulation of NPR1 and its role in plant immune responses.
Scientists have identified the precursors of 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 nt siRNAs) that guide DNA methylation and gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana. These 24 nt siRNAs are crucial for silencing transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2), and DICER-like 3 (DCL3). However, the precursors of these siRNAs were previously undefined.

     Researchers found that Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs) accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides long and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2's terminal transferase activity may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3' termini.

     The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5' or 3' ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model where siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events. This model is supported by the observation that dozens of P4R2 RNAs can overlap at a given locus, but individual P4R2 RNAs represent individual Pol IV-RDR2 transcription units.

     The study also found that P4R2 RNAs are dependent on both Pol IV and RDR2, as they accumulate in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants but not in nrpd1 (Pol IV) or rdr2 mutants. Furthermore, P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dcl2/3/4 triple mutants are substrates for DCL3, as they are diced into 24 nt RNAs in vitro. These findings provide new insights into the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and their role in guiding DNA methylation and gene silencing in Arabidopsis.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how immature neural networks develop into their mature form, enabling complex computations underlying cognition. A recent study investigated the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development in immature mice using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology. The findings reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs.

The study demonstrates that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics is marked by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week. Following this timepoint, precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerge. This developmental trajectory is also observed in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation.

The researchers hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. During this period, oscillations and neural spiking display a nadir, signaling the shift from local, loosely correlated, putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity. Cortical microcircuits are still undergoing dramatic changes in anatomical connectivity and functional connectivity between and within cortical layers during this developmental epoch.

The study shows that neural spiking becomes more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent, strong phase-locking, and higher temporal precision. These features are characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing. The findings suggest that a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations. Overall, the study provides new insights into the developmental trajectory of neural networks and highlights the importance of a transient quiescent period in the emergence of mature cortical dynamics.
Summary
     The coexistence of multiple strains in pathogen populations that undergo sexual recombination is a central question in epidemiology, with significant implications for disease control. A new agent-based model has been developed to address this issue, focusing on the var gene family of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria. The model considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression.

     The model tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes. The degree of antigenic overlap between these repertoires depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune selection in structuring parasite diversity.

     The var gene family encodes P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), the major surface antigen of the parasite's blood stages that binds to host endothelial cell receptors to allow the parasite to sequester within various host tissues. The model suggests that immune selection acting on multi-copy antigen genes can lead to the maintenance of discrete, non-overlapping antigenic repertoires, even when antigenic variability is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination.

     The model extends earlier strain theory by considering the effects of immune selection in populations of pathogens whose antigen-encoding loci are multi-copy and recombining. It explores whether structured parasite populations resulting from the selection pressures exerted by competition among distinct var repertoires for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity, can emerge. The results have implications for malaria research and control, as they suggest that vector control strategies that reduce transmission may not always drastically reduce var gene diversity, as a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse, highly non-overlapping var repertoires will remain.
summary
     The article describes how the deamidase OspI from the enteric bacteria Shigella flexneri disrupts the interaction between the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. OspI specifically targets a glutamine residue in UBC13, converting it to glutamate (Q100E), which silences the polyubiquitination activity of the UBC13/TRAF6 complex and inhibits the downstream NF-κB inflammatory response. The precise role of deamidation in silencing the UBC13/TRAF6 complex was unknown, but the study reveals that deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain (TRAF6RING) by perturbing both native and transient interactions.

     Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6RING interface. This competition prevents transient interactions necessary to form a typical UBC13/RING complex. Additionally, repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged surface of RING prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex. The study highlights a mechanism wherein a post-translational modification, deamidation, perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.

     Further studies showed that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6RING by three mechanisms: i) a new intramolecular R14/E100 salt-bridge appears in dUBC13, which competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge in the native complex, ii) the salt-bridge competition also perturbs the UBC13/TRAF6RING transient complexes to inhibit association, and iii) transient repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged interface of TRAF6RING reduces protein-protein association.

     The Shigella flexneri effector OspI suppresses the inflammatory response (NF-κB pathway) via deamidation of UBC13 at Q100. By an unknown mechanism, deamidation of Q100 to E100 inhibits the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, preventing the downstream activation of NF-κB pathway. These chains serve as a scaffold to bring together TAK1/2 and IKK kinases, eventually leading to phosphorylation and activation of the IKK kinases, IκB degradation, and nuclear translocation of transcription factor Nf-κB.

Researchers investigated the role of large-scale brain synchronization in working memory (WM) performance using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network. The study aimed to provide causal evidence for the contribution of oscillatory synchronization to WM and to examine the underlying neural mechanisms by which frontoparietal phase synchronization influences verbal WM.

The study consisted of two experiments using tACS to selectively entrain endogenous brain rhythms. The researchers tested four hypotheses: (1) behavioral WM performance is enhanced by entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands; (2) regional brain activity in this frontoparietal network is modulated in a phase-dependent manner; (3) changes in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) activity induced by phase-dependent network stimulation correlate with behavioral performance; and (4) functional connectivity across distant brain regions is modulated in a phase-dependent manner.

The results showed that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicated that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network.

The study found that synchronous (in-phase) stimulation caused an improvement in performance and led to increased frontoparietal activity when cognitive demands were high. These results demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization. The study also showed that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks, and those modulations are detectable using fMRI.

Overall, the findings provide direct evidence for the role of phase synchronization in cognitive demanding WM processes and reveal the neural correlates associated with this process. The results suggest that large-scale brain synchronization plays a critical role in WM performance and that external manipulations of this synchronization can be used to enhance WM performance. The study's findings have implications for the development of novel treatments for WM-related cognitive impairments, such as those seen in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Alzheimer's disease.

     Biomedical research has long understood that embryonic polarity in invertebrates, amphibians, and fish is largely specified by maternal determinants early in development. In contrast, amniote embryos, which include mammals and birds, remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. The study aimed to investigate how polarity is determined in amniote embryos.

     A molecular screen was conducted to identify upstream regulators of cVg1, a transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation in chick embryos. The screen uncovered the transcription factor Pitx2 as a candidate regulator of cVg1. The study found that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation and directly regulates cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes.

     Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1, and Nodal are also key actors in left-right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution. In most invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates, embryonic polarity is first established by the localization of maternal determinants in the cytoplasm and/or cortex of the fertilized egg.

     However, the ability of higher vertebrate embryos to retain a regulative model of development until a late stage suggests that localisation of maternally inherited determinants is not an essential component of the mechanisms specifying embryo polarity. The study implicates Pitx2 as the earliest gene described to date that regulates the position of the embryonic axis as well as embryonic regulation and twinning.

     Pitx2 is a transcription factor that is expressed in the same domain as cVg1 in whole embryos and in bisected embryo marginal zone, and it is expressed before cVg1. The study provides evidence that Pitx2 is a direct and essential regulator of cVg1 expression both during normal development and in embryonic regulation (induced twinning). The findings suggest that Pitx2 plays a crucial role in determining embryonic polarity in amniote embryos.

     Biomedical research has shown that fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors in response to odor gradients. To investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variations of olfactory stimuli, researchers subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined the spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). The study found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, with the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. This suggests that PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations.

The researchers tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations and constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information. The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input. This encoding mechanism is crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes.

The study demonstrated that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase. Recent studies have investigated how dynamic olfactory stimuli are processed in insect early olfactory systems and observed significant temporal processing of odor signals. Together, the researchers hypothesize that acceleration encoding in the Drosophila antennal lobe allows higher olfactory centers to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli. The findings of this study provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of dynamic olfactory information in insects.
summary
     In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, resulting in the formation of an embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group (PcG) protein family prior to fertilization. Research has shown that fertilization of the central cell leads to the production of auxin, a plant hormone, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing the PcG block. This process is essential for seed coat development, as mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, resulting in seed abortion.

     The production of auxin in the developing endosperm is thought to be the trigger for seed coat development. To investigate this hypothesis, researchers examined plants mutant for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62. The agl62 mutant seeds abort early after fertilization, correlating with early endosperm cellularization and failure to develop a seed coat. This suggests that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development.

     Further evidence supporting this hypothesis includes the rapid accumulation of auxin in the integuments after fertilization, impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causing defects in seed coat development, and ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiating seed coat development without fertilization. Additionally, the failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlates with failure to export auxin from the endosperm, indicating that AGL62 is involved in mediating both endosperm and seed coat developmental pathways.

     The researchers propose a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production, driving both endosperm and seed coat development. The fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin, which is exported to the integuments, lifting the PRC2 block on seed coat development and allowing for cell elongation and differentiation. However, this process is highly dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62, as agl62 seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm, leading to auxin accumulation and failure to develop a seed coat.
Summary
     The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein (RBP), which plays a crucial role in governing phage activity and host range. Despite its importance, the molecular rules of RBP function remain poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a high-throughput method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library Expression) to systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP.

     Using ORACLE, the researchers created a library of 1660 T7 phage variants by making all single amino acid substitutions at every site in the tip domain. They then quantified the functional role of each variant on multiple bacterial hosts, generating high-resolution functional maps that revealed regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns. The results showed that single amino acid substitutions alone can generate broad functional diversity, highlighting the evolutionary adaptability of the RBP.

     The study identified key functional regions determining activity and host range, many of which were previously unknown. The researchers also discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts. Furthermore, they engineered highly active T7 variants against a urinary tract pathogen, demonstrating the therapeutic utility of their approach.

     The ORACLE method presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems. The results of this study provide valuable insights into the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and highlight the potential of phage engineering for therapeutic applications. Further experiments will be required to assess the in vivo efficacy of the T7 variants, but the findings of this study demonstrate the potential of ORACLE to generate phage variants superior to wildtype phage that could serve as starting points for further engineering.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, have been found to rely less on pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration. To investigate the neural basis for this strategy, researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls. Participants were asked to read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary and then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues, selecting the best match for the written sentence.

The results showed that individuals with amusia exhibited reduced functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners. This reduction in connectivity was not present during a control task. The study suggests that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, and that individuals with amusia may have developed a compensatory mechanism to down-weight pitch due to its unreliability.

The findings are consistent with previous research showing that individuals with amusia rely less on pitch than controls to process spoken language (Jasmin et al., 2020a). The study also found that the extent of pitch-responsive regions within auditory cortex is similar in participants with amusia and controls (Norman-Haignere et al., 2016), and that brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is unimpaired in individuals with amusia (Liu et al., 2015b). The results suggest that amusics neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable, and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas that integrate information from perceptual regions. Overall, the study provides new insights into the neural basis of congenital amusia and highlights the importance of functional connectivity in speech perception.
summary
     Scientists have discovered a new contagious cancer in the Tasmanian devil, known as Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2). This cancer is distinct from an existing contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1), which affects the same species. Research has shown that DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, unlike DFT1 cells, which do not express these molecules. MHC class I molecules play a crucial role in the immune system, helping to distinguish between self and non-self cells.

     The MHC class I molecules expressed by DFT2 cells are either non-classical or shared with the host devils, making them less recognizable to the immune system. This reduced immunogenicity may contribute to the contagious nature of DFT2. In contrast, the existing contagious cancer, DFT1, has lost expression of MHC class I molecules, which may have facilitated its widespread transmission.

     The study found that DFT2 cells express both classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules in vitro and in vivo. However, the expression of these molecules varies among DFT2 tumours, suggesting that MHC class I-negative subclones may emerge as the cancer transmits more widely. The researchers propose that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumour and host, but the loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate the widespread transmission of DFT2.

     Further analysis is needed to understand the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumour evolution. The similarity of MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may reflect a shared geographical range and genotype pool, which could impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further. The heterogenic expression of MHC class I molecules in DFT2 biopsies suggests that MHC class I expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in DFT2.
Summary
     The study investigated the neural circuits in the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG), a region critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors. Using optogenetic circuit mapping in mice, researchers found a double dissociation between two types of principal pyramidal neurons in layer 1 of the RSG: low-rheobase (LR) and regular-spiking (RS) cells. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit LR cells, while claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information, preferentially control RS cells. This parallel processing is enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents in layer 1 of the RSG.

     The study found that LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, and the synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction, not speed. In contrast, RS cells are controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, which provide mostly non-spatial information. The distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum.

     The study highlights the importance of precise sublaminar organization in layer 1 of the RSG for parallel processing of spatial and non-spatial information. The integration of these parallel streams of information in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices is the next critical step toward a mechanistic understanding of retrosplenial computations. The findings have implications for understanding the neural basis of spatial orientation and navigation behaviors.
Summary
     Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for the development of dementias, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a type of tauopathy. However, the mechanisms underlying the spread of tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of tractable animal models. To investigate the role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy, researchers used a novel zebrafish model expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reports the accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections.

     The zebrafish larvae were subjected to a TBI paradigm that produced various TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. The researchers found that bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These findings suggest that seizure activity plays a role in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI.

     Zebrafish larvae have emerged as a powerful complement to rodent models of TBI and cellular models of tauopathy. The researchers engineered a novel in vivo Tau biosensor model in zebrafish that can visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant central nervous system (CNS). The data revealed a substantial burst of neural activity during TBI, and zebrafish larvae exposed to TBI exhibited a significantly higher propensity for spontaneous seizures.

     The researchers found that post-traumatic seizures correlate strongly with spreading tau pathology following TBI. Manipulating this seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation and revealed a critical role for endocytosis in the prion-like spread of Tau seeds in vivo following TBI. The results from the novel in vivo TBI model implicate seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds, offering potential therapeutic targets.

     The study highlights the importance of post-traumatic seizures as a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and the prion-like progression of tauopathy. The findings suggest that anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures may be a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy. Further work is warranted to explore this potential therapeutic approach.
Summary
     The relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions has been investigated in a recent study using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) data. Brain connectivity is often considered in terms of the communication between functionally distinct brain regions, with many studies examining the extent to which patterns of coupling strength between multiple neural populations relate to behavior. However, the exact spatial arrangement of cortical regions has been found to interact strongly with measures of brain connectivity, suggesting that cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions may be misinterpreted as changes in functional connectivity.

     The study aimed to identify how the spatial configuration and organisation of functional regions influence derived measures of functional connectivity and how they relate to trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals. The researchers found that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact with the modeling of brain connectivity, and that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle.

     The study highlights the importance of disambiguating the influence of spatial topography to enable the estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling strength between neural populations. The researchers suggest that the cross-subject information represented in commonly adopted "connectivity fingerprints" largely reflects spatial variability in the location of functional regions across individuals, rather than variability in coupling strength. This finding has significant implications for the interpretation of functional imaging data and cognitive traits.

     The study builds on previous research that has investigated the organisation of the human brain into large-scale functional networks using rfMRI. Spontaneous fluctuations in distinct brain regions show temporal correlations with each other, revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity. The researchers used partial canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to examine the relationship between network matrices and spatial topographical organisation of functional regions, and found that network matrices contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information that is not also reflected in the spatial topographical organisation of functional regions.

     The study's findings suggest that the functional organisation of the brain is conceptualised and operationally defined in a way that is directly relevant to the interpretation of these findings. The researchers conclude that a better understanding of these effects is important when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits, and that future studies should aim to disambiguate the influence of spatial topography to enable the estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling strength between neural populations.
summary
     Biomedical research has proposed that changes in the components of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) control cell type-specific gene expression. Specifically, it was suggested that the replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2 is required for the activation of muscle-gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. However, the role of TBP2 in adult myogenesis was unclear due to the lack of a developmental phenotype in TBP2 null mice.

     To investigate this further, researchers analyzed TBP2 null mice and found that they have an intact regeneration potential upon injury. Additionally, TBP2 was not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cells or primary mouse muscle stem cells (MuSCs). In contrast, TFIID subunits and TBP were downregulated during myoblast differentiation, but reduced amounts of these proteins formed a complex that was detectable on the promoters of muscle genes and was essential for their expression.

     The study demonstrated that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. TBP2 was not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts or primary mouse MuSCs. Furthermore, TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild-type MuSCs.

     The researchers also compared the RNA expression profile of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild-type mice by FACS and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line. Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes. The study suggests that the TFIID complex may be present in myogenic cells and may drive muscle gene transcription during myoblast differentiation into myotubes.

     Importantly, the researchers detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of wild-type and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury, indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew, and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2. These findings demonstrate that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation and that limiting amounts of TFIID-TBP are required to promote muscle-specific gene expression.
Researchers used optogenetics to study the effects of stimulation on large-scale networks in the brains of two macaques. They used a large-scale optogenetic interface to simultaneously stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocorticographic activity across the primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortex. The study aimed to investigate how stimulation affects network dynamics and functional connectivity between these areas. Two measures of network connectivity were tracked : the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes. These measures were strongly correlated before stimulation, indicating a robust relationship between them.

     Stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the gross functional connectivity between these areas within minutes. However, at a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network. These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. Hebbian plasticity suggests that "neurons that fire together, wire together", meaning that neurons that are activated together become more connected.

     The study found that stimulation-evoked correlations were strongly correlated with changes in baseline connectivity across the network. This relationship is well-explained by a Hebbian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity. The results demonstrate that stimulation can drive large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation. This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits, providing new insights into the mechanisms of brain reorganization following stimulation.

     The study used a large-scale optogenetic interface to simultaneously stimulate populations of excitatory neurons and record large-scale μ-electrocorticography ( μ-ECoG ) activity across S1 and M1. The researchers established and compared two measures of functional connectivity that provide complementary views of the mechanisms of plasticity. They found that both measures support a key role for Hebbian learning in sensorimotor cortical plasticity. However, a deeper understanding of the relationship between these bodies of work would require further study of intermediate time-frames and detailed cortical mapping. The large-scale interface used in this study enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations.
summary
     A rare case of a Rhesus macaque monkey, born without primary visual cortex (V1), was studied to understand the neural consequences of such damage. The monkey's in-group behavior was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anesthesia with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field moving dots activated the pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches.

     Functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, there was little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena. Visual structures, both cortical and subcortical, outside of the large lesion of primary visual cortex remained intact in the monkey, with little evidence of atrophy.

     The structural connectivity between the subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, but the microstructure was intact. A connectivity analysis was performed to understand the nature of the response in area V5/MT. Given the significantly weakened tract between V5/MT and subcortical nuclei, there is little evidence to suggest that a strengthening of these connections underlies whatever residual vision was present in the monkey.

     Residual vision can manifest in several different ways, including the ability to determine information from faces. For visual motion stimuli, foci of activation in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres were observed, suggesting any activation may be sub-threshold and difficult to detect with BOLD. Even without the strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses, it was possible to map out a functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT.

     Retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via the weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation, possibly due to the anesthesia, makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between the monkey and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests either or both could support residual visual abilities.
summary
     The innate immune system's ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the intracellular environment is a crucial defense mechanism against pathogenic infections. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the distinction between foreign DNA and host genomic material inside the nucleus are not well understood. A recent study has shed light on this process by investigating the role of the nuclear innate immune sensor IFI16. Using biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques, the researchers found that IFI16 scans along exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. This one-dimensional tracking mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish between self and non-self DNA.

     The study demonstrated that nucleosomes, which are the basic units of chromatin, act as barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with its one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism enables IFI16 to efficiently and selectively assemble into oligomers on foreign DNA. The researchers used time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays to visualize the movement of IFI16 along dsDNA and observed that chromatinization is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanism by which innate immune sensors distinguish self from foreign dsDNA in the host nucleus. The researchers propose that the one-dimensional diffusion-mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses. In vivo, this mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate each other on large genomes of invading pathogens. The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of the innate immune system's ability to recognize and respond to foreign DNA in the nucleus.
summary
     Scientists have developed a new technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics (STOMP) to analyze the composition of small protein deposits in tissues. This method uses a combination of two-photon laser scanning microscopy, photochemical affinity labeling, and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins present in specific regions of interest (ROIs) at a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. The technique does not require genetic manipulation and can be applied to various biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue.

To perform STOMP, specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize the ROIs, and then soaked in a solution containing a photo-tag, which is a peptide that forms covalent bonds with proteins upon excitation by laser light. The photo-tagged proteins are then isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. In a test case, STOMP was used to analyze amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones.

The results showed that the predominant protein photo-tagged in the STOMP sample was Aβ, which is not visible in the non-plaque experiment due to its low overall abundance. Gel electrophoresis of the indiscriminately photo-tagged proteins revealed a different pattern of protein bands compared to the specimen in which amyloid plaques were specifically targeted for STOMP analysis. The technique has the potential to provide clues to the etiology of neurodegenerative diseases and advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification.

STOMP represents the first application of two-photon microscopy to affinity photolabeling, offering single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution that is an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art. The technique has the potential to be applied to various biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue. The total volume of tissue that needs to be photo-tagged to obtain sufficient material for mass spectrometry analysis is a subjective matter and depends on instrument sensitivity, fixation method used, sample complexity, and other factors.
summary
     The Frizzled3 (Fz3) gene plays a crucial role in the development of axons in cranial and spinal motor neurons. Research has shown that disruption of the Fz3 gene leads to defects in axonal growth in specific motor nerves, including the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs. In Fz3-deficient limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus and do not reroute to alternative trajectories, unlike other axon path-finding mutants.

     Affected motor neurons undergo cell death two days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death, which coincides with the innervation of muscle targets. This finding provides in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. The study suggests that planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling is involved in motor axon growth and highlights the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell-cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth.

     In the limb, the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among lateral motor column (LMCL) axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal motor neurons die shortly after their axons stall, indicating that the primary cause of motor axon deficiency in Fz3-deficient mice is not defective motor neuron differentiation or excessive motor neuron death, but rather defective axon growth and/or guidance.

     The study found that the majority of Fz3-deficient motor axons do not follow erroneous trajectories, suggesting that aberrant path-finding is unlikely to be the primary cause of the motor axon deficiency. Instead, the research suggests that the precocious motor neuron death in Fz3-deficient embryos may be due to the lack of survival signals from intermediate targets along the axon's trajectory. This idea is supported by in vitro co-culture experiments with spinal cord commissural axons and floor plate tissue.

     The study also found that a discrete subset of motor neurons in Fz3-deficient embryos exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11.5-E12.5. This finding suggests that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons. The research has implications for our understanding of the role of PCP signaling in motor axon growth and the development of motor neurons.
biomedical researchers investigated the role of transposable elements (TEs) in gene regulation during early mouse development. TEs are repetitive DNA sequences that can jump from one location to another in the genome and are thought to have contributed to the establishment of gene regulatory networks. The study focused on two types of TEs, long terminal repeat (LTR) TE families, and their potential function as enhancers in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs).

The researchers used a combination of epigenomic and transcriptomic data to identify a large number of TEs that are involved in establishing tissue-specific gene expression programs in ESCs and TSCs. They then used genetic editing techniques, including CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and CRISPR-mediated genetic excision, to test the regulatory roles of individual TEs. The results showed that a subset of TEs play significant roles in gene regulation, while others have little or no effect.

The study found that a minority of RLTR13D6 elements, a type of LTR TE, are important for gene regulation in ESCs. In contrast, a wider survey of RLTR13D6 elements in ESCs using CRISPRi revealed that only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation. The researchers also identified a number of TEs that are important for driving expression of lineage-specific genes in ESCs and TSCs.

The study highlights the importance of functional experiments in evaluating the gene regulatory roles of TEs. The results suggest that a subset of TEs are crucial for gene regulation in early mouse development, while others may play redundant or no role. The findings also emphasize the need for further research to understand the proportion of TE+ enhancers that act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex and multifaceted role of TEs in gene regulation during early development.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that has independently emerged in at least 60 plant lineages. C4 photosynthesis is a more efficient way for plants to convert sunlight into energy, allowing them to thrive in environments with limited water and nutrients. However, the exact path of its evolution has remained unclear.

     To better understand how C4 photosynthesis evolved, researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3-C4 forms of photosynthesis. They developed a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model to predict how the C4 phenotype evolved. This approach allowed them to infer the likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data.

     The results showed that the emergence of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. The researchers found that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. This means that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was influenced by factors other than photosynthesis itself, such as environmental pressures or genetic mutations.

     The study also revealed that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space. This suggests that the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was shaped by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The researchers propose that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis, which may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits.

     The findings of this study have important implications for efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through genetic engineering of C3 species. The researchers suggest that including additional early traits in the analysis did not alter the predicted order of the original 16 traits, indicating that their conclusions are robust. Overall, this study provides new insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and highlights the importance of considering non-photosynthetic drivers in the evolution of complex traits.
summary
     Scientists have reengineered the ATPase active site of a bacterial protein called SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during the sporulation process in Bacillus subtilis. The protein evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the reason for the change in nucleotide specificity from GTP to ATP is unclear. The reengineered protein, SpoIVAGTPase, functioned properly as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP (nucleoside diphosphate)-bound intermediate required for polymerization. Further, incubation of SpoIVAGTPase with limiting ATP did not promote efficient polymerization. This suggests that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical in specific biological functions.

The study found that SpoIVAGTPase, which can use either ATP or GTP to induce a conformational change after nucleotide hydrolysis, only polymerized in the presence of ATP. This indicates a specific requirement for the nucleotide base, not just the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis, for its function. The researchers also observed that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase.

The study suggests that the switch in nucleotide specificity in SpoIVA from GTP to ATP may have been driven by increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation. This is consistent with the fact that SpoIVA is actively assembling the spore coat 5-5 hours after the initiation of sporulation. The researchers also found that both SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase failed to undergo nucleotide hydrolysis-mediated structural changes in the presence of low levels of GTP but did so in the presence of high levels of ATP. However, when examining SpoIVA polymerization at different concentrations of ATP, the researchers observed that neither SpoIVA nor SpoIVAGTPase were able to polymerize in the presence of low levels of ATP.
Summary
     The study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. Leptin is a hormone that regulates energy balance and has neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. Researchers restored leptin signaling in mice that were previously deficient in the leptin receptor gene at either the fourth or tenth week of age. The results showed that some previously irreversible defects caused by neonatal leptin deficiency, such as poor development of neural projections in the arcuate nucleus, were recovered by reactivating leptin signaling in adulthood. However, leptin receptor deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity due to suppressed energy expenditure. Additionally, reactivating leptin signaling in adulthood resulted in persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt, and Prlh mRNA expression, as well as defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. These findings suggest that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. The study highlights the importance of leptin signaling during development for long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin. The results also indicate that early postnatal leptin blockage can lead to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. The study contributes to the understanding of metabolic programming and the consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life, which is particularly relevant in the context of the growing problem of childhood obesity worldwide. Overall, the study provides new insights into the critical role of leptin signaling during development and its long-term effects on metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental processes.
summary
     Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2, play a crucial role in regulating immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2 receptor. The FLS2 receptor perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1. In the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. This interaction is essential for maintaining the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex.

    Following activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. This post-activation mechanism is critical for the regulation of immune responses. The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms.

    The introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 largely restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in xlg2 and agb1 mutants, indicating that the heterotrimeric G protein is essential for maintaining the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state. The results also show that the G proteins dynamically interact with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex during FLS2 signaling, and the findings are consistent with the observed defects in flg22-induced responses and RbohD phosphorylation in the G protein mutants.

    The study highlights the importance of heterotrimeric G proteins in plant immunity and provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying FLS2-mediated immune responses. The findings suggest that plant receptor kinases can directly couple to heterotrimeric G proteins, similar to G protein-coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) in animals. The study also demonstrates that the G proteins coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex are subject to multiple regulations during FLS2 signaling, underscoring the complexity of plant immune signaling pathways.
Scientists have studied the Arabidopsis circadian clock, a system that regulates gene expression across the day-night cycle, to understand how it functions at the single-cell level. Previous research has identified a multiple feedback loop circuit that generates the 24-hour rhythm, but it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells and how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. To address this, researchers examined clock activity in Arabidopsis seedlings at the single-cell level over several days under constant environmental conditions.

The study found that individual cells exhibit robust oscillations, but these oscillations are desynchronized. Two waves of clock activity were observed: one traveling down the root and the other up the root. The researchers also found evidence of cell-to-cell coupling, particularly in the root tip. A simple model suggested that the combination of cell-to-cell coupling and period differences between cells can generate the observed waves of clock gene expression.

The study estimated the coupling strength between cells and found evidence of coupling, especially in the root tip. A model showed that the observed period differences, combined with cell-to-cell coupling, can produce the observed waves in clock gene expression. The results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points, unlike the centralized mammalian clock.

The study's findings contradict previous hierarchical models of the plant clock, which do not explain the observed short period oscillations in the root tip or the wave of clock gene expression up from the root tip. Instead, the results support a more decentralized model of clock coordination in plants. The study's use of a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) allowed for the examination of the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single-cell level over several days.

The researchers calculated the order parameter from their single-cell data and estimated the coupling strength based on a technique developed for mammalian circadian cells. The results show that the damping of rhythms at the whole-plant level is mainly due to desynchronization of oscillating single cells with different periods, rather than noise in gene expression or damping of individual oscillations. Overall, the study provides new insights into the structure and robustness of the plant circadian clock system.

Researchers have developed a new imaging technique using adaptive optics to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels in the living retina of mice. The technique, called AOSLO imaging, uses an ultrafast camera to capture images of blood cells without the need for foreign contrast agents or surgery. This allows for the measurement of blood flow in vessels with diameters ranging from 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers, covering the full spectrum of retinal vessel sizes.

Using this technique, the researchers were able to measure the speed of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second, providing a high-throughput velocity measurement. The imaging paradigm was paired with an automated analysis workflow, enabling the measurement of single-cell velocity and flow rate in the smallest to largest vessels of the mouse retinal circulation. The results showed that the flow rate ranged from 0.0002 to 1.55 microliters per minute across the full range of vessel sizes.

The study's findings have significant implications for the understanding of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries, which are difficult to evaluate early on due to the limitations of current imaging techniques. The researchers suggest that the eye may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the central nervous system and systemic microvascular health. Additionally, the technique may be directly applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation.

The study's imaging capabilities enabled single blood cell resolution as they flowed in both tight and sparsely packed formations inside microvessels, allowing for sub-micrometer precision when measuring the lumen diameters of retinal vessels. A total of 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied using this technique, providing a comprehensive understanding of blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the mouse retinal circulation. The results of this study have the potential to advance our understanding of microvascular diseases and may lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how plants form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, to acquire essential nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen. A key receptor-like kinase called Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK) plays a crucial role in the development of these symbiotic relationships. However, the mechanisms that determine whether a plant will form a symbiotic relationship with a fungus or a bacterium have remained unclear.

     In this study, researchers investigated the function of SYMRK and two other receptor-like kinases, Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1) and NFR5, in the development of symbiotic relationships in the legume plant Lotus japonicus. The researchers found that overexpressing NFR1, NFR5, or SYMRK in the plant's roots led to the spontaneous formation of nodules, which are specialized organs where nitrogen-fixing bacteria live and fix nitrogen for the plant.

     The researchers also found that NFR1 and NFR5 associated with endogenous SYMRK in the plant's roots, suggesting that these receptors work together to initiate the symbiotic relationship. However, overexpressing NFR1 or NFR5 alone did not trigger the formation of nodules, while overexpressing SYMRK did. This suggests that SYMRK plays a key role in the decision between forming a symbiotic relationship with a fungus or a bacterium.

     The researchers propose that SYMRK may form complexes with other receptors, including NFR1 and NFR5, to initiate the symbiotic relationship. This complex formation may lead to the release of negative regulatory mechanisms, allowing the plant to form a symbiotic relationship with either a fungus or a bacterium. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of symbiotic relationships in plants and has important implications for our understanding of how plants interact with their environment.

     The researchers also found that overexpressing SYMRK, but not NFR1 or NFR5, triggered the expression of genes related to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, a symbiotic relationship between plants and fungi. This suggests that SYMRK plays a key role in the decision between forming a symbiotic relationship with a fungus or a bacterium.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of symbiotic relationships in plants and has important implications for our understanding of how plants interact with their environment. The discovery of the role of SYMRK in the decision between forming a symbiotic relationship with a fungus or a bacterium has the potential to improve our understanding of plant biology and may have applications in agriculture and biotechnology.

     A new software toolkit called DeepPoseKit has been developed to estimate animal posture using deep learning models. The toolkit addresses the limitations of current animal pose estimation methods in terms of speed and robustness. DeepPoseKit uses an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model called Stacked DenseNet and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm to estimate keypoint locations with subpixel precision. This approach improves processing speed by more than two times compared to existing methods without compromising accuracy. The toolkit is designed to be easy to use and has been demonstrated on multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals. The code, documentation, and examples for DeepPoseKit are freely available under a permissive open-source license.

     DeepPoseKit builds on the state-of-the-art for individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks, achieving fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization ability. The Stacked DenseNet model offers significant improvements over existing models and can run inference at a rate of 30-110 Hz, depending on the resolution of the predicted confidence maps. In contrast to conventional computer-vision methods, deep-learning-based methods can achieve near-human-level accuracy in various scenarios by manually annotating data and training a general-purpose image-processing algorithm.

     The development of DeepPoseKit aims to reduce barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences. The toolkit has the potential to lead to the creation of larger, higher-resolution, and more reliable behavioral datasets, which could revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment. Overall, DeepPoseKit provides a powerful tool for automatically measuring animal posture from images and videos, enabling researchers to collect more accurate and detailed data on animal behavior.

     Biomedical research has identified a novel mechanism by which innate immune cells, such as macrophages, respond to environmental stresses or infection by pathogens. When these cells are challenged, they form multi-protein complexes called inflammasomes, which initiate pro-inflammatory responses and a form of cell death known as pyroptosis. A recent study has revealed that the disruption of glycolytic flux, or the breakdown of glucose for energy production, serves as an intracellular trigger for NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production, and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. This signal is mediated by a drop in NADH levels and the induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which can be rescued by the addition of products that restore NADH production.

The study found that the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium impairs NADH production, leading to the formation of mitochondrial ROS, which are essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This suggests that disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation, mediated by mitochondrial redox changes. The researchers propose that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, activating NLRP3 to initiate inflammatory responses.

Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and S. typhimurium effectively limited glycolysis, resulting in NLRP3-mediated inflammasome formation and pyroptosis. The study also found that the NAD+ consumption rate increased upon pyruvate treatment, indicating induction of productive metabolism downstream of glycolysis in infected BMDMs. These data indicate that glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate immune cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhimurium infection and induce a pro-inflammatory response via NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death.

Furthermore, the study suggests that innate immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as a danger signal, resulting in inflammasome formation, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine secretion. Disrupting glycolytic flux serves as a trigger for inflammation and cell death in macrophages, and supplementation of the glycolytic product pyruvate resulted in significant reductions in caspase-1 activation, IL-1β secretion, and cell death induced by GB111-NH2. These findings reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.
Summary
     The PALB2 protein plays a crucial role in maintaining chromosomal integrity by facilitating homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). PALB2 interacts with BRCA1 and BRCA2, two tumor suppressors linked to breast cancer and Fanconi anemia, to coordinate their functions during HDR. In addition to its role as a scaffold protein, PALB2 binds directly to DNA, but the functional significance of this interaction was poorly understood.

     Researchers have identified a major DNA-binding site on PALB2, mutations in which reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency by 50% in cells. The N-terminal DNA-binding domain (N-DBD) of PALB2 stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase, which is essential for HDR. Surprisingly, the N-DBD also exhibits strand exchange activity without the presence of RAD51, and can use both DNA and RNA substrates. This novel activity highlights the versatility of PALB2's DNA interaction properties.

     Mutations in four specific amino acids within the DNA-binding site significantly impair RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency. The N-DBD of PALB2 can stimulate RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro, even in the absence of RAD51. This suggests that PALB2's DNA-binding activity is critical for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to DSB sites and efficient DNA repair in cells.

     The study demonstrates that PALB2's interaction with DNA is essential for its function in HDR. The PALB2 N-DBD's ability to stimulate RAD51-mediated strand exchange and use RNA as a substrate reveals a novel activity of PALB2. These findings highlight the importance of PALB2's DNA-binding activity in maintaining chromosomal integrity and suggest that mutations in PALB2's DNA-binding site may contribute to the development of cancer. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PALB2's role in DNA repair and its potential as a target for cancer therapy.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have made a significant discovery regarding the structure and function of MreB, a prokaryotic actin homologue. Unlike other actin-like proteins, which form filaments with parallel protofilaments, MreB from Caulobacter crescentus forms antiparallel double filaments. This unique arrangement allows each subunit to interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongasome.

     The researchers used crystal structures and electron microscopy to visualize the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments in vitro and in vivo. They found that a protofilament doublet is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance and demonstrated the antiparallel orientation of MreB protofilaments in E. coli using in vivo site-specific cross-linking. Three-dimensional cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) revealed that pairs of protofilaments of Caulobacter MreB tightly bind to membranes.

     Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerization states of Caulobacter MreB showed conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. The researchers also found that the antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilizing double protofilaments.

     The antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments ensures that the amphipathic helix of both protofilaments can bind to the membrane and that both protofilaments can interact with bitopic proteins, such as RodZ. Deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix and mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop made the protein (ΔCcMreBdh) less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of Caulobacter MreB (ΔCcMreBdh) revealed the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft.

     These findings provide new insights into the structure and function of MreB and its role in cell shape maintenance. The discovery of the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments expands our understanding of the actin family of proteins and has implications for the development of new antimicrobial agents.

     Biologists have long recognized the importance of invariant floral forms in the reproductive success of plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, flowers consistently have four petals, whereas in the closely related species Cardamine hirsuta, petal number varies. To understand the genetic basis for this difference, researchers investigated the role of the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 (AP1) in petal number robustness. They found that divergence in AP1 between the two species can account for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness. Specifically, Arabidopsis thaliana AP1 masks the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling petal number in Cardamine hirsuta, thereby conferring robustness. In contrast, Cardamine hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function of Arabidopsis thaliana AP1, resulting in variable petal number.

     The researchers also discovered that upstream regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to the divergence in petal number robustness between the two species. Furthermore, they found that variable petal number is maintained in Cardamine hirsuta despite sufficient standing genetic variation in natural accessions to produce plants with four-petalled flowers. This suggests that AP1 divergence likely exposed cryptic genetic variation in Cardamine hirsuta that contributes directly to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of the species.

     The study identified AP1 as a gene of major effect in the evolutionary transition from a robust phenotype of four petals in Arabidopsis thaliana to a variable petal number in Cardamine hirsuta. However, AP1 polymorphisms do not contribute directly to within-species variation in Cardamine hirsuta petal number. Instead, the decanalization of petal number in Arabidopsis thaliana reflects its robustness to genetic variation. The researchers were able to change Arabidopsis thaliana petal number to variable by complementing ap1 mutants with the AP1 genomic locus from Cardamine hirsuta. These flowers mimicked the variable petal number found in Cardamine hirsuta, suggesting that there may be variability in the gene regulatory network controlling petal number in Arabidopsis thaliana that is hidden beneath the uniformity of wild-type development.

     Biomedical research has identified proinsulin misfolding as an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes. Proinsulin is a precursor to insulin, a hormone critical for metabolic homeostasis, and its proper folding is essential for its function. In normal pancreatic islets, a subset of proinsulin molecules contains at least one free cysteine thiol. However, in islets with a perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) folding environment, non-native proinsulin forms intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. These complexes are more abundant in genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets and in leptin receptor-deficient mice, where they track with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes.

     The study found that proinsulin-Cys (B19) and Cys (A20) are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes. Proinsulin Cys (B19)-Cys (B19) covalent homodimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation. The research also established that proinsulin misfolding includes the inability to successfully complete its three internal disulfide bonds, with a subfraction of proinsulin molecules in the ER bearing unpaired cysteine residues. These improperly folded proinsulin molecules enter into aberrant disulfide-linked partnerships with other proinsulin molecules in the ER, resulting in misfolded proinsulin complexes.

     The study used several independent lines of evidence to establish the presence of aberrant disulfide-linked proinsulin complexes in the β-cells of human islets and model systems, in states that alter the ER folding environment, and in T2D progression prior to onset of β-cell dedifferentiation or death. In genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets, disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant, and in leptin receptor-deficient mice, the further increase of such complexes tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. The research suggests that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.
summary
     The article investigates the role of Suv39h1, a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase, in assembling silent heterochromatin. Suv39h1 recognizes trimethylated H3K9 (H3K9me3) via its chromodomain (CD) and targets specific chromosomal regions. However, the detailed targeting mechanisms, especially for naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3, are poorly understood.

     The study reveals that Suv39h1's CD (Suv39h1-CD) binds nucleic acids, with a higher affinity for RNA than DNA, and this binding is independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Suv39h1 binds major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowers Suv39h1 retention on pericentromere. Mutational studies indicate that both the nucleic acid-binding and H3K9me-binding activities of Suv39h1-CD are crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly.

     The results suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating Suv39H's target specificity. Suv39h1's nucleic acid-binding activity integrates and cooperates with its recognition and binding of methylated H3K9 to establish/maintain Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin, including H3K9me3 formation, HP1 accumulation, and transcriptionally repressive status.

     The study also shows that Suv39h1's RNA-binding activity contributes to its stable association with H3K9me3-rich pericentromeric regions. Knockdown of major satellite repeat transcripts further supports the notion that RNA binding of Suv39h1 contributes to its stability on chromatin. The results demonstrate that the four different activities of Suv39h1, including nucleic acid-binding, H3K9me-binding, HP1-binding, and chromatin-binding, cooperatively regulate Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the entorhinal cortex, a region of the brain involved in spatial navigation, contains grid cells that allow for precise decoding of position in space. These grid cells have been hypothesized to contribute to mental operations beyond navigation, but this requires that their activity does not depend on physical movement. A recent study investigated whether grid cell activity in the entorhinal cortex is modulated by spatial attention, even in the absence of movement.

     The study used a task where monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus moving in the periphery. The researchers recorded the activity of 141 neurons in the entorhinal cortex of two rhesus macaque monkeys performing this task. The results showed that a significant population of entorhinal cells (20/141, 14%) exhibited spatially structured receptive fields with a triangular tiling of space, similar to grid cells.

     This finding contrasts with recordings obtained in the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed. The study's results provide evidence that neurons in the macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement to activate grid cells. Instead, the activation of these cells is modulated by spatial attention, even in the absence of movement.

     The study's findings support the hypothesis that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex participate in a range of cognitive functions, including attentional processes. The results also suggest that the neural substrate for overt and covert attention is largely overlapping, and that grid cells may represent not only gaze location but also the locus of attention in general.

     The study's methodology involved training monkeys to perform a covert attention tracking task, where they maintained central fixation while attending to a small dot moving around a computer monitor. The monkeys performed the task at >70% accuracy, with the majority of errors due to saccades to outside of the fixation window. The researchers evaluated the standard gridness measure to examine spatial representations among entorhinal neurons.

     Overall, the study's results provide strong evidence that the activation of cells in the entorhinal cortex with spatially structured firing fields does not require physical movement through an environment. Instead, the activation of these cells is modulated by spatial attention, even in the absence of movement. This finding has implications for our understanding of the neural basis of spatial cognition and attentional processes.
Summary
     Researchers have developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice, which can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. The task, designed for head-fixed mice, assesses perceptual and value-based decision-making. To ensure reproducibility, the researchers standardized the training protocol, experimental hardware, software, and procedures across seven laboratories in three countries. A total of 140 mice were trained, and over 5 million mouse choices were collected into a publicly available database.

     The results show that while learning speed varied across mice and laboratories, once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice from different laboratories relied similarly on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These findings demonstrate that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior.

     To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, the researchers adopted an open science approach, sharing the hardware and software components, as well as the experimental protocols. This approach allows the broader community to access and build upon the data and techniques used in the study. The results provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools for studying decision-making in mice, which can be leveraged by researchers to explore the neural basis of decision-making.

     The study's findings have implications for the field of neuroscience, where reproducibility has been a concern. By establishing a standardized task and protocol, researchers can now compare results across laboratories, knowing that any differences are unlikely to be due to differences in behavior. The study also aims to catalyze the development of new adaptations and variations of the approach, accelerating the use of mice in high-quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates of decision-making. Overall, the study provides a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.
Researchers have created an atlas of gene expression and cell types in the intestine of Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian flatworm capable of regenerating all organs, including the gut. Using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), they identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression that were previously undetected. The study revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans.

The researchers found that the planarian intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, nutrient storage and transport, innate immunity, and other physiological roles, demonstrating functional homology with digestive systems of other animals. They also identified 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several required for the production and/or maintenance of goblet cells. Goblet cells play a crucial role in the production of mucus, which is essential for the proper functioning of the digestive system.

Using LCM, the researchers were able to uncover previously unappreciated regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly among intestinal goblet cells. They identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, which play distinct roles in goblet cell differentiation and maintenance. Depletion of goblet cells was found to reduce the planarians' willingness to feed and viability, with only negligible effects on the regeneration of other intestinal cell types or non-intestinal tissues.

The study provides a foundational resource for investigating mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration. The characterization of the planarian intestinal transcriptome enables the identification of genes required for regeneration and functions of distinct intestinal cell types. The findings have implications for understanding the evolutionary conservation of intestinal gene expression and the consolidation of physiological roles performed by multiple human digestive organs in the planarian intestine. The study sets the stage for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration.
summary
     Biomedical research has revealed a novel mechanism of peripheral sensory coding in weakly electric fish, where sensory receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors. This synchrony encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. The receptors are most sensitive to frequencies found in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, and this sensitivity is correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies.

     The study investigated how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to differences in peripheral sensory coding. Mormyrid fish communicate by producing a species-specific electric organ discharge (EOD) at variable interpulse intervals (IPIs). However, oscillating receptors are tuned to much lower frequencies than the peak power frequencies of conspecific EODs. These oscillation frequencies confer enhanced sensitivity to IPIs that can only be produced by groups of fish. In contrast, spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals.

     Behavioral playback experiments demonstrated that a species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within the range of enhanced receptor sensitivity. This suggests that the novel peripheral coding mechanism may represent an adaptation for detecting communication signals from large groups of fish. The study also found that oscillatory electrical activity is widespread in neural networks, and that species with oscillating receptors exhibit selective behavioral responses to submillisecond IPIs, while species with spiking receptors do not.

     The findings provide evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony and suggest that different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. The study hypothesizes that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. The research provides new insights into the neural basis of sensory perception and communication in weakly electric fish, and has implications for our understanding of the evolution of sensory systems in response to environmental pressures.

Scientists have studied how the dengue virus (DENV) adapts to its two main hosts: humans and mosquitoes. To understand this process, researchers used a technique called ultra-deep sequencing to analyze the genetic changes that occur in DENV populations when they are grown in human and mosquito cells. This allowed them to identify the effects of individual genetic mutations on the virus's fitness, or ability to survive and reproduce.

The study found that the DENV population is constantly accumulating deleterious mutations, which are genetic changes that harm the virus's ability to function. However, these deleterious mutations are balanced by rare beneficial mutations that help the virus adapt to its host environment. The researchers discovered that beneficial mutations tend to occur in specific regions of the DENV genome and are often found in areas of the viral proteome that are structurally flexible.

The study also identified "hotspots" of adaptation, which are specific locations in the genome where beneficial mutations are more likely to occur. These hotspots were found to be enriched in regions of the DENV genome that are involved in interactions with the host cell. The researchers used a three-dimensional model of the dengue protein E to visualize these hotspots and understand how they contribute to the virus's ability to adapt to its host.

The findings of this study suggest that the evolution of DENV is shaped by a balance between the accumulation of deleterious mutations and the occurrence of beneficial mutations that help the virus adapt to its host environment. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the structural and functional features of the DENV genome and proteome in shaping the virus's ability to evolve and adapt.

The researchers used a technique called CirSeq to analyze the fitness landscapes of DENV populations adapting to human and mosquito cells. This technique allowed them to trace the trajectories of individual allele trajectories for almost all possible single nucleotide variants across the DENV genome. The study found that adaptation relies on host-specific beneficial mutations that are clustered in specific regions of the DENV genome and enriched in regions of the proteome that exhibit structural flexibility.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of DENV and other viruses that cycle between different host environments. The results suggest that the evolutionary constraints observed in this study may be relevant to other DENV and Zika strains, highlighting the importance of understanding the biophysical and biological constraints that shape long-term viral evolution.
Using single-particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) and detailed trajectory analysis, researchers have identified distinct membrane domains that dictate the diffusion and trafficking of KRasG12D, an active mutant of the KRas protein, in U2OS cells. The study reveals that KRasG12D exhibits an immobile state in approximately 70-nanometer domains, which are embedded in larger domains of around 200 nanometers that confer intermediate mobility. The remaining membrane supports fast diffusion of KRasG12D.

The researchers found that KRasG12D is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, a process reminiscent of Ras internalization and recycling. Importantly, the partitioning of KRasG12D into the three states remains invariant over a wide range of protein expression levels, demonstrating that KRasG12D diffusion and trafficking through the three mobility states and associated nanodomains is in a maintained, homeostatic condition.

Further analysis revealed that the intermediate and immobile states of KRasG12D are each associated with distinct membrane domains. The measured sizes of the immobilization and intermediate domains of KRasG12D were approximately 70 nanometers and 200 nanometers, respectively, consistent with previous beliefs that nanoscopic membrane domains regulate Ras organization on the membrane.

Based on these results, the researchers propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D, where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking, with implications in Ras multimer formation and signaling. The study sheds new light on how complex nanodomains organize on the membrane to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking, offering useful guidance for future experiments that aim to determine the molecular and structural identities of the Ras-associated membrane nanodomains and define the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling. The findings suggest that the various membrane nanodomains directly influence the mobility, trafficking, and potentially multimer formation and signaling of KRasG12D, although details of the trafficking and multimer formation processes are yet to be defined.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling gradient forms during embryonic development, particularly in patterning the dorsoventral (DV) axis of vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates suggests that a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, along with ligand shuttling, generates peak signaling levels. However, a recent study in zebrafish has shed new light on this mechanism.

     The researchers developed a robust quantitative imaging method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient in wild-type and mutant zebrafish embryos. They combined these data with a mathematical model-based computational screen to test hypotheses for gradient formation. The analysis ruled out a BMP shuttling mechanism and a BMP transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism. Instead, the study supports a source-sink mechanism, where a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acts as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation.

     The researchers measured Bmp2 diffusion and found that it supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development. This finding contradicts the prevailing view that a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists generates the BMP signaling gradient. The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of BMP signaling and its role in patterning the DV axis during embryonic development.

     Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) act as morphogens repeatedly during development, including in patterning the embryonic DV axis, the neural tube, and the Drosophila wing disc. BMP morphogen systems are established by a network of extracellular regulators. In vertebrates, the mechanism by which the BMP ligands and antagonists shape this gradient is unclear. Several potential mechanisms have been proposed, including an inverse gradient of BMP antagonists and BMP antagonists generating peak BMP signaling levels by shuttling BMP ligand to these regions.

     The study's findings suggest that the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is formed through a source-sink mechanism, where a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acts as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. This new understanding of BMP gradient formation has significant implications for our understanding of BMP signaling and its role in patterning the DV axis during embryonic development.
Summary
     The lysosomal transporter MFSD1 plays a crucial role in maintaining liver homeostasis. MFSD1 is a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, which mediate secondary active or passive transport processes across cellular membranes. Research has shown that MFSD1 is localized in lysosomes, where it facilitates the export of low-molecular-weight catabolic end-products. However, the function and regulation of MFSD1 remained poorly understood until recently.

     A detailed analysis of MFSD1 revealed that it is not N-glycosylated and contains a dileucine-based sorting motif necessary for its transport to lysosomes. Mice lacking MFSD1 (Mfsd1 knockout mice) developed splenomegaly and severe liver disease, indicating the importance of MFSD1 in maintaining normal liver function. Proteomics analysis of isolated lysosomes from Mfsd1 knockout mice identified GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD1. GLMP is a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein of unknown function prior to this study.

     The interaction between MFSD1 and GLMP is essential for maintaining normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes, and vice versa. Mice lacking GLMP (Glmp knockout mice) exhibited a similar phenotype to Mfsd1 knockout mice, further supporting the importance of the MFSD1/GLMP complex in liver homeostasis. These findings suggest that MFSD1 and GLMP form a tightly linked lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex.

     The study also investigated the role of MFSD1 in lysosomal function by analyzing the composition of lysosomes from wildtype and Mfsd1 knockout mice. The results showed that MFSD1 is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady-state conditions and is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues. The transport of MFSD1 to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in the N-terminus.

     Overall, the research highlights the importance of MFSD1 and its accessory subunit GLMP in maintaining liver homeostasis and suggests that the MFSD1/GLMP complex plays a critical role in lysosomal function. The findings provide new insights into the regulation and function of lysosomal transporters and have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of liver disease.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the mechanism of kinesin motors, which are essential for various cellular processes in eukaryotes. Kinesin motors use ATP hydrolysis to transport cargo along microtubules. To gain insight into this process, the researchers developed atomic models of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules using cryo-EM reconstructions at 5-6 Å resolution. These models were compared with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin to infer a mechanistic scheme.

     The researchers found that microtubule attachment, mediated by a conserved 'linchpin' residue in kinesin (N255), triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft, tightly coupling to translocation of cargo via kinesin's 'neck linker' element. This structural transition is similar to the nucleotide-exchange steps in myosin and F1-ATPase motors.

     The researchers also identified sites in the kinesin fold that uncouple the motor's nucleotide affinity from its microtubule affinity, providing a structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules. To clarify the mechanism of kinesin's microtubule-attached cycle, the researchers solved high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions of the human monomeric kinesin motor domain attached to the microtubule in two different chemical states, representing the motor before and after ATP binding.

     The no-nucleotide and ATP-bound models of the kinesin-microtubule complex revealed a clamshell-like closure of kinesin's nucleotide cleft triggered by ATP binding on microtubules. Cryo-EM analysis of the ADP and ATP analog-bound states of the N255K point mutant of the construct supported this hypothesis, revealing two previously unidentified binding modes of kinesin in which the motor domain attaches tightly to the microtubule but is rotationally mobile. The corresponding 3D maps did not refine to high resolution due to mobility of the kinesin heads.

     Maintaining the proper functioning of mitochondria requires mechanisms to identify and remove misfolded proteins. However, the quality control (QC) pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins are not well understood. Researchers have identified two temperature-sensitive (ts-) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) proteins, sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts, as novel model QC substrates in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These proteins are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

The ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase (E3) Ubr1, while sam35-2HAts is primarily ubiquitinated by San1. The degradation of both substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1, providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in mitochondrial-associated degradation (MAD). In addition to the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1 and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor, Ubx2, are also implicated in their degradation.

This study reveals a unique QC pathway that involves a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors, distinguishing it from other cellular QC pathways. The researchers found that ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation play a crucial role in the turnover of sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts at the MOM. The Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex is essential for the efficient proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates, and it can be recruited to substrates via Cdc48's interaction with co-factors.

Mitochondrial proteins are subject to ongoing oxidative insults that can result in damage, misfolding, and dysfunction. The researchers further assessed whether ubiquitin-modified forms of the ts- proteins were localized to mitochondria under conditions of proteasome impairment. They found that ubiquitinated sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts accumulated largely in the mitochondrial pellet fraction and to a lesser extent in the soluble fraction, correlating with the relative distributions of unmodified species.

Deletion of the proteasome shuttling factor Ddi1 did not affect the degradation of sam35-2HAts or sen2-1HAts, further distinguishing MAD from ERAD. These results indicate that ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates require the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex for efficient proteasomal degradation. Overall, this study provides new insights into the QC pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins and highlights the importance of the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex in their degradation.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how growth signals are generated and propagated throughout tissues, particularly in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) plays a crucial role in this process, acting as a key effector of many growth signaling pathways. To visualize ERK activity in living mice, scientists developed an ERK Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor, which allowed them to monitor ERK activity in epidermal cells at single-cell resolution.

    Using this biosensor, the researchers observed that ERK activity propagated radially from cell to cell in the epidermis, a phenomenon they termed "Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution" (SPREAD). This propagation occurred in bursts, with ERK activity originating from a few cells and spreading up to a radius of approximately 50 micrometers over 30 minutes before disappearing. The frequency of SPREADs correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division, suggesting a link between ERK activity and cell proliferation.

    The researchers also found that SPREADs were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), a compound that activates epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) and their cognate ligands. This suggests that EGFR signaling is involved in the propagation of ERK activity. Furthermore, the researchers observed that ERK activation propagated as a "trigger wave" in parallel to the wound edge in wounded skin, indicating that ERK activation can be superimposed.

    By visualizing the cell cycle, the researchers found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression, providing new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronized in a living tissue. These findings contribute to our understanding of how growth signals are generated and propagated in the epidermis and have implications for our understanding of tissue homeostasis and wound healing. The development of the ERK FRET biosensor and the observation of SPREADs provide new tools and insights for studying the regulation of ERK activity in living tissues.
Scientists have studied the circadian clock in cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria that responds to daily light-dark cycles, to understand how it adapts to changing day lengths throughout the year. The circadian clock is a biological process that regulates daily changes in physiology, but its alignment with external cycles is not well understood. In this study, researchers developed experimental platforms to drive the cyanobacterial circadian clock both in living cells (in vivo) and in a laboratory setting (in vitro). They found that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in response to light-dark cycles, tracking midday across conditions with variable day lengths.

The core biochemical oscillator, composed of the Kai proteins, behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that these dynamics are intrinsic to the proteins. This suggests that the ability to track midday is an inherent property of the core oscillator, rather than requiring additional factors present in the cell. The researchers also developed a general mathematical framework based on instantaneous transformation of the clock cycle by external cues, which successfully predicts clock behavior under many cycling environments.

This framework can be used to guide experiments that probe the molecular origins of key mathematical features of the circadian clock. The precisely defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates such experiments, and the model is expected to be useful for other organisms as well. By reconstituting the core oscillator in vitro from purified Kai proteins, the researchers simulated seasonal effects by driving the Kai proteins with pulses of nucleotides on a 24-hour cycle, simulating in vivo metabolic conditions during day and night. The in vitro system showed a similar linear scaling of clock phase with simulated day length, indicating that core mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to the Kai proteins.

The data reduction achieved in the linear model holds the promise of predicting the behavior of the circadian rhythms in many time-varying environments from a minimal data set that characterizes oscillator response. This may be applicable to clocks in many organisms. The analysis suggests that a key determinant of entrained behavior is how the clock limit cycle is deformed by coupling to the environment. Overall, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock and its adaptation to changing day lengths throughout the year.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in the general population. Genome-wide association studies have identified the transcription factor Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. A recent study investigated the role of Meis1 in the development and function of sympathetic neurons, which play a crucial role in regulating heart rate and rhythm.

The study found that inactivating Meis1 in the neural crest of mice led to altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects. This resulted in an increased susceptibility to SCD. Further investigation revealed that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that Meis1-deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages.

The study also showed that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery, and that the traffic of Rab5+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. This suggests that Meis1 interacts with various trophic factors signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons differentiation.

Meis1 was found to regulate the transcription of proteins necessary for retrograde transport, endosomes formation, functioning, and traffic. The study demonstrated that genetic inactivation of Meis1 in rodents results in an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of heart functions, leading to conduction defects, chronotropic incompetence, and premature SCD. Meis1 was shown to act independently of the well-studied network of transcription factors governing early specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later phases of neuronal differentiation.

The study aimed to investigate whether Meis1 participates in neural aspects of cardiac regulation by intervening in the differentiation of sympathetic neurons and how Meis1 mutations could mediate susceptibility to unexplained SCD. The results highlight that loss of Meis1 function in early sympathetic neurons leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adult mice, resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD. The study also found that following specific inactivation of Meis1 in peripheral neurons, the traffic of Rab5+ early endosomes is impaired and sympathetic target-field innervation is compromised.

These findings complement a previous study demonstrating Meis1 function in the regulation of neonatal cardiomyocytes mitosis, especially following myocardial infarction. However, cardiac functions were not affected following specific Meis1 inactivation or overexpression in cardiomyocytes. The study suggests that Meis1 plays a critical role in the development and function of sympathetic neurons, and its loss may contribute to the increased susceptibility to SCD.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how surface-attached bacterial communities, known as biofilms, develop their diverse range of morphologies. While the structural and regulatory components necessary for biofilm formation are well understood, the mechanisms that promote biofilm surface morphology remain unclear. Using Vibrio cholerae as a model system, researchers have investigated the role of mechanical instabilities and interfacial energy in biofilm morphogenesis.

     The study reveals that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, play a crucial role in the development of biofilm surface morphology. These instabilities are driven by compressive stress that builds up as the biofilm grows. The researchers used a combination of mechanical measurements, theory, simulation, quantitative image analysis, surface energy characterization, and mutagenesis to demonstrate that mechanical instabilities underlie the morphogenesis program of growing biofilms.

     In addition to mechanical instabilities, the study shows that interfacial energy is a key driving force for mechanomorphogenesis. Interfacial energy dictates the creation or annihilation of new or existing interfaces, which in turn shapes the overall biofilm contour. The researchers also discovered feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion, which further influences the biofilm's surface morphology.

     The findings of this study suggest that exploiting mechanical principles to drive key morphogenic events is an ancient process that has been reused in eukaryotes. Biofilms represent an intriguing model system for investigating the general role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis, and they provide a convenient system for morpho-engineering. The study's results have implications for the development of new strategies to address biofilm-related problems, such as the discovery of new genes and compounds that alter biofilm morphology by altering mechanics.

     The researchers propose a mechanomorphogenesis model, which suggests that biofilms first wrinkle and subsequently delaminate as growth builds up compressive stress. This model predicts that changing the spatial distribution of mechanical stress can alter the biofilm topography. The study also highlights the importance of considering the connections between a biofilm's surface morphology and its mechanical and material properties in the development of new strategies to address biofilm-related problems.
summary
     The study investigated the role of the transcription factor NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor) in the development of epilepsy. The researchers found that NRSF levels increased in the hippocampus following seizures, but surprisingly, only a small subset of genes regulated by NRSF were repressed. This subset of genes included those involved in ion channels, receptors, and calcium-related molecules, which are crucial for neuronal function and plasticity. The repression of these genes by NRSF may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

     The study used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. The results showed that a twofold to threefold increase in NRSF levels, induced by epilepsy-provoking seizures, led to the repression of only a subset of potentially regulated genes. These genes were rescued when NRSF function was blocked, indicating that NRSF is responsible for their repression.

     The researchers also found that the subset of genes repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, making them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels. This selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a role in influencing neuronal properties in both pathological and physiological contexts. The study suggests that NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating a group of genes that critically influence neuronal function.

     The key findings of the study are: (1) NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating a group of genes that critically influence neuronal function; (2) only a few dozen of the hundreds of hippocampal genes that are potential NRSF targets are actually repressed by the transcription factor in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy; and (3) the basis of the selective regulation of a subset of NRSF target genes is their mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, making them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels.
Summary
     The mammalian olfactory system processes sensory information through parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory bulb. These parallel pathways are a common feature of many sensory systems, but how local circuit activity creates stimulus selectivity in parallel pathways remains poorly understood. Researchers investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells in mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits.

     The study found differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tufted cells, which likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations showed that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tufted cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges. This suggests that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways.

     The olfactory system is similar to the visual system in that distinct outputs are generated from initially homogeneous sources. In the retina, feature selectivity in each ganglion cell type emerges due to its connectivity to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types. Similarly, differences in odor-evoked responses in mitral and tufted cells emerge due to differences in connectivity to olfactory sensory neurons and external tufted cells.

     The combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables tufted and mitral cells to collectively encode odors better than either population alone. This supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms behind parallel processing in sensory systems and highlights the importance of local circuit activity in creating stimulus selectivity in parallel pathways.
Summary
     The M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allostery in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), has been studied to understand the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allosteric effects. Allosteric interactions were monitored using a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. The results showed that allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands.

     In contrast, allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending on the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations. The study aimed to understand how a multimeric complex might account for allosteric behavior that resists explanation in terms of monomers.

     The M2 muscarinic receptor has been a prototype for allosteric effects within the broader family of GPCRs. Most studies of the interaction of an allosteric ligand with the allosteric site have been based on the modulation of events at the orthosteric site, typically on receptors in native membranes or detergent-solubilized extracts. Allosteric effects were examined in molecular dynamics simulations at the atomic level, starting from the crystal structure of the monomeric M2 receptor occupied by the agonist iperoxo (4MQS). The ligand and accessory proteins were removed, and conformations of the receptor were sampled from a canonical ensemble accessible within a period of 30 ns.

     The study compared positive and negative allosteric modulators for their effects on oligomers and purified monomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor. The results showed that the oligomeric nature of the M2 receptor is evident in the multiphasic effects of allosteric ligands on the dissociation rate of orthosteric antagonists and their binding at equilibrium. The chemical structures of allosteric and orthosteric ligands to the M2 muscarinic receptor were also examined, including N-methylscopolamine, quinuclidinylbenzilate, strychnine, and gallamine. Different liganded states of the receptor were identified as X_R_Y, where X and Y are the allosteric and orthosteric ligands, respectively.
Summary
     The study investigated the role of SETD2, a histone-modifying enzyme, in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). SETD2 is responsible for trimethylating histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3), a modification that plays a crucial role in establishing chromatin states that coordinate the DNA damage response. The researchers found that SETD2 is necessary for the activation of the ATM kinase, a key player in the DNA damage response, following DNA damage. Additionally, SETD2 is required for the homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments.

The study used reporter assays to demonstrate that depletion of SETD2 impairs the DNA damage response (DDR) and leads to delayed recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs. Furthermore, SETD2-depleted cells showed reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs. The researchers also found that SETD2 mutations are present in several cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), which is characterized by a high rate of genomic alterations and inactivating mutations in histone modifiers, such as SETD2.

The study provides evidence that SETD2 plays a novel role in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage. Unlike other histone modifications that promote the DDR, SETD2 does not increase H3K36me3 levels at DNA damage sites or recruit SETD2 to DSBs. Instead, SETD2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5' ends. The researchers propose that SETD2 acts as a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs.

The study highlights the importance of SETD2 in maintaining genome integrity and provides a functional link between altered chromatin states and the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity. The findings suggest that loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint in cancers, such as ccRCC, without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR.
summary
     Scientists have identified a new mutation in the Rasgrp1 gene, known as Rasgrp1Anaef, which leads to the production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies and the accumulation of a specific type of T cell in mice. This mutation affects the EF-hand domain of the Rasgrp1 protein, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that plays a crucial role in cell signaling pathways.

     In mice with the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation, a distinct population of Helios+ PD-1+ T-helper cells gradually accumulates in the periphery, accompanied by the production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies. This is in contrast to previously described autoimmune mutations in Rasgrp1, Zap70, or Lat, which affect thymocyte development. The Rasgrp1Anaef mutation, however, has no detectable effect on thymocyte development in mice with normal T-cell receptor repertoires.

     Further investigation revealed that the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation leads to increased tonic mTOR signaling in naive CD4+ T cells. mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. The increased mTOR signaling in Rasgrp1Anaef mice results in the constitutive overexpression of CD44 on naive CD4+ T cells and the gradual accumulation of Helios+ CD44hi CD4+ T cells and autoantibodies.

     Genetic reduction of mTOR function in Rasgrp1Anaef mice normalizes CD44 expression on naive CD4+ T cells and abolishes the excessive accumulation of effector T cells and autoantibodies. This demonstrates a central role for increased mTOR activity in driving immune dysregulation in Rasgrp1Anaef mice. The findings of this study reveal a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells, dissociating this function from its well-known role in thymic positive selection.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family are common in cancer, but the mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to tumorigenesis are not well understood. A recent study investigated the role of Arid1a, a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation. The study used a mouse model to suppress Arid1a in the pancreas, either in adult mice or during embryogenesis, in the presence of oncogenic Kras mutations.

     The results showed that suppressing Arid1a in adult mice with Kras mutations led to rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. In contrast, suppressing Arid1a during embryogenesis, concurrent with Kras activation, resulted in retention of acinar cell fate. These findings suggest that Arid1a is a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and that the timing and genetic context of Arid1a inactivation can influence the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

     Further analysis revealed that Arid1a loss enables a non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate that is dependent on cellular and genetic context. The study also found that Arid1a disruption reduces the chromatin accessibility of key transcription factors to enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate. This suggests that Arid1a stabilizes acinar cell identity and acts as a barrier to pancreatic cancer initiation. However, other factors are likely necessary to promote the transition from pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) to PDAC.

     The study used a powerful mouse-modeling platform to demonstrate that Arid1a depletion can modulate the early stages of pancreatic neoplasia in a context-specific manner that depends on the timing of Arid1a inactivation and the presence of oncogenic Kras. The findings provide new insights into the role of Arid1a in pancreatic cancer initiation and highlight the importance of considering the timing and genetic context of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.
Biomedical research has shown that social networks play a crucial role in buffering the effects of stress in many species. However, the absence of a social network can also be stressful. A recent study examined the effects of social isolation on neuroendocrine responses in mice, specifically focusing on the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons.

The study found that isolating preadolescent female mice from their littermates for less than 24 hours altered the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion. Specifically, the first spike latency (FSL) and excitability of CRH neurons increased in isolated females, but not in age-matched males. In contrast, subjecting either males or group-housed females to acute physical stress, such as swimming, increased FSL in both groups.

The study also found that the increase in FSL following social isolation or acute physical stress was blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. This suggests that the increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that social isolation, but not acute physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons.

The researchers prepared hypothalamic brain slices and examined synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in the PVN. They found that social isolation altered the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female, but not male, mice. The study also showed that female mice, but not male mice, may interpret social isolation as a stress. When single-housed male mice were subjected to an acute swim stress, FSL increased, but in females, the prior isolation occluded the effects of an acute stress.

These findings demonstrate that males and females react differently to some stressors, but not others. Specifically, social isolation has definitive, CORT-dependent effects on CRH neurons in female, but not male mice. By contrast, both males and females show indistinguishable responses to an acute physical swim stress. Additionally, a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent physical stress on FSL in females, but has no effect on FSL in males. Overall, the study provides new insights into the sex-specific effects of social isolation on neuroendocrine responses in mice.

     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how the protein hemoglobin (Hb) adapts to meet the unique needs of different mammalian tissues for oxygen delivery. Hemoglobin is a model protein for studying molecular adaptation in vertebrates, and its ability to bind oxygen is crucial for tissue oxygen delivery. While previous research has focused on the affinity of Hb for oxygen, a new study suggests that both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding play a role in molecular adaptations of Hb.

     The study used a mathematical model to analyze the relationship between the Hill coefficient, which measures cooperativity, and the relative affinity and conformational changes of Hb. The researchers found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a "biophysical Hill landscape" that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. This suggests that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply.

     The study also found that Hb in small-sized animals with high metabolic rates has lower affinity for oxygen than Hb in large-sized animals, reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb. Furthermore, the study found a positive correlation between an animal's metabolic rate and the observed maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb. In contrast, an inverse linear correlation was found between the metabolic rate and Hb affinity.

     These findings provide evolutionary and functional insights into the mechanism underlying body-size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. The study suggests that changes in mammalian Hb binding and conformation have been tuned during evolution to give rise to close to maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding, yielding a different maximum Hill value in each case. The generality and implications of these findings are discussed, highlighting the importance of considering both affinity and cooperativity in understanding molecular adaptations of Hb. The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of how Hb adapts to meet the unique needs of different mammalian tissues for oxygen delivery.

Scientists have studied how cells adapt to the loss of a crucial component, BEM1, which is essential for cell polarization in yeast. Cell polarization is the process by which cells become organized into functional modules, and BEM1 plays a key role in this process. To understand how cells adapt to the loss of BEM1, researchers deleted the gene from yeast cells and allowed them to evolve over 1000 generations. The results showed that the cells were initially able to rapidly increase in fitness, but then slowed down and eventually reached a fitness level of over 90% of their BEM1-containing ancestors.

     Genome sequencing and monitoring of cell polarization revealed a common evolutionary trajectory, with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations that improved cell polarization by inactivating proteins. This suggests that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins, and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions.

     The researchers found that the cells adapted to the loss of BEM1 by following a reproducible evolutionary trajectory, which could be largely explained by the interactions amongst the mutated genes. This adaptation led to a substantial recovery in the speed and accuracy of cell polarization. The study also found that bem1∆ cells often contained more than one polarity site, suggesting that the positive feedback that ensures a single site of polarization is weaker.

     The results of this study demonstrate that cells can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations, and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions. This suggests that the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately also make it possible for them to adapt to very strong perturbations. Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanisms of economic commitment in the human brain using a decision-making task where participants chose whether to accept or reject prospects that provided sustained financial returns. The study aimed to understand how the brain computes value and makes economic commitments. Participants were presented with a series of choices between goods or gambles with lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. The researchers found that the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected or deferred accepting a prospect. The dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases: deferring commitments to later and weighting potential losses more heavily than gains. These biases paradoxically maximized reward in the task. The findings provide new insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex. The study used a multi-alternative choice task where decisions had financial ramifications that persisted over prolonged episodes and could not be reversed. In half of the blocks, participants had to choose between accepting and deferring acceptance of a prospect. The results showed that the dACC encoded value when a prospect was excluded, while the rmPFC encoded value only during deferral. Joint consideration of the behavioral data and dACC activity allowed the researchers to pinpoint two pressures that shaped decisions in the task: a bias to defer until a later date and a bias to weight unfavorable options more heavily. These findings contribute to our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying economic decision-making and the role of the medial prefrontal cortex in integrating value signals over time. The study's results have implications for understanding the pressures that shape economic decisions and the computation of value in the brain.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered that paraspeckles, a type of nuclear body found in cells, display a circadian expression pattern in pituitary cells. Paraspeckles are composed of long non-coding RNA, Neat1, and RNA-binding proteins, and are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by retaining mRNA in the nucleus. The researchers found that the insertion of inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu) at the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the EGFP gene led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the EGFP mRNA. This effect was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted. In contrast, the insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, the researchers showed that IRAlu drove a circadian expression of EGFP protein.

     The study suggests that paraspeckles control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by rhythmically retaining RNAs in the nucleus. The researchers used a rat pituitary cell line, the GH4C1 cells, to study the role of paraspeckles in circadian gene expression. They found that paraspeckles were rhythmically expressed in these cells and that the insertion of IRAlu at the 3'-UTR of the EGFP gene led to a circadian expression of EGFP protein.

     The study builds on previous research that has shown that paraspeckles are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and that they display a circadian expression pattern in pituitary cells. The researchers suggest that paraspeckle bodies can rhythmically retain RNAs in the nucleus, leading to a rhythmic expression of the corresponding gene. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of circadian gene expression and highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in determining oscillations at the mRNA level.

     The researchers identified several RNA-binding proteins that target antisense Alu elements within the 3'-UTR of mRNAs, including HNRNPC, which displays a circadian expression pattern in several tissues, including the mouse pituitary. The study suggests that these RNA-binding proteins may play a role in the circadian regulation of gene expression. Overall, the study provides new evidence for the role of paraspeckles in controlling circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.
Summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) in converting electrical signals into chemical communication. However, the molecules within the active zone that regulate this function have remained poorly understood. A recent study has shed light on the role of Munc13, an active-zone protein essential for exocytosis, in controlling VGCC function.

     The study demonstrates that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs via a specific pair of basic residues in its C2B domain. This interaction dictates the behavior of VGCCs during various forms of activity, including high-frequency action potential bursts and single action potential stimuli. The researchers found that eliminating this interaction by removing Munc13 or replacing it with a Munc13 C2B mutant altered the synaptic VGCC's response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts, as well as calcium influx from single action potential stimuli.

     The study's findings illustrate a novel form of synaptic modulation, where Munc13 controls both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis. This suggests that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by regulating VGCC function. The researchers pinpointed a critical interaction site to two basic residues within the C2B domain of Munc13, which is orthogonal to the potential membrane-interacting loops of this domain.

     The study's results have broad implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled. The observation that Munc13 enhances Ca2+ influx and modulates kinetic properties of VGCCs across a range of stimulation conditions implies that this modulation is mediated by a direct VGCC-Munc13 interaction. The researchers tested the significance of this interaction by examining the impact of removing Munc13 on action potential-driven calcium influx in nerve terminals. They found that VGCC failed to reactivate in 1.2 mM extracellular Ca2+ in cells lacking Munc13, suggesting that the increase in exocytosis during 2 ms ISI paired pulses in Munc13-KR/AA is a direct effect of the lack of Munc13-VGCC interaction.

     Overall, the study provides compelling evidence that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs in a way that controls calcium channel use-dependence on millisecond to second time scales at nerve terminals. This novel form of synaptic modulation has significant implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled, and highlights the critical role of Munc13 in regulating VGCC function.

     The shape and function of plant cells are intricately linked, and the puzzle-shaped cells found in the epidermis of many plants are a striking example of this relationship. However, the functional benefit of these complex cell shapes has remained unclear. Researchers propose that these intricate forms provide an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis. They suggest that when tissue-level growth is isotropic, lobes emerge at the cellular level to prevent the formation of large isodiametric cells that would bulge under the stress produced by turgor pressure.

     The researchers used data from various plant organs and species to support the relationship between lobes and growth isotropy. They also tested this relationship with mutants where growth direction was perturbed. Using simulation models, they showed that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape. The results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis.

     The researchers propose that the puzzle-shaped cells seen in the epidermis of many plant species emerge from a mechanism that evolved to limit mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. They used finite element method (FEM) analysis of 3D pressurized cells to show that cell shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell wall. When an epidermal cell becomes large in two directions, stress is greatly increased.

     To test their hypothesis, the researchers analyzed the stress in a mechanical model of the cotyledon epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that in stems, roots, and siliques, growth is strongly anisotropic, and cells can simply elongate. However, this is not possible for isodiametric organs such as broad leaves, cotyledons, and silicle fruit pods. The researchers propose that puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of more isodiametric plant organs provide a means to avoid large open areas in the cell and the high stresses that they induce.

     The researchers also propose a different function for the puzzle shape, that it is an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces that act on turgid plant cells that reside in the epidermis. They suggest that mechanically, plant cells are like small balloons inflated with considerable turgor pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells, reaching values up to 50 bar in specialized cells such as stomata.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have investigated the process of pre-spliceosome assembly in human cells to understand how introns and exons are properly connected during gene splicing. Gene splicing is a crucial step in gene expression, where introns (non-coding regions) are removed and exons (coding regions) are joined together to form a mature messenger RNA molecule. The process involves the assembly of a complex called the spliceosome, which is composed of multiple subcomplexes that interact with the pre-mRNA molecule.

     To study this process, the researchers used human nuclear extracts and fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes to observe the dynamics of pre-spliceosome assembly on individual pre-mRNA molecules. They found that the U1 subcomplex, which binds to the 5' splice site of an intron, can interact with another U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron. This interaction significantly increases the rate and efficiency of U2 subcomplex recruitment to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron.

     The researchers also discovered that the flanking 5' splice sites have a greater than additive effect on U2 recruitment, suggesting distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs. The study suggests an ordered human pre-spliceosome assembly pathway, where stable U2 association requires prior U1 binding, in contrast to the branched pathway observed in yeast.

     The researchers established methods for observing the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on and the splicing of individual pre-mRNA molecules in human cell extracts. They found that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5' splice site are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream or upstream of the 5' splice site. Pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways: cross-intron interactions leading directly to a catalytically active spliceosome, or cross-exon interactions where the exons flanking an intron are first defined, after which cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes lead to spliceosome assembly.

     The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms contributing to accurate and efficient gene splicing, highlighting the importance of collaboration between flanking 5' splice sites in promoting U2 recruitment during pre-spliceosome formation. The findings have implications for understanding the regulation of gene expression and the development of therapies for genetic disorders related to splicing defects.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a novel folding assistance system that operates on membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This system relies on a specific type of protein modification called ubiquitination, where a small protein called ubiquitin is attached to a lysine residue on the target protein. In the case of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6, ubiquitination on a specific lysine residue (Lys-1403) promotes its folding by retaining it in the ER while preventing degradation. A deubiquitinating enzyme called USP19 then removes the ubiquitin from LRP6, allowing it to exit the ER.

     This ubiquitination-deubiquitination cycle is conceptually similar to the glucosylation-deglucosylation process that occurs in the ER lumen during the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle. However, to avoid infinite futile cycles, successfully folded LRP6 molecules undergo palmitoylation and are exported from the ER, while those that fail to fold are polyubiquitinated on other lysines and targeted for degradation.

     The researchers also found that this ubiquitin-dependent folding system controls the proteostasis of other membrane proteins, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and the anthrax toxin receptor 2 (also known as Capillary Morphogenesis gene 2, CMG2). These proteins are involved in severe human diseases, such as cystic fibrosis and Hyaline Fibromatosis Syndrome. The study suggests that this ubiquitin-dependent folding system may be a general mechanism for assisting the folding of membrane proteins in the ER.

     The researchers propose that the ubiquitination of LRP6 on Lys-1403 allows it to interact with an ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone, providing the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP6 is transported out of the ER, a process that is favored by palmitoylation. If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway.
Biomedical research has shown that sex differences in cognitive processes can contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. A key area of interest is value-based decision making, where sex differences have been proposed to influence decision-making processes. However, overall performance in decision-making tasks often shows minimal differences between sexes. To uncover latent variables that define different decision-making approaches, researchers used computational tools to analyze behavior in a classic value-based decision-making task, the restless two-armed bandit, in mice.

The study found that male and female mice had similar accuracy in the task, but they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, often getting "stuck" in exploration once they started. In contrast, female mice explored less but learned more quickly during exploration. These results suggest that sex exerts a stronger influence on decision-making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices.

The study used a combination of computational modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore/exploit task. While males and females had similar performance, they used different latent explore-exploit strategies to learn about the dynamic environment. The researchers found that female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors, indicating that they were more likely to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial.

The study's findings have implications for understanding sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders. Exploration during decision-making is altered in individuals diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. The neural mechanisms of exploration are a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to these diagnoses. The study's results suggest that sex differences in exploration and learning may contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to these disorders. Further research is needed to understand how sex, explore-exploit states, and reward outcomes interact to influence animal choices.

The study's use of computational tools allowed researchers to uncover latent variables that define different decision-making approaches, even in animals with similar correct performance. This approach has the potential to reveal new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying sex differences in decision-making and neuropsychiatric disorders. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences in research on decision-making and neuropsychiatric disorders.

     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the process of endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD), where membrane proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. A crucial step in this process is the movement of hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytosol, often accompanied by hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts. However, the mechanism by which this occurs has remained unclear.

     Using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, scientists have identified the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (Teb-4/MARCH6 in animals) as a retrotranslocase that facilitates membrane protein extraction. The study reveals that a substrate's TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then passively moves into the aqueous phase. In contrast, luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, with their unfolding occurring on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action.

     This research demonstrates how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase, Doa10, cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains. The findings provide new insights into the ERAD process and shed light on the long-standing question of how luminal domains are moved across the membrane during protein extraction. The study's results have implications for our understanding of protein quality control pathways in various organelles, including the ER, Golgi, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, where membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that Hedgehog (Hh) proteins play a crucial role in guiding development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Aberrant Hh protein production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental birth defects and cancer. In Drosophila, Hh signaling proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Drosophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear transcriptional repressors and by activating the full-length Ci or Gli proteins.

     To investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent Hh signaling, researchers used Ci variants expressed at physiological levels in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. The results showed that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology, when supplemented by constitutive Ci repressor. This suggests that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing.

     Furthermore, processing-resistant Ci variants were also significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2, likely acting through binding the CORD domain of Ci, or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing. The study also found that Ci can mediate normal Hh morphogen action in wing discs in the complete absence of regulated processing, provided a constitutive source of Ci repressor was present to suppress ectopic dpp expression in anterior cells.

     The results of this study demonstrate that wing patterning by Hh does not require regulation of the level of either repressor or full-length Ci protein by processing. Animals lacking both Fu kinase and Su(fu) also develop normal wings, although late third instar wing discs do lack anterior En induction. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of Hh signaling and suggest that Hh can act as a morphogen in the absence of regulated Ci processing.

summary
     Biomedical research has identified a crucial role for the RAB23 gene in regulating the development of bones in the skull. Mutations in RAB23 have been linked to Carpenter Syndrome, a condition characterized by abnormalities in bone development, including extra fingers and toes, and premature fusion of skull bones. To understand how RAB23 regulates bone development, researchers generated mice lacking the RAB23 gene and studied their skeletal development.

     The results showed that RAB23-deficient mice exhibited premature fusion of skull bones, similar to humans with Carpenter Syndrome. Further investigation revealed that RAB23 regulates the activity of two key signaling pathways: FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1. The FGF10-pERK1/2 pathway is involved in the proliferation and differentiation of bone cells, while the Hh-GLI1 pathway regulates the development of the mesenchymal stem cell niche.

     The researchers found that RAB23 acts as a negative regulator of these pathways, meaning that it suppresses their activity. In the absence of RAB23, the FGF10-pERK1/2 pathway is overactive, leading to excessive bone cell proliferation and premature fusion of skull bones. Similarly, the Hh-GLI1 pathway is also overactive, leading to an imbalance in the development of the mesenchymal stem cell niche.

     Inhibition of the FGF10-pERK1/2 pathway in RAB23-deficient mice normalized bone cell proliferation and prevented premature fusion of skull bones. Additionally, inhibition of the Hh-GLI1 pathway corrected the imbalance in the mesenchymal stem cell niche. These findings suggest that RAB23 plays a critical role in regulating the development of bones in the skull by coordinating the activity of the FGF10-pERK1/2 and Hh-GLI1 pathways.

     The researchers also found that RAB23 regulates the expression of the GLI1 gene, which is involved in the development of the mesenchymal stem cell niche. RAB23 acts as a negative regulator of GLI1, meaning that it suppresses its expression. In the absence of RAB23, GLI1 is overexpressed, leading to an imbalance in the development of the mesenchymal stem cell niche.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of RAB23 in regulating bone development and highlights the importance of this gene in preventing premature fusion of skull bones. The findings also suggest that RAB23 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating conditions characterized by abnormal bone development.
Scientists have long sought to understand how cells "remember" past events, such as environmental or developmental cues, and maintain gene expression states over time. A key player in this process is the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants. PRC2 modifies chromatin at its targets, and these modifications can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance directs long-term memory of individual gene expression states (cis memory) or if local chromatin states are dictated by diffusible factors (trans memory).

To address this question, researchers studied the Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis plants. They found that one copy of the FLC gene can be repressed while the other is active, and this mixed expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as the plants develop. This suggests that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored locally in the chromatin environment of the gene itself, rather than in the concentrations of diffusible factors.

The researchers exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure. Vernalization is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor FLC. The study used an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FLC expression states at the single-cell level and found that FLC repression is independent of DNA methylation, making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene.

In vernalized plants, FLC expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which FLC is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure. The results demonstrate that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored not in trans, but in cis, meaning that the local chromatin environment of the gene itself instructs its own epigenetic inheritance. This finding has implications for our understanding of how cells maintain gene expression states over time and how epigenetic memory is stored and inherited.
BiP, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70 chaperone, forms oligomers that have a poorly understood structure and functional significance. Using site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking, researchers have probed the architecture of BiP oligomers and found that they consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another. This interaction attenuates the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP.

Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers, as well as slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, indicating that the oligomers are relatively inert. This suggests that equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale.

BiP oligomerization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell, and given that oligomerization inactivates participating BiP protomers, the oligomeric form is a relatively inactive storage form of the chaperone that is accessible on a short timescale. The findings are consistent with a model where competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions.

The researchers propose that the affinity of Hsp70 proteins for their substrates is governed by J-protein driven non-equilibrium mechanisms, which could account for BiP favoring itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients as ER calcium levels decline. This would shift the equilibrium between unfolded proteins and active chaperones in favor of the former. The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and BiP oligomerization appears to break down in the context of ER calcium depletion, which is both a strong inducer of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and promotes rapid oligomerization of BiP.

The study suggests that enhanced production of unfolded proteins rapidly draws on the pool of inactive, oligomeric BiP to service its growing clientele. Reports of enhanced presence of oligomers in longer-term stressed cells may have reflected the partitioning of excess chaperone produced during the activated UPR, but made redundant following resolution of the insult. The relationship between unfolded protein load and the oligomeric state of Hsp70 chaperones is confounded by powerful feedback that dominates the unfolded protein responses and couples chaperone production to the levels of unfolded protein stress.

     Scientists have determined the near-atomic structure of a flexible filamentous plant virus called Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) using a technique called electron cryomicroscopy. PepMV is a representative of the genus Potexvirus, which includes economically important plant pathogens. The structure of PepMV reveals that its coat protein (CP) is made up of several hundred copies arranged in a helical fashion, protecting a single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) genome.

     The researchers found that the CP of PepMV has a similar structure to the nucleoproteins (NPs) of the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented ssRNA genome. This similarity suggests that there may have been gene transfer between eukaryotic viruses with positive-sense ssRNA and those with negative-sense ssRNA. The main difference between the CP of PepMV and the NP of Phlebovirus is in their C-terminal extensions, which determine the characteristics of their multimeric assemblies.

     The C-terminal extensions of the CP of PepMV form a flexuous, helical rod, while those of the NP of Phlebovirus form a loose ribonucleoprotein (RNP). The RNPs of Phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome and are protected by an envelope with inserted glycoproteins that form an icosahedral shell.

     Flexible filamentous viruses, including PepMV, are non-enveloped and rod-shaped, containing hundreds of copies of the CP arranged in a helical fashion to protect the ssRNA genome. The high-resolution structures of these viruses have only been determined for representatives of the genus Potexvirus, including PepMV, PapMV, and BaMV. It is unclear whether other families of flexuous filamentous viruses, such as Betaflexiviridae, Closteroviridae, and Potyviridae, have a similar fold in their CPs.

     The discovery of structural homology between the CP of PepMV and the NP of Phlebovirus has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and diversity of viruses. It suggests that there may have been gene transfer between eukaryotic viruses with positive-sense ssRNA and those with negative-sense ssRNA, and highlights the importance of further research into the relationships between different virus families.
Scientists have developed a new method, called SiteLoc, to precisely locate the binding sites of antibodies on the surface of cells. This is important because the location of an antibody's binding site can determine the outcome of an immune response. Current techniques for identifying binding sites are time-consuming, expensive, and not well-suited for high-throughput analysis.

The new method uses topological image averaging to achieve nanometer-scale resolution, which is the ability to measure distances as small as one billionth of a meter. This is done by calculating the average distance between a bound ligand (such as an antibody) and a reference surface on the cell. The method can be applied to both spherical and non-spherical cell surfaces, which is a significant improvement over existing techniques that are only suitable for identical or spherical particles.

SiteLoc uses high-resolution images to determine the location of binding sites with nanometer-scale precision. The method involves reducing the dimensionality of the surface data within an image plane, allowing for accurate measurements of molecular heights on the cell surface. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of SiteLoc by using it to locate the binding site of an antibody on the surface of bacteria.

The results show that SiteLoc can accurately estimate molecular heights on both spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces. The method was also able to accurately locate the binding site of a non-specific monoclonal IgG antibody on the surface of bacteria. The binding site of this antibody was previously known to be located at the S region of the M protein, and SiteLoc was able to confirm this location.

Overall, the SiteLoc method provides a fast and efficient way to screen epitope locations on the surface of cells, which can be useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. The method has the potential to improve our understanding of immune responses and facilitate the development of new treatments.
Summary
     The regulation of systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is a complex process involving multiple factors, including peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds. One key aspect of this regulation is the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance, particularly in response to hypoxia. Hypoxia, or low oxygen levels, triggers a response in individual tissues, which in turn affects systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation. This study investigates the role of peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin, a large vascular bed, in modulating cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice.

     The researchers found that the skin's response to hypoxia, mediated by the HIF (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor) transcription factors, plays a crucial role in influencing cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. The study demonstrates that peripheral tissues, such as the skin, can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia. To investigate this further, the researchers analyzed the effect of losing hypoxia-responsive genes in the skin on the cardiovascular response to hypoxia.

     The results show that mice lacking HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2, and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis exhibit significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures compared to littermate control animals. The study also reveals that keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression affects the immediate, acute, and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. The researchers propose a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin, which suggests that hypoxia leads to an initial increase in vascular diameter and perfusion, followed by a reduction of intracellular L-arginine.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the dynamic role of oxygen sensing in peripheral tissues, such as the skin, in modulating cardiovascular response to hypoxia. The results demonstrate that peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin play a critical role in systemic cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia, and highlight the importance of considering peripheral tissues in the regulation of cardiovascular function.
Scientists have developed a new method for mapping the connections between individual neurons in the brain with high precision. This method uses a technique called optogenetics, which involves using light to activate specific neurons and observe their responses. The researchers used a protein called channelrhodopsin (ChR2) that is sensitive to light and can generate electrical signals in neurons when activated. By combining ChR2 with a technique called temporal focusing, which expands the light beam in the imaging plane, the researchers were able to selectively activate individual neurons and observe their responses with high accuracy.

The new method allows researchers to determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections between individual neurons with single-neuron resolution. This is a significant improvement over previous methods, which often left an indeterminate region of the circuit map coinciding with the dendritic arbors of the recorded neuron. The new method also reduces the risk of unintended activation of fibers of passage or local axonal boutons, which can respond to temporal focusing of two-photon excitation.

To achieve this level of precision, the researchers restricted ChR2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons, rather than allowing it to be expressed throughout the dendritic and axon terminal fields. This allowed them to selectively activate individual neurons and observe their responses without generating confounding light-induced electrical responses.

The synaptic organization of individual neurons into circuits is the physiological basis for the interpretation of sensory input and production of behavioral responses. Understanding the precise patterns of connectivity among the distinct types of neurons that comprise neural circuits is critical for elucidating circuit function. The new method developed by the researchers provides a powerful tool for mapping functional connectivity with single-cell resolution, which is essential for advancing our understanding of neural circuits and their role in behavior. This method has the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience and provide new insights into the workings of the brain.
Summary
     The interaction of transcription factors (TFs) on eukaryotic genomes is a complex process that has been the subject of ongoing debate. Recent single-molecule data on the TFs Sox2 and Oct4 suggested an ordered assembly model, where Sox2 assists Oct4 in binding to DNA. However, a rigorous biophysical analysis of the data reveals that the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4 is actually characterized by negative reciprocity. This means that the expression of Sox2 increases Oct4's genomic binding, while the expression of Oct4 decreases Sox2's binding.

     The negative reciprocity between Sox2 and Oct4 can arise from two possible mechanisms: energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. The genomic-diversity model, which assumes that Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other across the genome, can account for the single-molecule data. This finding is unexpected and suggests that TFs like Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit different cooperativities at different loci.

     The implications of this finding are significant, as it highlights the complexity of TF interactions on DNA. Single-molecule methods, such as those used by Chen et al., offer novel detection capabilities for unraveling these mechanisms. The variation in sign of cooperativity across the genome has important ramifications, suggesting that single-molecule data can provide more information than previously expected. In fact, a single number, Γ=-0.22, can indicate that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across genomic loci in vivo.

     The genomic-diversity model suggests that either energy expenditure maintains loci at which Sox2 and Oct4 bind away from thermodynamic equilibrium or there is mixed cooperativity across the genome, with Sox2 and Oct4 helping each other through positive cooperativity at some loci and hindering each other through negative cooperativity at other loci. Further studies are needed to address the implications of this finding and to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that detecting pathogens and mounting an immune response is crucial for animal health, but these responses come at a high metabolic cost. To avoid pathogens before infection may be advantageous. Bacterial endotoxins, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are important immune system infection cues, but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect them prior to infection. This study investigated whether Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) possess a sensory mechanism to detect LPS.

     The study found that Drosophila melanogaster display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg-laying assays. The expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells was found to be necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. These findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as a conserved molecular mechanism.

     The study showed that LPS is avoided during feeding and oviposition, and that dTrpA1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. These data indicate that a TRPA1-dependent mechanism of avoidance of LPS may serve flies to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. The study also found that control animals, but not dTrpA1-/- mutants, preferred laying eggs on control food, rather than on food contaminated with LPS.

     The study suggests that TRPA1 mediates gustatory avoidance of LPS in flies. Blocking neurotransmission in these neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin (TNT) abolished avoidance of LPS, indicating that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism. The findings demonstrate that fruit flies possess a gustatory mechanism underlying the detection and avoidance of LPS. The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals. The fact that this sensory mechanism exploits dTRPA1 suggests a broadly conserved principle whereby these channels play a crucial role in LPS detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the particular sensory modality involved.
summary
     The generation of naïve T lymphocytes is crucial for immune function, but the mechanisms governing their maturation are not yet fully understood. Researchers have identified a mouse mutant, bloto, which harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335. Mice with this mutation exhibit a deficiency in naïve T cells due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335bloto are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation, or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation.

     The study reveals a novel role for Zfp335 as an essential regulator of T cell maturation. By analyzing mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a C2H2 zinc finger of Zfp335, researchers show a selective defect in the accumulation of naïve T cells resulting from a maturation block in SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants. Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. A set of Zfp335 target genes in thymocytes is identified, and evidence is presented that decreased Zfp335 occupancy at a subset of these targets alters gene expression in mutant thymocytes. The findings provide evidence that Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of a transcriptional program required for T cell maturation.

     Ankle2 is identified as a functional target gene of Zfp335, and its dysregulation by Zfp335R1092W contributes to the maturation defect in blt/blt T cells. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis shows reduced Ankle2 transcript levels in thymocyte and naïve T cell populations sorted from blt/blt mice. Western blot analysis confirms reduced Ankle2 protein levels in mutant thymocytes. The study demonstrates that the maturation defect in blt/blt mice is independent of thymic selection or effects on proliferation, but is associated with reduced viability. Restoring Ankle2 expression partially rescues T cell maturation, indicating its functional relevance to the T cell maturation defect in blt/blt mice.
(summary)
     Biologists have long assumed that the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) in a cell directly correlates with the amount of protein produced. However, research has shown that this is not always the case, and other factors can influence protein production. A new study has identified a previously unknown factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, which plays a significant role in controlling protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea.

     The study found that mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, which refers to the ability of mRNA to avoid interacting with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), is a critical factor in determining protein abundance. The researchers generated synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions and demonstrated that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. This suggests that taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account can enable precise modulation of protein abundance.

     The study analyzed data from 97% of species and found a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls. By generating variant GFP mRNAs that differ in their potential to interact with core ncRNAs, the researchers demonstrated that GFP expression levels can be both predicted and controlled. The results indicate that there is strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes.

     The study also found that measuring only extrinsic avoidance, using shuffled mRNAs as negative controls, revealed that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in most prokaryotic phyla. The results clearly establish a signature of selection that acts to minimize stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions. However, the complete avoidance of stochastic interactions is combinatorially unlikely, suggesting a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression.

     The study's findings suggest that crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs can impact protein expression levels, and that taking crosstalk into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled. The researchers predict that mRNAs with low avoidance values will produce fewer proteins for each mRNA transcript than those with high avoidance. A meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data supports this prediction, indicating that mRNA:ncRNA avoidance is at least as good an explanation of variation in protein abundance as codon usage and internal mRNA secondary structure.
summary
     Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper and lower motor neurons (MN) and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). A key pathological event in ALS is the denervation of NMJs, which occurs prior to symptom onset and is observed in both patients and animal models of the disease. However, the underlying mechanisms of NMJ denervation in ALS remain unclear.

     Researchers used in vivo imaging to study the dynamics of NMJ denervation in a mouse model of ALS (SOD1G37R mice) over a three-month period. They found that single motor-units (MUs) are dismantled asynchronously, with the dismantling of axonal branches accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting and synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. This suggests that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation, rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration.

     The study revealed that denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons. Distal branches were found to be more susceptible to denervation. These findings highlight a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration, which could be therapeutically exploited in ALS.

     The results also suggest that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation, as the rescue of neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation. Local alterations of synaptic function and molecular signaling occur early at the NMJ in ALS, and the study's findings support the "dying-back hypothesis," which proposes that local branch-specific degeneration contributes to NMJ denervation.

     The study's use of longitudinal repeated in vivo imaging of single motor neuron axonal arbors and their NMJs provides new insights into the time course and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression. The findings have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to target NMJ denervation in ALS.

     ISG15 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the innate immune response against viral infections. Recent research has shown that ISG15 can also counteract bacterial infections, specifically Listeria monocytogenes. The study found that ISG15 expression is dramatically induced in non-phagocytic cells upon Listeria infection, and this induction is not dependent on type I interferon. Instead, the induction of ISG15 is mediated by the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7.

     The researchers used stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC) to identify proteins that are modified by ISG15 during Listeria infection. They found that ISG15 modification of ER and Golgi proteins leads to increased secretion of cytokines that counteract infection. This suggests that ISG15 plays a key role in restricting Listeria infection by modulating the host cell's response to the pathogen.

     The study demonstrated that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection both in vitro and in vivo. The researchers also found that ISG15's role in host defense against Listeria requires ISGylation, a process by which ISG15 is covalently linked to target proteins. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which ISG15 counteracts bacterial infections and highlight the importance of ISG15 as a key component of the innate immune response.

     The study's results show that ISG15 can be induced by Listeria in an interferon-independent manner in human non-phagocytic cells. The researchers used a viral protein, B18R, to block signaling from the interferon receptor and confirmed that ISG15 induction is not dependent on type I interferon. The study's findings suggest that ISG15 plays a previously uncharacterized role in restricting Listeria infection and reinforce the view that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which ISG15 counteracts bacterial infections and highlights the importance of ISG15 in host defense against pathogens.
Summary
     Scientists have developed a new software tool called DeepFRET to analyze data from single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments. smFRET is a technique used to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, analyzing the large amounts of data generated by smFRET experiments can be time-consuming and subjective.

     DeepFRET uses deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to automate the analysis of smFRET data. The software takes raw microscope images as input and outputs detailed information about the behavior of biomolecules. The only human intervention required is setting a quality threshold for the data. DeepFRET has been shown to accurately classify smFRET data with an accuracy of over 95%, outperforming human operators and other commonly used methods.

     The software is based on a pre-trained neural network that can recognize patterns in the data and learn useful features directly from the raw input. This allows DeepFRET to operate without extensive data preprocessing or empirically defined rules, making it a reproducible and less opinionated evaluation of single-molecule data. Additionally, DeepFRET is significantly faster than human annotation for large single-molecule datasets.

     The developers of DeepFRET have made the software available as a free-to-use standalone executable for both Windows and Mac users. This allows end-users with limited programming skills to easily operate the software. DeepFRET has the potential to contribute to benchmarking smFRET for dynamic structural biology and enable new fully automated analysis methodologies related to biomolecular recognition, protein folding, and dynamics.

     The software has been tested on real data and has demonstrated its capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics. The developers expect DeepFRET to be a paradigm shift in the field of single-molecule studies, enabling new fully automated analysis methodologies and increasing the breadth and impact of structural biology.
Summary
     The Polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1) plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, is a Polycomb-group protein that associates with PRC1. Research has shown that SCML2A, an isoform of SCML2 tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and directly enforces repression of certain Polycomb target genes.

     SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). The targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes, and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment.

     The study also found that SCML2 appears to enforce repression directly, independent of PRC1 recruitment, at a subset of genes. The identification of SCML2 as a PcG protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Polycomb targets sheds new light on the interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation. The results suggest that RNA binding plays a role in SCML2 function, as it is required for its localization to chromatin.

     The study proposes a model in which the RBR contributes to the localization of SCML2A to chromatin, where it interacts with PRC1 and creates a chromatin environment that is refractory to transcription. The RBR is required to recruit or stabilize SCML2 on chromatin, and SCML2A is then retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1. The study concludes that SCML2 is recruited to a subset of target genes through a process that requires its RNA-binding activity and that the presence of mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes a partial release of BMI1 and PRC1 from chromatin.
summary
     Biologists have long understood that the regulation of translating ribosomes is a crucial component of the gene expression control network. In the bacterium Escherichia coli, the C-terminal arrest sequence of the SecM protein plays a significant role in regulating the SecA-dependent secretion pathway by causing ribosome stalling. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this stalling process has remained unclear at the atomic level.

     To address this knowledge gap, researchers used a single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) technique to analyze the structures of SecM-stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCs) at near-atomic resolution. Their analysis revealed two distinct mechanisms of stalling at different elongation steps of the translation cycle. The first mechanism involves the inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), which prevents the formation of a peptide bond with the incoming prolyl-tRNA. The second mechanism involves the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site, which inhibits the full-scale translocation of the tRNA.

     The researchers found that the interactions between SecM and the ribosome's exit tunnel induce conformational changes in the PTC, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps. Specifically, the position of the tRNA-nascent peptide linkage of SecM-tRNA is similar to that seen in the structure of the ribosome with an active PTC. This suggests an alternative mechanism of SecM-induced stalling, where the PTC is locked in an inactive state, preventing the stable binding and accommodation of the incoming A-site tRNA.

     These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SecM-dependent translational stalling and demonstrate how regulatory peptides can control the translation cycle through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the ribosome's functional center. The results also shed light on the complex interactions between SecM and the ribosome, highlighting the importance of conformational changes in the PTC for translation regulation. Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the intricate mechanisms underlying gene expression control in bacteria.
Using a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope, researchers have made the first measurements of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes. The study involved imaging cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were calculated in both visual angle and linear retinal units. The results show that the foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length.

The study found that despite retinal stretching, myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes. This suggests that myopes may have better visual acuity due to a higher concentration of cones in the foveal region. The findings contradict reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes, which have been attributed to increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression.

Previous studies have implicated retinal stretching as a possible cause of myopic visual deficits, but the structural changes at the foveal center during myopic progression were not well understood. The current study aimed to investigate how eye length affects cone density at and near the foveal center. The researchers used adaptive optics to image the foveal photoreceptor mosaic, which offers the highest contrast en face images of the foveal photoreceptor mosaic ever recorded in vivo.

The study found that if the enlargement of the retinal image exactly matched the stretching of the cone mosaic, eyes of different lengths would sample the visual field similarly. However, the results show that this is not the case, and myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes. This suggests that myopes may have better visual acuity due to a higher concentration of cones in the foveal region, contradicting previous reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the relationship between eye length and visual acuity. The results suggest that myopes may have an advantage in terms of visual acuity due to a higher concentration of cones in the foveal region, despite retinal stretching. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between eye length and visual acuity, but the current study provides new insights into the structural changes at the foveal center during myopic progression.

Summary
     The slow delayed rectifier current (IKs) plays a crucial role in stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration in the heart. This current is mediated by the tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel KCNQ1 and its β-subunit KCNE1. However, the stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been a subject of controversy, with some studies suggesting a strict 2:4 ratio and others proposing a variable ratio up to 4:4.

     To clarify this issue, researchers created fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one, two, or four KCNQ1 subunits, mimicking 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries, respectively. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed that fusion proteins with two or four KCNQ1 subunits (EQQ and EQQQQ) exhibited increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to the fusion protein with one KCNQ1 subunit (EQ). The addition of KCNE1 abolished these differences, indicating that KCNE1 is essential for the observed effects.

     Furthermore, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, the researchers found that the crosslinking rates of EQQQQ and EQQ were progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, suggesting that there is no intrinsic mechanism limiting the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex. This finding supports the idea that the stoichiometry between KCNQ1 and KCNE1 can be regulated based on availability, allowing for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.

     The results of this study provide evidence for a 4:4 stoichiometry of KCNE1:KCNQ1 and highlight the flexibility in KCNQ1's β-subunit association, both in number and type, which can modulate repolarization in the heart. This flexibility allows for changes in expression to alter the distribution of channel composition, shifting the overall activation kinetics of the current. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the IKs channel complex and its role in cardiac function and disease.

     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the underlying processes of tissue regeneration, particularly in response to injury. A recent study on zebrafish fin fold regeneration has shed light on the role of interleukin-1 beta (Il1b) in this process. The study found that Il1b, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is expressed by epithelial cells in response to tissue injury and plays a crucial role in initiating the inflammatory response. However, prolonged expression of Il1b leads to apoptosis of regenerative cells, highlighting the double-edged sword nature of Il1b signaling in tissue regeneration.

     Further investigation revealed that macrophages, a type of immune cell, are responsible for attenuating Il1b expression and resolving inflammation during tissue regeneration. The study demonstrated that macrophages play a critical role in tuning the level of Il1b expression and inflammation, which is necessary for the progression of tissue regeneration. In fact, genetic ablation of macrophages in adult zebrafish was shown to affect fin ray patterning and fin growth, underscoring the importance of macrophages in tissue regeneration.

     The study also found that Il1b signaling is essential for the activation of regeneration-induced genes, which are necessary for tissue regeneration. This suggests that a proper level of Il1b expression and inflammatory response, tuned by macrophages, is necessary for the progression of tissue regeneration. In contrast, excessive Il1b signaling and inflammation can impair tissue regeneration, leading to apoptosis of regenerative cells.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex interplay between Il1b signaling, inflammation, and tissue regeneration. The study highlights the critical role of macrophages in regulating the level of Il1b expression and inflammation, and underscores the importance of a balanced inflammatory response in tissue regeneration. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of tissue regeneration and may inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for tissue repair and regeneration.

     The study investigated the relationship between protein mobility and surface properties in the cytoplasm of three bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii. The researchers used surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) to determine their translational diffusion coefficients (D) in the cytoplasm of these bacteria. The results showed that the diffusion coefficient of proteins in E. coli depends on their net charge and the distribution of charge over the protein surface, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones.

In contrast, the slowdown in diffusion with increasing positive surface charge was less pronounced in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The study found that the decrease in diffusion coefficient is mainly caused by the binding of positive proteins to ribosomes, with dissociation constants (KD) on the order of micromolar. This suggests that non-selective interactions between proteins and ribosomes can have a significant impact on protein mobility.

The researchers also found that the diffusion coefficients of proteins in the cytoplasm of E. coli become even slower when cells are exposed to an osmotic upshift. In addition, positive proteins not only diffuse slowly but their binding to ribosomes might also inhibit protein synthesis by affecting the assembly or activity of ribosomes. The study suggests that ribosome surface properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome.

To determine the consequences of these findings, the researchers analyzed the proteomes of E. coli, L. lactis, and Hfx. volcanii, as well as four endosymbiotic bacteria. They determined how a protein will diffuse in light of the composition of the proteome, taking into account both the net charges and abundances of all proteome components. The study also investigated how ribosomes affect the diffusion of proteome constituents, considering the net charge of the proteins.

The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the functioning of prokaryotic cells, particularly in the context of endosymbiotic relationships. The study highlights the importance of considering the interactions between proteins and ribosomes in the cytoplasm, and how these interactions can limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. The results also suggest that non-selective interactions between proteins and ribosomes can have a significant impact on protein mobility and protein synthesis.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain animals, such as planarians, to regenerate lost body parts. However, the mechanisms that trigger this regenerative process are not yet fully understood. A recent study has shed light on this mystery by identifying a key protein called Smed-follistatin, which plays a crucial role in initiating regeneration in planarians.

The researchers found that Smed-follistatin is required for planarians to respond to injuries that result in the absence of tissue, but not for normal tissue turnover. They also discovered that two other proteins, Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2, are necessary for Smed-follistatin to function properly. Furthermore, the study showed that Smed-follistatin is expressed at higher levels in response to injuries that cause tissue absence, suggesting that it is specifically activated in response to these types of wounds.

The researchers propose that Smed-follistatin inhibits the activity of Smed-activin proteins, which are part of the TGF-β signaling pathway. This inhibition is thought to trigger the regenerative response in planarians. The study also found that Smed-follistatin is wound-induced, meaning that it is produced in response to injury, and that its expression persists at high levels for a longer period after a major injury compared to a simple injury.

The discovery of Smed-follistatin and its role in regeneration has important implications for our understanding of regenerative mechanisms across the animal kingdom. Regeneration is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple cellular and molecular pathways. The identification of Smed-follistatin as a key player in this process provides new insights into how animals distinguish between different types of injuries and regulate distinct wound response programs.

The study suggests that Smed-follistatin allows planarians to initiate a regenerative response specifically in response to injuries involving tissue absence. This is in contrast to injuries that do not result in tissue loss, which do not trigger a regenerative response. The researchers propose that wound-induced expression of Smed-follistatin is a critical mechanism for triggering regeneration in planarians.

Overall, the discovery of Smed-follistatin and its role in regeneration provides a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying this complex process. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the role of Smed-follistatin in regeneration and to explore its potential applications in regenerative medicine.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a unique mutation signature in tumors with a deficiency in mismatch repair (MMR), a process that corrects errors in DNA replication. Using whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing, they found that MMR-deficient tumors exhibit a distinct pattern of mutations, characterized by the accumulation of indel mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats, known as microsatellite instability (MSI). This mutation signature is distinct from other tumor genomes but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA, suggesting that a significant portion of human genetic variation arises from mutations that escape MMR.

     The researchers also identified a set of recurrent indels that can be used to detect MSI, which is a hallmark of MMR-deficient tumors. They developed a novel marker set that can detect MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Furthermore, they found that recurrent indels are enriched for the "DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination" pathway, indicating that MMR-deficient tumors have reduced ability to repair DNA double-strand breaks.

     As a result, MMR-deficient tumors are sensitive to DNA double-strand break inducers, making them a potential target for therapy. The researchers demonstrated that MMR-deficient tumor cultures are sensitive to DNA double-strand break inducers in a dose-dependent manner. This finding has significant implications for the treatment of MMR-deficient tumors, which are often resistant to standard chemotherapy.

     The study used whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to analyze 33 tumor-normal pairs, of which 25 were MMR-deficient. The results showed that MMR-deficient tumors contain a significantly higher number of somatic mutations, with an average of 2015 mutations per tumor, compared to 39 in MMR-proficient tumors. The validation rates for substitutions and indels were 87% and 86%, respectively. The study provides new insights into the molecular characteristics of MMR-deficient tumors and identifies potential therapeutic targets for these tumors.
Summary
     Scientists have developed an improved version of a tool called Magnets, which allows for precise control over biological processes in living cells using light. Magnets are small protein modules derived from the Vivid photoreceptor found in the fungus Neurospora crassa. They consist of two complementary components, nMag (negative Magnet) and pMag (positive Magnet), which require simultaneous photoactivation to interact and form a dimer.

     The original Magnets pair has limitations, including the need for concatemerization (a process where multiple copies of the same protein are linked together) and preincubation at a low temperature (28°C) to function efficiently. To overcome these limitations, researchers engineered an optimized Magnets pair, called eMags, which do not require concatemerization or low-temperature preincubation.

     The eMags were tested in various applications, including recruiting proteins to subcellular organelles, inducing organelle contacts, and reconstituting a protein complex involved in lipid transport between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. The results showed that eMags are a highly effective tool for optogenetically manipulating physiological processes in mammalian cells.

     The eMags have several advantages over the original Magnets pair, including greater thermal stability, higher dimerization efficiency, and faster association and dissociation kinetics. The researchers used a robust screen to identify the optimal placement of charge-complementing amino acids in the Vivid dimer interface to achieve these improvements. The eMags are well-suited for optogenetic modulation of small volumes and subcellular organelles due to their rapid association and dissociation kinetics and low background activation.

     The eMags have the potential to be used in a variety of applications, including the study of cellular processes and the development of new therapeutic strategies. They offer a powerful tool for precise control over biological processes in living cells, allowing researchers to manipulate specific proteins and organelles with high spatiotemporal resolution.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that ribosome stalling during translation can lead to neurodegeneration, but the underlying signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes were unknown. To investigate these pathways, scientists analyzed the brains of C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNAArgUCU tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. The results revealed increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ser51) prior to neurodegeneration in these mice. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Furthermore, the ISR was found to attenuate neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress.

     The study used unique mouse models with the Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mutation to assess the signaling events triggered by ribosome stalling. The results showed that GCN2 is activated in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mutant brain in a tRNA-deacyl-independent manner prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. Activation of this kinase results in eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. Genetic studies demonstrated that GCN2 activation functions to attenuate neurodegeneration in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain. These results suggest that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation.

     Failure to resolve stalled elongation complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration of these cells, but the signaling pathways evoked by these complexes are unknown. The study shows that GCN2 activates the integrated stress response in the brain of mice with stalled ribosomes, demonstrating an important feedback loop between elongation defects, in particular ribosome stalling, and translation initiation. In the hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/-; Gcn2-/- mice, degeneration of CA1 pyramidal cells was observed, suggesting the eIF2α/ATF4 pathway is vital for survival of these neurons during ribosome stalling. ATF4 activation also occurs in the brains of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice in which the n-Tr20 is entirely deleted and thus no unprocessed tRNA is produced. These results raise the possibility that ribosome stalling may also contribute to GCN2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation, in which like B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- neurons, lower levels of acylated tRNA are present. The exact mechanism for GCN2 activation by ribosome stalling remains unclear.
Over the past century, adult human height has undergone significant changes across the world's countries, with varying degrees of increase and stability. A comprehensive analysis of 1472 population-based studies, involving over 18.6 million participants, was conducted to estimate mean height for individuals born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The study found that being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, higher education, and earnings.

The largest gains in adult height over the past century were observed in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest individuals over the past 100 years were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, with an average height of 182.5 cm, while the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896, with an average height of 140.3 cm.

The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was approximately 19 cm for men and 20 cm for women a century ago, and has remained relatively stable for women but increased for men over the past century. The study also found that the ranking of countries in terms of adult height has undergone significant changes, with some countries experiencing substantial increases in height while others have shown little change.

Notably, the largest gains in height since the 1896 birth cohort were observed in South Korean women and Iranian men, who surpassed the heights of women in Norway, Iceland, the USA, and American Samoa. In contrast, the shortest women were found in El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Japan. The tallest populations a century ago lived in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and some Pacific islands, while the shortest populations were found in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

The study's findings highlight the significant variations in adult height across the world's countries over the past century, with no indication of convergence across countries. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations has remained relatively stable for women but increased for men, despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries in terms of adult height.

Summary
     Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus, hepatitis D virus (HDV), remain significant public health concerns due to their severe impact on individuals coinfected with both viruses. The entry of both viruses into host cells is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein. However, the identity of the receptor(s) responsible for binding to this domain has remained unknown.

     Researchers used near-zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification to identify the receptor-binding region of pre-S1 and found that it specifically interacts with sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections.

     Further analysis revealed that replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart restored its ability to support both viral infections. This suggests that residues between 157 and 165 of NTCP are crucial for binding to the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the L protein of HBV and critically contribute to NTCP-mediated HBV and HDV infections.

     These findings demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for both HBV and HDV. The pre-S1 domain of the L protein is a key determinant for entry of both viruses and is believed to mediate viral interaction with the cellular receptor(s) on hepatocytes. The discovery of NTCP as a receptor for HBV and HDV provides new insights into the mechanisms of viral entry and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HBV and HDV infections.
summary
     Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to an infection, leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. Memory CD8 T cells provide long-term immunity by rapidly recognizing and killing infected cells and producing cytokines to coordinate the immune response. However, sepsis can impair the function of these cells, making individuals more susceptible to re-infection.

     Researchers investigated the effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells in patients and mice. They found that central memory CD8 T cells, a subset of memory CD8 T cells, proliferate more in septic patients and mice compared to healthy individuals. This increased proliferation leads to changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment and altered tissue localization. The researchers also observed that memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility, indicating long-lasting changes in the cells.

     The sepsis-induced changes in the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape result in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control infections. Specifically, the researchers found that memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors have a reduced ability to undergo T cell receptor-dependent adhesion and immunologic synapse formation, which is essential for effective immune responses. These findings suggest that sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function, and localization, potentially changing the host's capacity to respond to re-infection.

     The study demonstrates that pre-existing memory CD8 T cells numerically recover with time after sepsis, potentially due to increased proliferation in response to the sepsis-induced lymphopenic environment. However, this recovery is accompanied by changes in the composition and localization of pre-existing memory CD8 T cells, leading to an over-representation of central memory CD8 T cells. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the long-term consequences of sepsis on the immune system and highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced changes in memory CD8 T cells.
summary
     The APOBEC3A (A3A) enzyme is a potent inhibitor of Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition in human cells. L1 retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes, and A3A has been shown to inhibit this process in cultured cell assays. However, the molecular mechanism by which A3A inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained unclear. A3A catalyzes the deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides (C-to-U) in single-strand DNA substrates, but previous studies failed to detect deamination events in L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A.

     To elucidate the mechanism of A3A-mediated inhibition of L1 retrotransposition, researchers employed an in vitro assay (L1 Element Amplification Protocol or LEAP) that recapitulates the first strand cDNA synthesis step of the L1 integration. The results showed that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. This deamination leads to inexact TSDs (target site duplications) in the post-integration site.

     The researchers further demonstrated that engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells that co-express A3A and the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein (UGI) contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events. These data indicate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration.

     Previous studies had shown that over-expression of wild-type APOBEC3A cytidine deaminase protein (A3A) can potently inhibit L1 retrotransposition in cultured human cells, but deamination events were not detected in L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A. The degradation of deaminated retrotransposition intermediates could reduce L1 retrotransposition levels in cultured cell assays and eliminate evidence of A3A-mediated deamination events in the resultant retrotransposed L1 sequences. This scenario could explain why previous studies failed to detect A3A-mediated deamination events in engineered L1 retrotransposition events.

     The findings of this study provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition. The results demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration, leading to inexact TSDs in the post-integration site.
summary
     The study investigated the role of the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity. The researchers found that mice lacking Rem2 (Rem2-/-) failed to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, Rem2 was shown to regulate intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. These findings demonstrate that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.

     The study suggests that Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity to preserve proper circuit function. The results raise the possibility that Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling. To gain more insight into the circuit mechanisms underlying the observed ocular dominance plasticity deficits of Rem2-/- mice, the researchers examined adult ocular dominance plasticity.

     The study provides an important step forward in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function. Given that Rem2 expression is acutely regulated by visual experience, the researchers sought to determine if Rem2 plays a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation by investigating ocular dominance plasticity. The activity-regulated Ras-like GTPase Rem2 is an excellent candidate to link the activity of a neural circuit with functional plasticity. Rem2 is a member of the Rad/Rem/Rem2/Gem/Kir (RGK) protein family, a Ras-related subfamily of small GTPases, whose expression and function are regulated by neuronal activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels.

     The article presents an analysis of the physical limits to magnetogenetics, a field that aims to make cells responsive to magnetic fields for controlling their activity. Recent studies have reported promising results, including the identification of a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals and the magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein. However, the article argues that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, as the forces or torques produced by magnetic fields are too small to have the desired effects on molecular orientation or membrane channels. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is also found to limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.

     The article suggests that if the reported phenomena do occur, they must rely on entirely different mechanisms. The proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields, are unlikely to be successful. One study reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane, but the experimental results are limited and hard to interpret.

     The article also discusses the biophysical basis for magnetosensation, the ability of organisms to sense the Earth's magnetic field for navigation. Two competing proposals have been put forward: one suggests that magnetosensation relies on a magnetite mechanism, while the other proposes that the magnetic field acts on single molecules in biochemical reactions. The article highlights the need for a deeper understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying magnetosensation and magnetogenetics.

     The article concludes that the paramagnetic nature of protein complexes seriously limits their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The forces or torques produced by magnetic fields are too small by many orders of magnitude to have the desired effects on molecular orientation or membrane channels. As a result, the proposed routes to magnetogenetics have no chance of success, barring dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter. The article emphasizes the need for a more fundamental understanding of the biophysical mechanisms underlying magnetosensation and magnetogenetics.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how stem cells switch between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence, a state of dormancy. Drosophila neural progenitors, also known as neuroblasts, have been a valuable model system for studying self-renewal and differentiation. However, the mechanisms governing quiescence in these cells have remained poorly understood. A recent study has shed light on this process by investigating the role of the Prospero differentiation factor in neuroblast quiescence.

     The study found that when neuroblasts enter quiescence, the Prospero differentiation factor is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus at low levels. This pulse of Prospero precedes the establishment of a unique molecular profile characterized by the absence of most progenitor and differentiation markers. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, while a pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence.

     The researchers used Drosophila neuroblasts as a model system to investigate the role of Prospero in quiescence. They found that nearly all neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hours after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers by 24 hours. Additionally, they showed that precocious low-level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of neuroblast quiescence.

     The study also explored the relationship between Prospero levels and neuroblast quiescence. They found that the pulse of nuclear Prospero precisely matched the timing of neuroblast quiescence, occurring earlier in mutants with advanced quiescence and later in mutants with delayed quiescence. This suggests a functional relationship between Prospero levels and neuroblast quiescence.

     The researchers propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms governing neuroblast quiescence and highlights the importance of Prospero in regulating this process. The findings have implications for our understanding of stem cell biology and may inform the development of stem cell-based therapeutics.
Scientists have developed a new method to study the process of HIV-1 capsid uncoating, which is essential for the release of the viral genetic material into the host cell. Using single-particle fluorescence microscopy, researchers were able to observe the uncoating kinetics of individual HIV capsids in real-time. The study found that the opening of the first defect in the capsid lattice is the rate-limiting step in the uncoating process, followed by a rapid and catastrophic collapse of the capsid.

The researchers also investigated the effects of different capsid-binding molecules on the uncoating process. They found that the inhibitor PF74 accelerates the opening of the capsid but stabilizes the remaining lattice, while a polyanion that binds to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice delays the initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. These findings suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently, and the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators determines the overall uncoating kinetics.

The study used a novel in vitro single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay to follow the uncoating kinetics of hundreds of individual HIV capsids in a single experiment. This approach allowed the researchers to resolve intermediates in the disassembly pathway that are averaged out in traditional ensemble assays. The results showed that the integrity and stability of capsids in a population are highly heterogeneous, with the majority containing defects and/or uncoating immediately after removal of the viral membrane.

In the absence of capsid binders, uncoating is an all-or-none process that proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created. The study also demonstrated that the half-life of the HIV capsid is sufficiently long to use PFO-permeabilized viral particles as a platform to quantify the binding of labeled proteins to authentic viral capsids at the single-particle level. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 capsid uncoating and its regulation by capsid-binding molecules.
biomedical summary
     The cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and preventing tumor initiation in breast cancer. Contrary to expectations, loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway are frequently found in breast cancer genomic DNA. These mutations were thought to be associated with reduced JNK signaling, which can promote cell proliferation by activating the AP1 transcription factor. However, research has shown that JNK deficiency in the murine breast epithelium leads to genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Furthermore, JNK deficiency accelerates tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer, characterized by widespread early neoplasia and genomic instability.

     The study found that JNK plays a key role in the initiation of tumor development, rather than the growth of established tumors. This suggests that JNK pathway defects are 'driver' mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation. The frequent loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway in human breast cancer may therefore represent 'driver' mutations that promote tumor development. The study demonstrates that JNK loss plays a key role at the early stages of breast cancer development by promoting mammary gland neoplasia.

     The results of this study challenge the previous understanding of the JNK signaling pathway's role in breast cancer. The association of breast cancer with reduced JNK signaling was thought to be a correlation, but the study shows that JNK signaling is actually required to prevent tumor initiation. The JNK signaling pathway may therefore be suppressed in many breast cancers. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer development and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies targeting the JNK pathway.

     The study's major conclusions are that JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer and that JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer. These findings highlight the importance of the JNK signaling pathway in maintaining genome stability and preventing tumor initiation in breast cancer. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the JNK pathway in breast cancer development and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.
A recent study has identified peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) as a crucial enzyme required for the assembly of cilia in various cell types. Cilia are hair-like structures that protrude from the surface of cells and play a vital role in sensing the environment and transmitting signals. The researchers found that PAM is essential for the normal formation of motile and primary cilia in Chlamydomonas, planaria, and mice. In Chlamydomonas, PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Similarly, in planaria, decreased PAM gene expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. In mice, the architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in PAM-deficient embryos was also aberrant.

The study suggests that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to the observed ciliogenesis defects. The researchers propose that PAM plays a key conserved role during the early steps of ciliogenesis, revealing a novel link between amidation and cilium assembly in multiple cell types. PAM is thought to be involved in the biogenesis of the motile cilia present in Chlamydomonas and on the ventral epithelium of planaria, as well as the normal assembly of the primary cilia of neuroepithelial cells in mammals.

Interestingly, while reduction of PAM in Chlamydomonas and planaria resulted in a dramatic defect in ciliary assembly, complete loss of PAM in mice did not abolish primary cilia formation in neuroepithelial cells, although they were significantly shorter than cilia in wild-type animals and in many cases only ciliary stubs were evident. The study highlights the importance of PAM in ciliogenesis and provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the assembly of cilia in different cell types. The findings also suggest that PAM may have a novel and highly conserved signaling or sensory function in eukaryotic cilia.

     Biomedical research has shed light on the critical roles of class III myosins (Myo3) and actin-bundling protein Espin in regulating the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. Defects in these proteins have been linked to hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif (THDI), but the mechanism by which Myo3 acts through Espin1 to regulate actin bundle assembly and stabilization was unclear.

     Recent studies have revealed that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, providing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 have elucidated the mechanism of binding and revealed a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. Furthermore, Myo3-mediated cross-linking has been shown to promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1.

     Research has also suggested that Myo3 binding can release auto-inhibition and increase the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles. Myo3a and Myo3b have been found to co-localize with Espin1 at the tips of stereocilia of hair cells, and co-expression of Myo3a and Espin1 can stimulate elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti hair cells.

     The interaction between Myo3 and Espin1 is thought to promote the formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia. The THDI mediates binding of Myo3 to its cargo protein Espin1, allowing Myo3 to transport Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures. Once localized, Espin1 promotes the elongation of actin protrusions.

     The study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein. The full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work. The findings provide new insights into the molecular basis governing the Myo3 and Espin1 interaction and highlight the critical roles of Myo3 and Espin1 in stereocilia development and maintenance.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in various cellular functions, including synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, and gene expression. These channels translate membrane depolarization into calcium influx, enabling cells to respond to electrical activity. Researchers have sought to understand the molecular mechanisms governing the specific voltage-sensing properties of these channels.

     To investigate the structural determinants of voltage-gating properties in calcium channels, scientists combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1.1. The study aimed to identify the molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage-sensing properties.

     The researchers generated advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1.1 VSDs using the Rosetta computational modeling software. These models revealed the basic features of the sliding helix model, which describes the voltage-sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. The study found that stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics.

     The results suggest that specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels. The study's findings provide a mechanistic model explaining how distinct ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can result in the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated calcium channels. The results were supported by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis, which showed that alterations of kinetic properties recognized experimentally were reliably reproduced and explained by the computer model.

     The study fills an important gap in the understanding of the voltage-sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. The results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the specific voltage-sensing properties of calcium channels, which are essential for various cellular functions. The study's findings have implications for understanding the regulation of cellular excitability and the coupling of electrical activity to fundamental cell functions.
Summary
     The study investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in adult visual plasticity, specifically in the primary visual cortex (V1) of healthy and stroke-affected brains. MMPs have been associated with experience-dependent plasticity in the juvenile brain, but their function in the adult brain is not well understood. The researchers used a combination of in vivo optical imaging and behavioral vision tests to examine the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice. The results showed that a 7-day application of an MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity in healthy animals, indicating that MMPs are essential for adult visual plasticity. In contrast, treatment with the MMP-inhibitor once, but not twice, following a stroke rescued plasticity, which is normally lost under these conditions. These findings suggest that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur. The study highlights the importance of precise regulation of MMP-activity for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain and offers new opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke. The results also reveal a critical role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and suggest that MMP-activity must be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur. Overall, the study demonstrates a vital role of MMPs for adult visual cortex plasticity, particularly for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after monocular deprivation. The findings expand previous studies from juvenile rats and provide new insights into the complex relationship between MMPs and brain plasticity.
summary
     Biomedical research has made significant progress in understanding the structure and function of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors, which are crucial for signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses. AMPA receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels composed of four subunits that assemble as a dimer-of-dimers. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have provided full-length structures of AMPA receptors, both alone and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures suggest that the dimers may undergo substantial lateral motions during activation, resulting in the opening of the extracellular layer along the central twofold symmetry axis.

     To investigate this further, researchers used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations of functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. The results indicate that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can become trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. However, the presence of Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, the extracellular domains of AMPA receptors are likely to remain compact during activation and desensitization.

     The study suggests that the extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission and instead work in a fairly compact conformational regime, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions. The presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargazin, plays a crucial role in maintaining the compact conformation of AMPA receptors, which is essential for their proper functioning at synapses. The findings of this study provide new insights into the structural dynamics of AMPA receptors and highlight the importance of auxiliary subunits in regulating their conformational flexibility.
Scientists have long faced challenges in isolating immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with helminths, a type of parasitic worm, due to the strong immune response triggered by the infection. This response leads to the production of mucus, tissue remodeling, and the infiltration of immune cells, making it difficult to obtain a clear picture of the immune response. To overcome this challenge, researchers optimized a standard intestinal digestion protocol to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum, the first part of the small intestine.

To validate the accuracy of the isolated cells, the researchers used a high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel, which allowed them to analyze the cells in great detail. They also confirmed their findings using confocal microscopy, a technique that provides high-resolution images of the cells. The combination of the optimized cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis enabled the researchers to identify many known hallmarks of the anti-parasite immune response throughout the entire course of helminth infection.

The researchers characterized the isolated cells using a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel, which incorporated many of the hallmark surface and intracellular markers associated with helminth infections. They found that the cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed them to characterize many known hallmarks of both innate and adaptive anti-parasite immune responses. The changes in immune cell populations were validated using confocal microscopy, and the results showed that many of these changes were only observed locally, highlighting the importance of good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helminths directly.

The researchers were able to quantify specific immune cell populations, such as B220+, Siglec F+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD4-, and CD64+ cells, using confocal microscopy and compared their frequency to the spectral flow cytometry data. The results showed that the cell isolation protocol provided an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses. The study's findings have the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible due to the challenges associated with intestinal digestion during helminth infection.
Scientists have developed a new model to understand how the 20S proteasome, a key enzyme involved in protein degradation, regulates protein half-life and affects various cellular processes. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme that changes its activity over time due to interactions between substrates and products, as well as its structural characteristics. A team of researchers used a combination of experimental and computational modeling approaches to create a comprehensive mathematical model that describes the regulatory components of the 20S proteasome and its interactions with substrates and products.

The model suggests that the rate-limiting step of protein degradation is the transport of substrates into the proteasome, and that the efficiency of this transport varies between human standard and immuno-proteasomes. This difference in transport efficiency affects the total degradation rate and the usage of substrate cleavage sites. The researchers used carefully designed experimental assays and short fluorogenic peptides to study proteasome dynamics in real-time.

The study found that the proteasome dynamics observed in purified 20S proteasomes were similar to those observed in protein homogenates, where 20S proteasomes are surrounded by regulatory molecules. This suggests that the model describes a core set of proteasome features that can reflect proteasome dynamics in more complex cellular environments. The researchers also found that poly-ubiquitin tagging, transport, and peptide-bond hydrolysis regulate protein half-life and affect various metabolic processes in the cell.

The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of proteasomal action, particularly the causes and extent of differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms. The findings have implications for understanding the regulation of protein degradation and its impact on cellular processes, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to protein misfolding and degradation. The model developed in this study can be used to predict the behavior of the 20S proteasome and its interactions with substrates and products, providing a valuable tool for further research in this area.
biomedical summary
     The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission. In Drosophila, histamine recycling is required for visual synaptic transmission. Synaptic histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia and converted to carcinine. Carcinine is then delivered back to photoreceptors, where it is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. However, it was unclear how β-alanine is returned to the laminar glial cells.

     A new β-alanine transporter, named BalaT, has been identified. Null balat mutants exhibited lower levels of β-alanine and less β-alanine accumulation in the retina. BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results provide the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission and suggest that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission.

     The transport of β-alanine seems less important, as it is present at higher concentrations in Drosophila. However, β-alanine recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Establishing and maintaining a β-alanine pool play key roles in sustaining visual synaptic transmission. The majority of pigment granules, which reduce the intensity of light exposure, are formed in retinal pigment cells of the Drosophila compound eye.

     High levels of β-alanine are detected in retinal pigment cells, suggesting that pigment cells may be critical for the transport and storage of β-alanine in this system. An efficient β-alanine recycling system has been proposed to compensate for the rapid loss of β-alanine that occurs in the conversion of histamine to carcinine. Mutations in balat disrupted transport and storage of β-alanine in the retina, resulting in dramatically reduced photoreceptor synaptic activity and visual behavior.

     This suggests a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and Drosophila. Our current work, together with previous reports, provides evidence for the formulation of a more complete histamine recycling pathway, which is critical for sustaining photoreceptor synaptic transmission. In this pathway, carcinine is synthesized in epithelial glial cells within the optic lamina and is transported back to photoreceptor cells via the synaptic cleft.
Scientists have been trying to understand the role of oxidants in aging for a long time, but the exact mechanisms are still unclear. A recent study used yeast cells to investigate the relationship between oxidants and aging. The researchers found that as yeast cells age, they undergo a sudden collapse in their redox balance, which affects over 80% of the proteins in the cell. This collapse is not caused by an increase in oxidants, as previously thought, but rather by a decrease in a molecule called NADPH, which is essential for maintaining the cell's redox balance.

The study showed that the decrease in NADPH levels occurs early in the aging process and triggers a cascade of events that ultimately leads to the oxidation of the cell's proteins. The researchers also found that caloric restriction, a well-known method for extending lifespan, increases NADPH levels and delays the onset of this cascade. This suggests that the decrease in NADPH levels is a key factor in the aging process.

The study used a type of yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is commonly used as a model organism for studying aging. The researchers monitored the oxidation status of almost 300 different proteins in the yeast cells and found that they undergo a global redox collapse several days before cell death. This collapse is characterized by the oxidation of thiol-containing proteins, which are essential for many cellular processes.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of aging and suggest that the decrease in NADPH levels is a critical factor in the aging process. The study also highlights the importance of maintaining redox balance in cells and suggests that interventions that increase NADPH levels, such as caloric restriction, may be beneficial for extending lifespan. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to understand the specific mechanisms by which NADPH levels affect aging. The study's results also raise the possibility that the oxidation of certain proteins may actually contribute to the beneficial effects of aging, such as the down-regulation of cellular processes that would otherwise shorten lifespan.
summary
     Biologists have long recognized the importance of maintaining homochirality in the biological macromolecular world, where the vast majority of molecules are composed of either L-amino acids or D-amino acids. A key mechanism for enforcing this homochirality is the removal of D-amino acids that are mistakenly attached to transfer RNAs (tRNAs) during protein synthesis. This process is carried out by an enzyme called D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), which selectively removes D-amino acids from tRNAs to prevent them from being incorporated into proteins.

     A recent study has shed light on the mechanism by which DTD achieves its chiral specificity. The researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of DTD from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog. The results show that the enzyme uses a unique "cross-subunit" Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral center of the incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. This dipeptide is inserted into the active site of the dimeric enzyme, where it plays a central role in recognizing the D-amino acid.

     Notably, the recognition mechanism does not involve direct interaction with the side chain of the D-amino acid, but rather relies on weak hydrogen bonds to select for the correct chirality. The researchers found that if an L-amino acid were to bind in the active site, it would have to adopt one of three possible conformations, highlighting the strict chiral specificity of the enzyme.

     The study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselective mechanism that is essential for maintaining homochirality in proteins. By removing D-amino acids from tRNAs, DTD ensures that the cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs is enriched, preventing the incorporation of D-amino acids into proteins. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of translational apparatus and the importance of chiral enforcement mechanisms in preventing D-amino acid infiltration. The study also highlights the crucial role played by weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection, providing a clear explanation for the enzyme's ability to act on multiple D-amino acids.
summary
     The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride ion channel that belongs to the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP after phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory (R) domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Research has shown that ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) opens the pore, and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. However, in certain cystic fibrosis (CF) mutants, spontaneous openings without ATP are possible and are stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator.

     A study has correlated energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. The results show that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may occur even without ATP. This means that coordinated NBD/pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, and ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations.

     The study also found that the presence of bound ATP does not alter the global arrangement of conformations, but rather acts as a'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state. This suggests that the mechanism by which binding of the natural ligand ATP promotes CFTR channel opening is through stabilizing the transition state and the open state, rather than altering the global arrangement of conformations.

     The research provides insights into the understanding of CF mutation and drug mechanisms. The strict coupling between NBD and pore movements, regardless of the absence or presence of ATP, constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent channel gating and helps explain modulatory effects of mutations, or of physiological or pharmacological gating regulators. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying driving forces, which are likely conserved among ABC proteins.
Scientists have discovered a new force that drives the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. This force, called the "orderphobic effect," arises from the pre-transition effect between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. When a protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase is embedded in an ordered bilayer, it stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface. The stiffness of this interface is finite, and when two such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces the net interfacial energy.

     The orderphobic effect is mediated by the proximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. This phenomenon is analogous to the hydrophobic effect, where the strength and range of the force depend on the ability of the protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. The strength and range of the orderphobic force are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.

     The researchers used large-scale molecular simulation to demonstrate the orderphobic effect. They found that a transmembrane protein with a hydrophobic thickness of approximately 2.6 nm will favor the structure of the disordered phase. If the protein is large enough, it can melt the ordered phase near the protein and result in the formation of an order-disorder interface. This interface provides a force for assembly between the proteins.

     The orderphobic effect has implications for our understanding of biological membranes and transmembrane proteins. The researchers predict that the effect may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques. They also note that biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are more complicated than the models considered in this paper, with multiple components allowing for more than one order-disorder transition. A dual to the orderphobic effect also exists, where a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order-disorder interface.

     The discovery of the orderphobic effect provides new insights into the forces that drive the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers. It highlights the importance of the pre-transition effect between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane and the role of protein size and hydrophobic mismatch in mediating this effect. Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of the orderphobic effect for biological membranes and transmembrane proteins.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long used fluorescent calcium indicators to study neural dynamics, but the relationship between these indicators and action potentials (APs) has remained unclear. To address this issue, a recent study characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. The researchers used simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings to investigate the relationship between APs and fluorescence signals.

     The study found that under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of APs were detected, often less than 10% for single AP events and around 20-30% for double AP events. This highlights the limitations of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions. The researchers also found that inferring the underlying AP train or firing rate from calcium imaging remains challenging due to the large field of view required for population imaging studies, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio.

     To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves, the researchers identified isolated AP events and summed APs over 250 ms within each event. They found that only a minority of APs were used to construct these curves. The study also tested the performance of several spike inference models, detecting APs under optimal conditions and under less optimal conditions typical of population imaging experiments.

     The results of this study provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets. The findings have implications for the use of genetically encoded calcium indicators (GECIs) in population imaging studies, which are widely used to report neuronal activity within local populations in vivo. The study's results will facilitate the interpretation of datasets from mainstream transgenic mouse lines, such as the Allen Institute's Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a unique biological switching valve in the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotrogla. This valve allows females to control the direction of seminal flow, enabling them to receive multiple seminal packages from the same or different males within a short time span. The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females of Neotrogla have a penis-like intromittent organ, which they use to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule that is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition.

     The switching valve has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla females to continue mating while the first slot is occupied. This adaptation enables females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. The female penis of Neotrogla bears spines, which females use to anchor males coercively during copulation, likely to obtain more semen from a male.

     In contrast to close relatives, Neotrogla females engage in long copulation durations of 40-70 hours, compared to just 50 minutes for the formation of one seminal capsule. This is an exaggerated adaptation for competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects inhabiting highly oligotrophic cave habitats. The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus. Female-female competition for males to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered the most important factor driving the evolution of the female penis in Neotrogla.
Summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the mechanisms underlying synaptic exocytosis, the process by which neurons release neurotransmitters. A key component of this process is the assembly of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins, which couple their stage-wise folding and assembly to rapid exocytosis in a Munc18-1-dependent manner. However, the functions of the different assembly stages in exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly were not well understood.

    Using optical tweezers, researchers observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). They found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly, with the NTD and CTD responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while the MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures the t-SNARE C-terminus independent of the syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD.

    The researchers also found that Munc18-1 regulates every stage of SNARE assembly, from initiation to stabilization of the half-zippered SNARE complex. They propose a working model to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion. This model suggests that Munc18-1 mainly acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly.

    The study used optical tweezers to observe the forces associated with Munc18-1-mediated de novo SNARE assembly and found that Munc18-1 enhances de novo SNARE assembly by holding the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as the t-SNARE unfolded. The researchers also observed three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with previously reported multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex.

    Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of synaptic exocytosis and the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, shedding light on the complex process of neurotransmitter release. The findings have implications for our understanding of neurological disorders and the development of new therapeutic strategies.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how cells create diverse adhesion sites on their surface to interact with the extracellular matrix. These sites, called focal adhesions, are crucial for cell movement, growth, and signaling. A team of researchers investigated how the integrin adhesome, a group of proteins involved in adhesion site formation, is assembled and exchanged between focal adhesions and the cytosol, the cell's internal fluid.

     Using advanced microscopy techniques, the researchers found that the integrin adhesome is already pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks. These building blocks can rapidly assemble into adhesion sites on the cell surface. Importantly, the researchers discovered that stationary focal adhesions release the same types of protein complexes that they recruit, maintaining a uniform pool of building blocks in the cytosol.

     The findings suggest that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks that facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. The building blocks are spatially uniform around stationary focal adhesions, indicating that they exchange with the cytosol without altering their composition. This symmetric exchange preserves the specifications of the building blocks and maintains the assembly logic of the system.

     The researchers propose a model in which the integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks. At the plasma membrane, these building blocks can self-assemble into adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions. This model ensures that the self-assembly process remains controlled and specific, preventing the formation of aberrant structures.

     The study provides new insights into the assembly logic of adhesion sites and highlights the importance of pre-assembled multi-protein building blocks in facilitating rapid and modular self-assembly. The findings have implications for our understanding of cell-matrix interactions and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to adhesion site dysfunction.
Researchers have identified a common electrophysiological marker that can track states of reduced arousal in humans, including different sleep stages and anesthesia. This marker is based on the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity. The study used intracranial and surface EEG recordings from four independent data sets to demonstrate that the spectral slope can distinguish wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

The researchers hypothesized that the spectral slope would become more negative (i.e., the power spectrum steeper) in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. They also predicted that the spectral slope could discriminate wakefulness from NREM and REM sleep. The study found that the spectral slope differed significantly between wakefulness and propofol anesthesia, and this state-dependent modulation generalized to other forms of decreased arousal, such as sleep.

The researchers analyzed two datasets obtained during a full night of sleep and found that the spectral slope could discern wakefulness from different sleep stages, including REM and NREM sleep. They also demonstrated that the non-oscillatory, aperiodic part of the power spectrum, which is devoid of prominent low-frequency oscillatory components, reliably differentiates wakefulness from all three states of reduced arousal level, namely REM, N3 sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol.

The study's findings provide empirical evidence for the notion that the slope in the range from 30 to 45 Hz correlates well with all stages of arousal. The spectral slope tracked changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and is observable on a wide range of timescales from sub-second epochs to full night recordings. The study's results provide a common electrophysiological marker that can be used to track states of reduced arousal in humans, including different sleep stages and anesthesia.
summary
     Biologists have discovered that chloroplasts in plant cells are connected to the nucleus by dynamic tubular extensions called stromules, which play a crucial role in the plant's innate immune response. These stromules extend along microtubules (MTs) in the cell and are stabilized by actin filaments (AFs), which provide anchor points for the stromules. Research has shown that the organization of MTs directly affects the dynamics of stromules, with stabilization of MTs increasing the number and length of stromules.

     During an innate immune response, stromules extend along MTs towards the nucleus and attach to actin anchor points surrounding the nucleus. These perinuclear stromule attachments guide chloroplasts to the nucleus, facilitating their movement. This process is not limited to immune responses, as stromule-directed chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions without immune induction, suggesting it is a general function of stromules in epidermal cells.

     The study found that microtubules are required for stromule extension and movement, as depolymerization of MTs led to stromule retraction, and stabilization of MTs increased stromule frequency. Actin filaments, on the other hand, provide anchor points for stromules but are not required for their extension. The results suggest that MTs and AFs work together to facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during an innate immune response.

     The researchers propose a model in which stromules extend along MTs and connect to AF anchor points surrounding the nucleus, facilitating stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts to the nucleus during innate immunity. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of stromule dynamics and the role of cytoskeletal elements in plant cells, which support various cellular functions, including cytoplasmic streaming, cell division, and nuclear positioning. The findings have implications for understanding the importance of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity and the molecular components required for stromule dynamics and movement.
Scientists have developed a new method to predict how amino acids interact with each other across protein interfaces, which are areas where two or more proteins come together to form a complex. This method uses evolutionary information to identify pairs of amino acids that are likely to be in contact with each other. The researchers applied this method to 50S ribosomal units and 28 other bacterial protein complexes with known structures and found that the predicted pairs of amino acids were almost always in contact in the complex, as long as there were enough aligned sequences.

    The team then used this method to make predictions for 36 protein complexes with unknown structures and generated models for four of these complexes, including the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter. The results suggest that this method can accurately predict interactions across protein interfaces given a sufficient number of aligned sequences.

    In a large set of complexes with known structures, the researchers found that pairs of amino acids that covary (i.e., change together over time) are almost always in contact in the three-dimensional structure, provided there are enough aligned sequences. They also found that significant residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs, indicating that this method can be useful for predicting whether two proteins interact.

    This study builds on previous research that has used global statistical models to coevolution-based contact prediction across interfaces, but has been limited to specific cases such as the histidine-kinase/response-regulator two-component system. The new method developed in this study can be applied to a wide range of protein complexes and has the potential to contribute to the determination of the structures of these biologically important complexes. The predicted residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces of unknown structure are presented in Figure 3, which shows strongly co-evolving residue pairs for complexes without known structure that had at least one prediction with a GREMLIN score greater than or equal to 0.85.
Summary
     Researchers investigated how people categorize visual patterns by using a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a visual categorization task. Participants' eye movements were tracked while they viewed patterns, and their scan paths were found to follow an active sensing strategy. This strategy incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. The results showed that categorization performance improved when locations were revealed to participants by an optimal Bayesian active sensor algorithm.

     The study used a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and the active sensor algorithm to estimate that a major portion of the apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. The central process of selecting fixation locations was found to be around 70% efficient in the task. The results suggest that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations.

     The study extended the range of active sensing to tasks with arbitrary, not necessarily spatial, latent features, such as categories. It provided the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information gathering under active eye movements by matching the observer model to participants' performance. This allowed the researchers to dissociate the contributions of the eye-movement selection process from those of perceptual, motor, and decision processes.

     The study estimated the efficiency of eye movements in a high-level task on a fixation-by-fixation basis. The results showed that participants' eye movements were substantially more efficient than heuristic strategies that only employed a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy. They were about 70% as efficient as the optimal active sensor that operated with the participants' own prior bias, perception noise, and saccadic inaccuracies.

     The study used a gaze-contingent categorization task to track the eye and successively reveal small apertures of the image at each fixation location. This allowed for a mathematically tractable quantification of the information at any fixation location. The visual patterns used in the study were statistically well-controlled and relatively simple, ensuring that foveal vision would dominate.
summary
     Biomedical research has made significant progress in understanding the transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells. The nuclear pore complex (NPC) plays a crucial role in this process, allowing thousands of molecules to pass through, including large cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes. However, the requirements for nuclear import of these large cargoes are not well understood, particularly the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and the effect of size on import efficiency.

     To address this knowledge gap, a recent study investigated the nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17-36 nanometers, with tunable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. The results showed that the requirements for nuclear transport can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC.

     The study found that the requirements for nuclear transport scale non-linearly with size and can be influenced by the biochemical or physicochemical properties of the cargo surface. For small cargo transport, these properties have been shown to influence nuclear transport in previous studies. The theoretical model used in this study assumes that the capsids do not interact with each other during transport through the pore.

     The study also highlights the importance of nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) and nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) in facilitating the rapid entry of cargoes into the nucleus. The NTR-mediated transport process has been characterized in previous studies, typically focusing on cargoes with one to five NLSs, and their nuclear import kinetics have been shown to follow a mono-exponential behavior.

     The findings of this study have implications for understanding the export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes. The results suggest that basic principles of this work could help in the future to better understand these processes. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular determinants of large cargo transport into the nucleus, shedding light on the complex process of nucleocytoplasmic transport in eukaryotic cells.
Summary
     The co-stimulatory molecule CD28 plays a crucial role in the activation of helper T cells, but its function after T cell priming was not well understood. To investigate this, researchers generated a strain of mice where CD28 was removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. The study found that continued CD28 expression is essential for the expansion of effector CD4+ T cells, particularly T helper type 1 (Th1) cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper (Tfh) cells during viral infection. Additionally, maintained CD28 expression is required for the clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract after oral infection. These findings demonstrate that CD28 persistence is necessary for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, revealing a novel function for CD28 distinct from its role in T cell priming. The study highlights the importance of CD28 in maintaining T cell responses following activation, which is critical for effective immunity to infection.

     The researchers used a mouse model where CD28 was removed from CD4+ T cells after priming to investigate the role of CD28 after T cell activation. They found that CD28 expression is required for the expansion of Th1 cells and for the differentiation and maintenance of Tfh cells. Furthermore, maintained CD28 expression is necessary for the clearance of Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract after oral infection. This demonstrates that CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for intact effector CD4+ T cell responses during infection.

     The study also showed that CD28 signaling is essential for multiple facets of CD4+ T cell activation, including proliferation, survival, glucose metabolism, and migration. CD28-deficient mice have reduced expansion of effector CD4+ T cells and do not form Th1 and Tfh cells after infection or immunization. Tfh differentiation requires CD28 ligation during interactions of primed T cells with B cells, and fully differentiated Tfh cells require CD28 expression for their survival. By contrast, Th1 cells do not require CD28 for their maintenance, but do for their expansion following T cell activation. The study highlights the importance of CD28 in maintaining T cell responses following activation, which is critical for effective immunity to infection.
summary
     Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium that colonizes the stomach, has a unique helical shape that allows it to efficiently colonize the stomach lining. However, the molecular mechanisms that generate this helical shape are not well understood. Researchers investigated how H. pylori maintains its helical shape and found that two cytoskeletal proteins, MreB and CcmA, play a crucial role in defining zones of enhanced cell wall synthesis.

     The study used quantitative 3D microscopy analysis to show that cell wall growth is enhanced at both the inner and outer curves of the helix. Immunofluorescence revealed that MreB is most abundant at the inner curve, while CcmA is most abundant at the outer curve. The researchers also found that strains of H. pylori expressing variants of CcmA with altered polymerization properties lost their helical shape and associated positive Gaussian curvatures.

     The study suggests that MreB promotes cell wall synthesis at the inner curve of the helix, while CcmA promotes synthesis at the outer curve. This patterning of cell wall synthesis is necessary for maintaining the helical shape of H. pylori. The researchers propose a model where MreB and CcmA work together to promote cell wall synthesis at different regions of the helix, allowing H. pylori to maintain its unique shape.

     The study also found that H. pylori achieves a broader distribution of sidewall Gaussian curvature than other curved-rod bacteria, such as Campylobacter crescentus and Vibrio cholerae. The researchers used computational tools to demonstrate that H. pylori uses distinct mechanisms to achieve these curvatures.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that generate the helical shape of H. pylori and highlights the importance of MreB and CcmA in defining zones of enhanced cell wall synthesis. The findings have implications for our understanding of bacterial cell shape and the development of new treatments for H. pylori infections.
summary
     The protein Cdc48 plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by controlling the activity of two deubiquitylases (DUBs), Ubp12 and Ubp2. These DUBs have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion, with Ubp12 promoting fusion and Ubp2 inhibiting it. Cdc48 integrates the activities of Ubp12 and Ubp2 by promoting the proteolysis of Ubp12, which in turn stabilizes pro-fusion ubiquitylation on the mitofusin Fzo1. In contrast, the loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2, leading to the removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 and inhibition of fusion.

     The study reveals a new cascade of ubiquitylation events involving Cdc48, Ubp12, and Ubp2, which fine-tunes the fusogenic activity of Fzo1. This cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation, allowing for mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover. The research also revises recent findings linking Ubp2 and Mdm30, a protein that catalyzes the formation of pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1.

     The study shows that Ubp12 and Ubp2 cleave different ubiquitylated forms of Fzo1, with Ubp12 stabilizing Fzo1 and promoting fusion, and Ubp2 targeting Fzo1 for degradation and inhibiting fusion. Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which in turn negatively regulates Ubp2, explaining why these two DUBs exert opposite effects on their targets and on ubiquitin homeostasis. The study proposes that Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a small number of ubiquitin moieties, which are too short to target proteasomal turnover, and that Ubp2 recognizes longer ubiquitin chains that target Fzo1 for degradation.

     Overall, the research provides new insights into the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and the role of Cdc48 in integrating the activities of Ubp12 and Ubp2 to control the balance between activation and repression of mitochondrial fusion. The study highlights the complexity of ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial fusion and the importance of Cdc48 in fine-tuning this process.
summary
     The study investigated whether vision is necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC), a region of the brain responsible for processing visual information. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine VOTC responses to sound categories in sighted and early blind individuals, and visual categories in a separate group of sighted individuals. The results showed that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind people, using a representational structure and connectivity similar to that found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group, using a representational format closer to the one found in vision.

The study found that VOTC in blind individuals represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. This suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of congenitally blind and sighted people that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response, despite qualitative nuances in the categorical organization of VOTC between modalities and groups. The results demonstrate that a categorical organization similar to the one found in vision can emerge in VOTC in the absence of visual experience, and that such categorical response to sounds is actually enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind people.

The researchers used representational similarity analysis to show that categorical membership is the main factor that predicts the representational structure of sounds in VOTC in blind people, rather than lower-level acoustic attributes of sounds. The study also found that the categorical representation of auditory stimuli in VOTC of both blind and sighted individuals exhibits different qualitative nuances compared to the categorical organization generated by visual stimuli in sighted people. The results suggest that the overlap in categorical responses between groups may be due to crossmodal plasticity, where the occipital cortex represents visual attributes in sighted individuals and acoustic attributes in blind individuals.

Overall, the study provides evidence that VOTC can develop a categorical organization in response to sound categories, even in the absence of visual experience, and that this organization is more robust in blind individuals. The findings have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of categorical perception and the role of experience in shaping brain function.
Scientists have discovered a strain of the fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a common fruit fly species, in the laboratory. This fungus, known as E. muscae 'Berkeley', causes infected flies to exhibit moribund behaviors, such as climbing upward, extending their proboscides, and raising their wings, which allows the fungus to launch infectious spores from their abdomens. The researchers found that E. muscae invades the nervous system of the fly, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus induces behavioral changes.

To study the E. muscae-D. melanogaster system, the researchers isolated and characterized the E. muscae 'Berkeley' strain and its impact on D. melanogaster behavior in the laboratory. They found that the invasion of the nervous system by E. muscae 'Berkeley' grants the fungus direct access to host neurons, which may be mechanistically important for achieving behavioral manipulation of the host fly. However, the researchers note that there are other possible ways E. muscae 'Berkeley' could alter host behavior.

The researchers propose four general mechanisms by which E. muscae is able to achieve behavioral manipulation: (1) direct manipulation of host neurons, (2) alteration of host hormone levels, (3) disruption of host immune response, and (4) manipulation of host behavior through chemical signals. To test these mechanisms, the researchers exposed house flies to E. muscae 'Berkeley'-infected D. melanogaster and observed that the house flies died and sporulated, indicating that they had been killed by the fungus.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of how E. muscae 'Berkeley' infection progresses in D. melanogaster at the molecular level, the researchers measured transcription changes in both host and fungus at 24-hour time points over 5 days. They found that early on, infected flies are phenotypically indistinguishable from uninfected animals, making it challenging to study the molecular basis of behavioral manipulation. The researchers believe that the E. muscae-D. melanogaster system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior, given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster.
Researchers have generated transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to better understand RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. Using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP), the team mapped the binding locations of these factors, which are involved in mRNA deadenylation, decapping, exosome-mediated degradation, and nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA surveillance pathways.

The analysis revealed how these degradation factors vary in their binding specificities for different classes of RNAs and their preferred locations on RNA transcripts. Global comparisons with previously published profiles of other RNA-binding factors showed clusters of factors that co-occupy RNAs or co-localize on RNAs. The study found that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, while decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step.

The results also suggest that decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, which are rapidly degraded due to inefficient translation. Furthermore, the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). The study provides a rich resource for future research on eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism.

The findings are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling based on mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation. This is consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step in the degradation process. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how RNA degradation pathways are selected and how the RNA sequence influences this selection.
Scientists have discovered a new type of chromatin, called bivalent chromatin, that plays a crucial role in the rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to a pathogen signal in Arabidopsis plants. Camalexin is a potent defense compound that helps protect plants from bacterial and fungal infections. The researchers found that two epigenetic modifications, trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and acetylation of histone 3 lysine 18 (H3K18ac), work together to form this bivalent chromatin. These modifications have opposite effects on gene expression, with H3K27me3 repressing gene expression and H3K18ac activating it.

The study used publicly available epigenomic data and in vivo chromatin modification mapping to identify the presence of H3K27me3 and H3K18ac on camalexin biosynthesis genes. The researchers then used genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry to examine the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin in the induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes. They found that mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac had altered induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation.

The study suggests that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin, which the researchers named "kairostat," is essential for controlling the timely induction of gene expression in response to stress stimuli in plants. This bivalent chromatin maintains the proper timing of camalexin gene induction upon a pathogen signal. The researchers also found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac co-localize on camalexin biosynthesis genes, forming a previously uncharacterized form of bivalent chromatin.

The study provides new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin is regulated at the epigenetic level. However, the researchers note that other known mechanisms regulating camalexin genes may also affect transcriptional kinetics and metabolite accumulation. Future studies could investigate whether transcription factors that directly bind to promoters of camalexin biosynthesis genes interact with proteins that deposit or remove both epigenetic marks forming bivalent chromatin upon stress signals. The discovery of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin and its role on camalexin biosynthesis genes provides a molecular handle for future investigations.
summary
     The study investigated the role of EZH2, a histone methyltransferase, in neurogenic astrocytes of the adult mouse subventricular zone (SVZ). Astrocytes in the SVZ serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) throughout adult life, and EZH2 expression was found to be a distinguishing feature of these cells. The research showed that EZH2 is required for neurogenesis, independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation. This was demonstrated by rescuing cell proliferation in Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs through Ink4a/Arf-deficiency, but neurogenesis remained defective.

     Further investigation revealed that Olig2, a bHLH transcription factor, is a direct target of EZH2, and its repression is critical for neuronal differentiation. Additionally, EZH2 prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SVZ cells, including local astroglia, also express EZH2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis.

     The study identified distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. EZH2 directly repressed the Ink4a/Arf locus to enable SVZ NSC self-renewal. In the human brain, EZH2 was also expressed in astroglia and neuronal precursors of the early infant SVZ, suggesting a key role in postnatal human neurogenesis.

     The results indicate that EZH2 is a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia, enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population. The study provides novel insights into the complex role of EZH2 in normal development and gliomagenesis. Future studies may address whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes. Acute deletion of Ezh2 in SVZ NSCs resulted in decreased neurogenesis, and this deficiency in part related to reduced cell proliferation. Re-expression of Ezh2 in Ezh2-deleted, Ink4a/Arf-null SVZ NSCs rescued neurogenesis, indicating that EZH2 has a role in SVZ neurogenesis distinct from its function in Ink4a/Arf repression.
Summary
     Scientists have long known that viruses play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities and influencing ecosystem functions. However, studying the interactions between viruses and their hosts has been challenging due to the difficulties in cultivating certain microorganisms. A recent study used single-cell genomics to investigate the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). The researchers isolated 127 single-cell amplified genomes (SAGs) from SUP05 bacteria and identified 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae.

     The study found that approximately one-third of SUP05 bacteria were infected with viruses, with higher infection frequencies observed in areas with more severe oxygen deficiency. The researchers also discovered that Microviridae viruses were clonal, suggesting that they were recovered from bloom-terminating viruses. Furthermore, the study revealed systematic co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses, indicating previously unrecognized cooperation modes between these viruses.

     The researchers analyzed 186 microbial and viral metagenomes from the OMZ and found that SUP05 viruses persisted for years but remained endemic to the OMZ. Notably, the study identified virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase, which suggests that SUP05 viruses can reprogram their host's energy metabolism. This finding has significant implications for understanding the role of viruses in modulating biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs.

     The study used single-cell genomics to directly link SUP05 viruses and their hosts across defined gradients of oxygen and sulfide over a 3-year time interval in a model OMZ ecosystem. The researchers obtained a SUP05 single-cell genomic dataset spanning defined redox gradients in the Saanich Inlet water column and identified SUP05-associated viruses infecting SAGs. The resulting virus-host pairs were used to estimate viral diversity, activity, dispersion, and potential impact on SUP05 population dynamics and metabolic capacity.

     The study found that SUP05 Microviridae contigs were inconsistently detected due to methodological biases, so the researchers focused on dsDNA viral contigs. All four SUP05 Caudovirales contigs were absent from surface waters but repeatedly detected within and below the oxycline, consistent with SUP05 water column disposition. The study also found that putative SUP05 phage contained genes encoding reverse dissimilatory sulfite reductase A and C, positing a role for viruses in modulating the marine sulfur cycle. Overall, the study provides new insights into the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria and highlights the importance of viruses in modulating biogeochemical cycling in OMZs.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a protein called TTC26/DYF13 as a crucial component of the intraflagellar transport (IFT) system, which is responsible for assembling and maintaining cilia and flagella in cells. IFT is a highly conserved mechanism involving over 20 proteins, but the functions of individual IFT proteins are not well understood. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, the researchers found that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. They also discovered that knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii resulted in short cilia with abnormal motility.

     Notably, the IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in the dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. However, proteomic and biochemical analyses revealed that a specific set of proteins involved in motility was depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These findings suggest that different IFT proteins are responsible for transporting different subsets of cargo, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery.

     Further analysis showed that TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis, the process of forming cilia, nor for the assembly or movement of the IFT particle itself. Instead, it plays a specialized role in transporting a specific set of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella. This is in contrast to other IFT proteins, which are necessary for ciliogenesis. The researchers also found that the dyf13 mutant cells could assemble cilia/flagella, but they were shorter than control cilia/flagella.

     The study provides new insights into the role of TTC26/DYF13 in the IFT system and highlights the complexity of the IFT machinery. The findings suggest that different IFT proteins are responsible for transporting different subsets of cargo, and that TTC26/DYF13 plays a critical role in transporting motility-related proteins into cilia/flagella. Further research is needed to clarify the role of TTC26/DYF13 in determining the length of cilia and flagella.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the interaction between melanoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) plays a crucial role in the development of metastasis in melanoma, a type of skin cancer. Metastasis is the process by which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor site to other parts of the body, and it is often associated with poor clinical outcomes. In this study, researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between melanoma cells and LECs in the development of metastasis.

The study used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of LECs on the behavior of melanoma cells. The results showed that the interaction between melanoma cells and LECs led to the activation of matrix-metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14), Notch3, and β1-integrin in the melanoma cells. This activation was associated with the development of an invasive sprouting phenotype in the melanoma cells, which is characterized by the ability of the cells to invade and spread through three-dimensional matrices.

The researchers found that MMP14 was necessary for the activation of Notch3 and β1-integrin in the melanoma cells, and that this activation was required for the development of the invasive sprouting phenotype. Furthermore, the study showed that the interaction between melanoma cells and LECs led to an increase in metastasis of melanoma xenografts in mice, which was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3.

The study also used a zebrafish xenograft model to investigate the role of LECs in the development of metastasis. The results showed that the interaction between melanoma cells and LECs led to an increase in metastasis of melanoma cells in the zebrafish, which was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between melanoma cells and LECs in the development of metastasis. The findings suggest that the activation of MMP14, Notch3, and β1-integrin in melanoma cells is a key event in the development of metastasis, and that LECs play a crucial role in promoting the invasive sprouting phenotype of melanoma cells. These findings have important implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of melanoma.
Summary
     MicroRNA-9 (miR-9) is a noncoding RNA that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in the brain. While its function in neural progenitors has been well characterized, its role in dendritic and synaptic development has remained largely unknown. To investigate this, researchers developed a transgenic mouse line that allows for the conditional inactivation of miR-9 in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, the study found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo.

     The researchers used a double reporter mouse line to characterize the activity pattern of miR-9 in different cell types in the brain. They found that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. Furthermore, they demonstrated that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth.

     The study focused on the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation and revealed a critical role for miR-9 in the control of dendritic development in vivo. Other miRNAs have been shown to influence dendritic growth, suggesting that the expression of genes orchestrating this process is under complex post-transcriptional regulation. The researchers also found that miR-9/REST regulation might play other non-developmental roles in some mature neuronal populations.

     The study describes the first transgenic sponge mouse line that allows for conditional inactivation of an miRNA family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Analysis of this miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mouse line reveals a prominent role for miR-9 in postmitotic neuronal differentiation as a regulator of dendritic development through repression of REST expression. The results indicate that effects found in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice are essentially cell-intrinsic and that miR-9 exerts its proactive function in modeling dendritic arbors as a key player of neuronal genetic programs controlling dendrite development. Furthermore, the study found that basal synaptic transmission was impaired in miR-9 sponge-expressing mice. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of miR-9 in dendritic development and synaptic transmission in vivo.
Summary
     Researchers investigated the neural basis of social visual engagement difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a large sample of ASD toddlers and non-ASD comparison groups. They found that ASD-related functional hypoconnectivity exists between the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks. Specifically, a subtype of ASD characterized by pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties, known as GeoPref ASD, was found to have marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity. This hypoconnectivity was also linked to increased severity of social-communication difficulties in GeoPref ASD individuals. The study suggests that early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature of GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development. This finding has implications for early intervention and treatment targets in individuals with GeoPref ASD. The researchers used a simple eye-tracking test to identify the GeoPref ASD subtype, which is characterized by high levels of social or non-social visual preferences in early development. The study highlights the importance of heterogeneity in early social engagement in understanding functional connectivity differences in ASD toddlers. The results support the idea that ASD is characterized by functional hypoconnectivity between the DMN and visual circuits in primary visual cortex (PVC) and OTC as well as attention circuitry. The study's findings provide new insights into the neural basis of social visual engagement difficulties in ASD and may inform the development of targeted interventions for early ASD diagnosis and treatment.
biomedical summary
     Biologists have long recognized the importance of hematopoietic organs in maintaining homeostasis in coelomate animals. In Drosophila melanogaster, the lymph gland produces two types of blood cells: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. While plasmatocytes are known to proliferate and increase in number during larval development, the origin of crystal cells has remained unclear. Recent research has shown that new crystal cells in Drosophila larvae originate through a process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation, which occurs in sessile hemocyte clusters. This process is contingent upon the integrity of these structures and relies on Notch-dependent signaling events.

     The study of hematopoietic organs and their function is crucial for understanding how different mature blood cells arise and how their numbers are controlled. In Drosophila, embryonic hematopoiesis produces two types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells that are often functionally compared to vertebrate macrophages. The increase in circulating and sessile crystal cell numbers during Drosophila larval development has been a paradox, as no mature crystal cell has been seen dividing during larval stages, and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions.

     Research has shown that the hemocyte population found in circulation and in sessile patches expands throughout larval development. Plasmatocytes are mitotically active cells that expand during larval development by self-renewal. However, the origin of crystal cells has remained unclear. The study reveals that new crystal cells in Drosophila larvae originate through a process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation, which occurs in sessile hemocyte clusters. This process is contingent upon the integrity of these structures and relies on Notch-dependent signaling events.

     The existence of a hematopoietic tissue in Drosophila that relies on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems. The study of hematopoietic organs and their function is essential for understanding how different mature blood cells arise and how their numbers are controlled. The discovery of a hematopoietic tissue in Drosophila that relies on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis brings us a step closer to addressing these outstanding fundamental questions of Drosophila hematopoiesis.
summary
     Biologists have long been puzzled by the phenomenon of aneuploidy, where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes, which is linked to various diseases but also facilitates organismal evolution. While laboratory strains are highly sensitive to aneuploidy, researchers have found that aneuploidy is surprisingly common in wild yeast isolates. These wild yeast strains show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes, suggesting that they have developed a mechanism to buffer the deleterious effects of aneuploidy.

     To investigate this phenomenon, scientists generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes. They found that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes, which means that the expression of these genes is adjusted in proportion to the number of copies. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations, but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, indicating that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes.

     The researchers also discovered that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to certain wild yeast strains, such as oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. This suggests that aneuploidy can provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

     The study found that chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast strains, which are inherently tolerant of aneuploidy and display an active mode of gene-dosage compensation at the transcript level for specific classes of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are buffered against copy-number variation and show elevated rates of gene amplification in natural isolates.

     The results provide new insight into how cells can tolerate duplication of toxic genes long enough for new phenotypes to evolve. The study shows that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression, which is in part due to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes. The findings raise the possibility of natural genetic variation in dosage compensation and suggest that while the expression of dosage-compensated genes is controlled in proportion to gene copy, many genes escape dosage compensation in response to aneuploidy and can contribute significantly to phenotypic variation.
Summary
     Biologists have discovered a new type of photoreceptor in a flatworm called Maritigrella crozieri. This photoreceptor, called xenopsin, was previously thought to belong to a different group of light-sensitive proteins called Gαi-coupled ciliary opsins. However, research has shown that xenopsin actually diverged from ciliary opsins a long time ago, before the evolution of bilateral animals.

     The study found that xenopsin is expressed in two types of cells in the flatworm: in the eyes of the larva and in extraocular cells around the brain of the adult. These extraocular cells are unique because they contain hundreds of cilia, which are long, thin extensions of the cell membrane, inside a specialized compartment called a phaosome. This is similar to the structure of rod cells in the eyes of jawed vertebrates, which also enclose their cilia inside their own plasma membrane.

     The researchers used human cells to test whether xenopsin can drive phototransduction, the process by which light is converted into a signal that can be interpreted by the brain. They found that xenopsin can indeed drive phototransduction, primarily by coupling to a type of G protein called Gαi. This is similar to how c-opsin, another type of light-sensitive protein, works.

     The study also found that xenopsin is expressed in the cilia of cells that form the eyes of the flatworm, suggesting that the VxPx motif, a sequence of amino acids, is involved in transporting xenopsin to the cilia. The discovery of xenopsin+ ciliary cells in the eyes of protostome larvae challenges our current understanding of opsin and photoreceptor evolution, as it deviates from the typical pattern of extraocular ciliary photoreceptors and ocular rhabdomeric/microvillar photoreceptors found in other invertebrates.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of photoreceptors and the diversity of ciliary photoreceptors in metazoans. It also highlights the similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin, and provides molecular and functional evidence for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms.

     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how spatial and temporal cues specify neuronal diversity in neural progenitors. Drosophila (fruit fly) neuroblasts, which are individually identifiable and have known spatial and temporal transcription factors, provide a suitable model system to investigate this process. A recent study aimed to determine whether spatial and temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts by examining the genomic binding sites of the temporal transcription factor Hunchback (Hb) in two neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that produce different progeny.

     The researchers used Targeted DamID to identify the genomic binding sites of Hb in NB5-6 and NB7-4. The results showed that Hb targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Furthermore, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. The study also found that the spatial factor Gsb/Pax3, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4.

     The data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage. The study identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4, which are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. This research contributes to our understanding of how spatial and temporal factors are integrated during neurogenesis and has implications for understanding the development of neuronal diversity in both Drosophila and mammals. The findings suggest that early-acting spatial factors play a crucial role in establishing neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, which in turn influence the binding of temporal transcription factors and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding how P2X receptors, a type of ion channel, open and close in response to extracellular ATP. These receptors play a crucial role in various physiological processes, including pain sensation and neurotransmission. Recent studies have provided insights into the molecular motions of the extracellular domain of P2X receptors upon agonist binding, but the mechanism of pore opening remains unclear.

    To gain a better understanding of this process, researchers used photo-switchable cross-linkers, or "molecular tweezers," to monitor the distance between specific residues in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. This approach allowed the scientists to create high-resolution models of the channel in both open and closed states. The results showed that the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure, and that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion.

    The study used a novel chemical-based method to explore the gating motion of the rat P2X2 receptor by cross-linking engineered cysteine residues in the transmembrane domain with photo-switchable azobenzene tweezers. The end-to-end distance of these tweezers can be controlled by light, allowing the researchers to monitor the distance between specific residues during activation. The data revealed that the TM2 helices in the P2X2 receptor contain a critical "hinge" that facilitates their vertical bending, allowing the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices to come closer during activation.

    The findings of this study provide new insights into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins. The use of photo-switchable cross-linkers and molecular dynamics simulations allowed the researchers to create high-resolution models of the channel in both open and closed states, shedding light on the complex process of pore opening. These results have significant implications for our understanding of P2X receptor function and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to these receptors.
summary
     Biomedical research has long assumed that animal cells divide using a uniform molecular mechanism during cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two. However, recent evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types is more varied than previously thought. A study on the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo has identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton.

Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, researchers found that one cell (P2) regulates its cytokinetic variation cell-intrinsically, while another cell (EMS) regulates its variation cell-extrinsically, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2. This suggests that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.

The study used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. The researchers found cell-type-specific differences in both the functional levels and temporal window of activity required for forminCYK-1 activity, but not myosin-IINMY-2 activity, during cytokinesis.

Inactivation of forminCYK-1 by thermal upshift to restrictive temperature at any time before mid-ring constriction resulted in cytokinesis failure 100% of the time in the one-cell embryo. However, in the four-cell embryo, cell-type-specific variation was observed in the molecular requirement for forminCYK-1, but not myosin-IINMY-2.

The study demonstrates that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. Each cell in the four-cell embryo has a unique cell identity and can be individually scored for contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis. The findings suggest that the mechanisms of cytokinetic variation are complex and involve both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors.
biomedical summary
     Biologists have discovered a new role for the flagellar sheath of certain bacteria in triggering an immune response in the host. The flagellar sheath is a membranous structure that encases the flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including human pathogens such as Vibrio cholerae. While the function of the sheath has been unknown, researchers have hypothesized that it may allow these bacteria to evade the host's immune response to the immunogenic flagellin subunit.

     Using the model symbiosis between Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, scientists have found that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum promotes the release of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a potent bacteria-derived immunogen. LPS is found in the flagellar sheath and is recognized by the host's immune system. This discovery suggests that the flagellar sheath does not evade the host's immune response, but rather triggers it.

     The researchers used the model symbiosis to study the effect of the flagellar sheath on host recognition. They found that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both V. fischeri and V. cholerae leads to the release of LPS, which is then recognized by the host's immune system. This is a new role for the flagellar sheath, which was previously thought to be of unknown function.

     The discovery of this new role for the flagellar sheath has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella. It also raises important biophysical questions about the function of the sheathed flagellum. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis, including the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, the squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS, and the role of flagellin in activating host responses.

     This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between bacteria and their hosts, and highlights the importance of the flagellar sheath in mediating these interactions. The discovery of a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering an immune response has significant implications for our understanding of bacterial virulence and the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.
Summary
     Genome instability is a phenomenon associated with mitotic errors and cancer, leading to deleterious rearrangements and genetic novelty. However, the mechanisms and evolutionary role of genome instability remain poorly understood. This study investigates extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, a process resulting from the hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histones H3. The researchers found that shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions revealed that breaks are followed by repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair.

The study also found that mutation of the NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery, suggesting that NHEJ plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny. The results indicate that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome, similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid genome elimination. The researchers propose that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks, and occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued.

The study provides evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species. The results suggest that NHEJ contributes to the formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny, and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome. The study provides a tractable, natural system for investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders.

Scientists have long been interested in understanding how plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with environmental challenges. These metabolites are specialized chemicals that help plants adapt to their surroundings. However, the genetic factors that control the production of these metabolites and how they vary across different plant populations are not yet fully understood. A recent study investigated the genetic and environmental factors that influence the production of specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research.

The study analyzed 797 natural Arabidopsis accessions from across Europe and found that the production of specialized metabolites is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors. The researchers used the Arabidopsis glucosinolate (GSL) pathway as a model to study the genetic and environmental factors that shape the production of these metabolites. The GSL pathway is a well-studied system that produces a range of specialized metabolites, including aliphatic glucosinolates.

The study found that the production of aliphatic glucosinolates varies significantly across different Arabidopsis accessions, and that this variation is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors. The researchers identified multiple genetic loci that contribute to the variation in aliphatic glucosinolate production, and found that these loci contain frequent independently generated alleles. This suggests that the production of specialized metabolites is shaped by multiple genetic and environmental factors, and that these factors interact with each other in complex ways.

The study also found that the geographic distribution of aliphatic glucosinolate-producing Arabidopsis accessions is structured by ecological and demographic pressures. This suggests that the production of specialized metabolites is influenced by the local environment and the demographic history of the plant population. The researchers propose that the intersection of environmental pressure, demography, and genomic complexity gives rise to the pattern of metabolic variation across a plant species.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic and environmental factors that shape the production of specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana. The findings suggest that the production of these metabolites is influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors, and that these factors interact with each other in ways that are not yet fully understood. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the production of specialized metabolites and how they contribute to plant adaptation and evolution.
summary
     Biomedical research has traditionally viewed apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, and its molecular mediators, caspases, as tumor suppressors. However, recent studies have suggested that under certain conditions, apoptotic caspases can promote tumor growth and proliferation. A new study in Drosophila (fruit flies) has uncovered a mechanism by which caspases can switch from tumor suppressors to tumor promoters.

     In the study, researchers used a well-studied neoplastic tumor model in Drosophila to investigate the role of caspases in tumor growth. They found that oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras (RasV12) maintain tumorous cells in an "undead" state, where caspases are activated but do not induce cell death. Instead, caspases promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly reactive molecules that can damage cells.

     The ROS generated by caspases recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells, which in turn signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK further amplifies caspase activity, creating a feedback amplification loop that promotes tumor growth and invasive behavior. The researchers found that interfering with this amplification loop significantly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and improves organismal survival.

     The study reveals that caspases can adopt a tumor-promoting role under certain conditions, such as in the presence of oncogenic RasV12 in scrib mutant cells. This is in contrast to their traditional role as tumor suppressors. The researchers also found that the tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases is dependent on the generation of intra- and extracellular ROS, which are required for neoplastic behavior of scrib−/− RasV12 clones.

     The study provides new insights into the complex relationship between apoptosis, caspases, and tumor growth, and highlights the importance of ROS in promoting tumor growth and invasive behavior. The findings have implications for our understanding of cancer biology and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.
Biomedical research has shown that the way we perceive social interactions can influence our subjective experience of time. Specifically, studies have found that people tend to perceive social interactions as shorter in duration compared to non-social interactions. This phenomenon, known as temporal compression, is more pronounced in individuals with higher social cognitive competency. However, individuals with autistic-like tendencies exhibit a weaker temporal compression effect, suggesting that social proficiency plays a role in this phenomenon.

    Further investigation revealed that intranasal oxytocin administration can restore the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings suggest that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, supporting its role in human social cognition.

    The study also highlighted the idiosyncrasy of subjective time for social interactions, which is tied to a stable personality trait – social proficiency. Autistic traits have been associated with reduced levels of oxytocin, and intranasal oxytocin administration has been shown to ameliorate these traits. The link between autistic-like tendency and subjective duration of social interactions raises the question of whether oxytocin plays a role in this phenomenon.

    Experiments were conducted to investigate the relationship between oxytocin and the temporal compression effect. The results showed that socially less proficient individuals, who have lower levels of endogenous oxytocin, are less susceptible to the temporal compression effect compared to socially proficient individuals. The administration of oxytocin promoted the social interaction-induced temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, while the administration of atosiban diminished the effect in socially proficient individuals.

    These findings indicate that perceived time is not a faithful representation of physical time, but rather is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one’s personality trait. The study provides evidence for the role of oxytocin in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting its involvement in human social cognition. The results have implications for our understanding of social cognition and the neural mechanisms underlying time perception.
Summary
     The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is essential for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that have emerged independently worldwide. This study investigated the effects of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction.

The researchers analyzed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P1) variants. The results showed that most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, with the exceptions being mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. The N501Y and S477N mutations were found to enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, while the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape.

The study also examined the effect on ACE2 binding of combinations of RBD mutations, including combinations present in VOC-202102–02, a subset of the Alpha lineage (N501Y) with the E484K mutation, and the Beta and Gamma variants. The results suggest that the increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD of the K26R and S19P ACE2 mutants is less clear, but carriers of these ACE2 variants may be at greater risk of infection and/or severe disease.

The study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of RBD and ACE2 mutations on the Spike/ACE2 interaction to assess the extent to which RBD mutations have been selected because they enhance ACE2 binding or facilitate immune evasion. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and disease severity, which can inform public health strategies to mitigate the spread of the virus.
Scientists have developed a large-scale map of genetic interactions in Drosophila cells, which reveals the complex relationships between genes and their effects on cellular processes. This map, generated using a combination of RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping, includes 1367 genes involved in key biological processes such as signaling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation, and protein turnover control. The researchers used this map to identify directional genetic interactions, which reflect regulatory relationships between genes, and found that these interactions can be used to reconstruct the sequence of protein activities during mitosis.

The study also revealed an unexpected link between chromatin remodeling and RAS signaling, with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex interacting with the RAS pathway. This interaction was found to be conserved in human cancer cells, suggesting that it may play a role in cancer development. The researchers used a method that combines genetic interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships, which allowed them to reconstruct a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal, and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle.

The study provides a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and offers a resource for interpreting the functional consequences of genetic alterations. The map of genetic interactions can be used to identify regulatory relationships between genes and to predict the effects of mutations on cellular processes. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of the complex relationships between genes and their effects on cellular processes, and may lead to new insights into the development of cancer and other diseases.

The researchers used a combination of high-throughput imaging of single-cell phenotypes and modeling of gene-gene interactions to generate the map of genetic interactions. They selected 1367 genes implicated in key biological processes and quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cultured cells using automated imaging. The study demonstrates that directional genetic interactions can be identified at a large scale and mapped to other genomic data sets to identify regulatory relationships. The findings of this study provide a new resource for understanding the complex relationships between genes and their effects on cellular processes, and may lead to new insights into the development of cancer and other diseases.
summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding the genetic basis of heterostyly, a widespread floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding in plants. Heterostyly is characterized by the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between different morphs. In the genus Primula, also known as primroses, heterostyly is controlled by the S-locus supergene, which determines the style-length dimorphism. However, the identities of the component genes remained unknown until now.

     Researchers have identified the CYP734A50 gene as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism in Primula. This gene encodes a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme and is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype. CYP734A50 is specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution.

     The presence or absence of CYP734A50 strictly cosegregates with the morph type in all heterostylous species sampled across the Primula phylogeny. The gene is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly. This strongly supports the conclusion that CYP734A50 is the G locus of the Primula heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism.

     The discovery of CYP734A50 provides a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene. The CYP734A50 gene is a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism. This finding opens the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus, which is an iconic case of a complex supergene.

     Heterostyly evolved only once in the genus Primula, and the same causal genes should co-segregate with morph phenotypes in all heterostylous Primula species. The researchers sequenced style transcriptomes of the distantly related Primula species and found that CYP734A50 is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly. This supports the conclusion that CYP734A50 is the G locus of the Primula heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism.
summary
     Biomedical research has identified the role of kisspeptin (Kiss1) and neurokinin B (NKB) neurocircuits in pubertal development and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (Kiss1ARH) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin, and glutamate, and are thought to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 (GnRH) neurons. Using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice, researchers characterized the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal activity.

     High-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons was found to evoke the local release of excitatory (NKB) and inhibitory (dynorphin) neuropeptides, which synchronized the firing of Kiss1ARH neurons. This synchronized activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons through a synaptic mechanism involving glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons. The researchers propose that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role in driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.

     The study found that high-frequency photoactivation of Kiss1ARH neurons induced a NKB-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which was modulated by co-released dynorphin, and caused synchronization of Kiss1ARH neurons. Additionally, activation of Kiss1ARH neurons co-released glutamate, which excited rostral Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. The combination of synchronization and unified excitation of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons resulted in robust excitation of GnRH neurons.

     Kiss1ARH neurons communicate with Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via the fast neurotransmitter glutamate, which stimulates burst-firing of Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons. Activation of these rostral Kiss1 neurons releases kisspeptin to robustly excite GnRH neurons via activation of the GPR54 signaling cascade, thereby stimulating the release of GnRH at the time of the preovulatory surge. Kisspeptin, GPR54, NKB, Tacr3, and GnRH are all required for normal fertility. The study suggests that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role in driving pulsatile (episodic) secretion of GnRH through kisspeptin release into the external zone of the median eminence, but also excite Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via glutamate release to help generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH through a robust di-synaptic pathway.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining the pluripotency of cells, which are capable of differentiating into various cell types. However, the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. A recent study has shed light on this process, revealing that BMP signalling suppresses differentiation by maintaining the expression of E-Cadherin (Cdh1), a protein involved in cell adhesion.

     The study found that the loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. This suggests that Cdh1 plays a critical role in the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. Furthermore, the study showed that BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thereby reinforcing the block to neural differentiation.

     BMP signalling is known to contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. The study proposes that BMP suppresses differentiation by maintaining Cdh1 expression, which interferes with efficient neural and mesodermal differentiation. Higher levels of BMP also impose a posterior identity that primes cells for mesoderm and is incompatible with a neural fate. This finding helps to explain why BMP can simultaneously protect pluripotency and promote mesoderm differentiation.

     The study also identified the BMP target gene Id1, which imposes a proximal posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards mesoderm. This suggests that the ability of Id1 to block neural differentiation is not due to inhibition of a neural-inducing transcription factor or direct activation of mesoderm differentiation, but rather to a shift in the positional identity of pluripotent cells.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which BMP signalling controls differentiation, highlighting the importance of Cdh1 in maintaining pluripotency and the role of Id1 in priming cells for mesoderm differentiation. These findings contribute to our understanding of the complex events that drive the transition from pluripotency to lineage commitment.
Biomedical researchers have identified a novel mechanism that regulates the maturation of centrioles in quiescent cells. Centrioles are crucial components of the centrosome, a structure that plays a key role in cell division and cilia formation. In quiescent cells, the two centrioles are inherently asymmetric, differing in age, morphology, and function. However, the underlying mechanisms that establish and maintain these asymmetric properties during quiescence were previously unknown.

The study found that a protein called Cep120, which is associated with the daughter centriole, plays a critical inhibitory role in regulating centriole maturation. Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent mouse and human cells led to an accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein, and Cep170. This accumulation resulted in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome, leading to aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling.

The researchers demonstrated that Cep120 helps maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting the untimely maturation of the daughter centriole. Loss of Cep120 initiated a series of changes in protein localization and abundance that ultimately resulted in defective ciliary assembly and function. The study also showed that Cep120 regulates the asymmetric distribution of PCM proteins at the centrosome by residing on the outer wall of the centriolar microtubules.

The findings suggest that loss of Cep120 during quiescence is detrimental to ciliary assembly and function, likely due to aberrant CS-dependent trafficking of proteins to the centrosome. The researchers propose that dispersal of centriolar satellites upon Cep120 loss disrupts the formation and/or function of cilia during quiescence. The study establishes the importance of Cep120 in maintaining centrosome homeostasis and its relationship to primary cilium assembly and signaling. The results also uncover a potentially new type of molecular defect that may underlie the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that communication between neurons and glial cells, specifically Müller glial cells (MCs), plays a crucial role in the maturation of neural circuits in the developing central nervous system (CNS). A recent study investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina, where it was found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in MCs. The study used a combination of whole-cell recordings and two-photon imaging to examine the spatio-temporal characteristics and molecular pathways of neuron-glia interactions in the developing retina.

The results showed that retinal waves were correlated with calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, indicating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. The study also found that the mechanism of interaction between neurons and MCs during cholinergic retinal waves is similar to previous findings in the visual cortex and hippocampus, where cholinergic neuron stimulation leads to astrocyte calcium transients via activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.

Furthermore, the study demonstrated that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptor types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal synchronization shifts from being dependent on cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling. The proportion of MCs that responded to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly from postnatal day 9 (P9) to P11, despite the presence of retinal waves.

The study used an optical glutamate sensor to show that the decline in MC calcium transients is caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. This suggests that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of neuron-glia interactions in the developing retina and highlight the importance of neurotransmitter spillover in enabling communication between neurons and glial cells.
summary
     Establishing the postmortem interval (PMI), the time elapsed since death, is crucial in death investigations. However, current methods, such as forensic entomology, are prone to errors and biases. Researchers have explored the potential of microbes to estimate PMI, as they undergo significant changes during decomposition. A recent study used a mouse model system to investigate the feasibility of using microbial communities to estimate PMI.

     The study involved 40 mouse corpses, which were decomposed on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days. Microbial communities, including bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes, were analyzed using high-throughput DNA sequencing. The results showed that postmortem microbial community changes were dramatic, measurable, and repeatable, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over 48 days.

     This study expands on previous research by Pechal et al. (2013), which demonstrated that skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of three swine corpses over 5 days. The current study characterizes microbial community change in three external sites and one internal site in mouse corpses, providing a more comprehensive understanding of microbial ecology during decomposition.

     The study's findings suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI. The results provide a detailed understanding of the underlying microbial ecology of corpse decomposition and the feasibility of using microbes as evidence. The study's approach differs from previous work, which evaluated regression models by their ability to explain variation in all data points. Instead, the current study provides a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimating PMI.

     The study's results have significant implications for the field of forensic science, as they provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids many of the limitations of existing techniques. The use of microbial communities as a "clock" to estimate PMI has the potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of death investigations. Further research is needed to validate and refine this approach, but the current study provides a promising foundation for the development of a microbial-based forensic tool.
Despite the vast diversity of body forms in nature, bilaterian animals share common sets of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo. One such set of genes is the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior-posterior axis. Hox proteins interact with TALE transcription factors to exert their function. The presence of Hox and TALE members in some, but not all, non-bilaterian phyla raises the question of how Hox-TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information.

     Research has shown that Hox-TALE networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. This ancestral regulatory module was later exploited for patterning functions in bilaterians. The network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing for diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. This original molecular system was subsequently co-opted by the various contexts of embryogenesis in different eumetazoan phyla for axis or tissue patterning.

     Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Although these networks rely on intricate molecular properties, they originated from an ancestral generic mode of interaction that was kept in other homeobox gene families.

     The study found that developmental genes can display highly dissimilar expression patterns or be absent in non-bilaterian lineages, showing that the genetic mechanisms underlying embryonic development are not universal. Interestingly, Cnidaria is the only non-bilaterian phylum with a bona fide Hox repertoire, whereas others lack Hox genes. This raises the question of how the Hox gene family acquired its crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution.

     In bilaterians, Hox patterning functions rely on the presence of PBC and Meis proteins, which are also present in non-bilaterian phyla. The study suggests that Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was later exploited for patterning functions in bilaterians. This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing for diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. Overall, the study describes how the molecular cues underlying the Hox-TALE patterning system in bilaterians were established stepwise during eukaryote evolution.
Using super-resolution microscopy, researchers examined how the size of fluorescent probes affects the tracking of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at synapses. AMPARs are a type of glutamate receptor that plays a crucial role in synaptic transmission. The study aimed to investigate the dynamics of AMPARs within and outside of post-synaptic densities (PSDs) in rat neurons.

The researchers used different-sized fluorescent probes, including organic dyes, small quantum dots (sQDs), and large quantum dots (bQDs), to label AMPARs. They found that when using sQDs, approximately 90% of AMPARs were diffusing in confined nanodomains within PSDs, which remained stable for 15 minutes or longer. In contrast, less than 10% of sQDs-labeled AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile.

In contrast, when using bQDs, 5-10% of AMPARs were found within PSDs, while 90-95% were extrasynaptic. This suggests that bQDs may be too large to allow AMPARs to enter the synaptic cleft. The study's findings contradict the hypothesis that AMPAR entry is limited by the occupancy of open PSD "slots." Instead, the researchers propose that AMPARs rapidly enter stable nanodomains within PSDs, which have a lifetime of over 15 minutes, and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes.

The study used super-resolution microscopy to track the dynamics of AMPARs in synapses for extended periods, up to 60 minutes. The results were consistent across different labeling techniques, including sparse labeling with sQDs and organic dyes on live neurons. The researchers observed that the localization of AMPARs is predominantly at synaptic regions, with one nanodomain per synapse, although multiple nanodomains can exist.

The study's findings have implications for understanding the regulation of synaptic transmission and the role of AMPARs in synaptic plasticity. The results suggest that the size of the fluorescent probe used to label AMPARs can significantly impact the observed dynamics of these receptors, highlighting the importance of careful consideration of probe size when studying synaptic receptors.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia, an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (INa). A recent study has identified the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway as a key mediator of this response. The study found that hypoxia activates the SUMO pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and that SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels increases INa. The time-course for SUMOylation of single NaV1.2 channels at the cell surface and changes in INa coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of NaV1.2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme. Within 40 seconds, hypoxia-induced linkage of SUMO1 to the channels is complete, shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. The study suggests that the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions, given the recognized role of INa in hypoxic brain damage.

The study used rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and CHO cells to investigate the response of NaV1.2 channels to hypoxia. The researchers found that hypoxia-induced SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the immediate increase in INa in response to acute hypoxia. The time-course of SUMOylation of Lys38 matches the increase in NaV1.2 currents observed when CHO cells are subjected to hypoxia. The study also found that hypoxia-mediated SUMOylation of NaV1.2 is observed in the presence of TTX, showing that Na+ flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMOylation.

Consistent with tonic control of INa by the SUMO pathway, SUMO1 and SENP1 increased and decreased the current, respectively, under normoxic conditions. The response of INa to hypoxia was ablated by µ-Conotoxin-TIIIA (CnTX), a potent blocker of NaV1.2 channels. Supporting the implied mechanism, hypoxia was directly shown to increase the interaction of native SUMO1 and NaV1.2 channels. The study suggests that NaV1.2 channels and SUMO pathway enzymes may be valuable therapeutic targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons.

     Biomedical researchers investigated the relationship between beta oscillations in the motor cortex and movement onset in three macaques performing a novel neurofeedback task. The study aimed to understand how changes in population neural activity, beta oscillations, and behavior are linked. The researchers recorded multi-scale neural activity from the motor cortex while the macaques performed the task, which involved bringing their beta oscillatory power to an instructed state and subsequently executing an arm reach.

     The results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Additionally, population neural activity was found to shift farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. This finding establishes a population neural basis for slowed movement onset following periods of beta oscillatory activity.

     Notably, this shift in neural population was also seen in naturally occurring beta oscillations during reaching tasks, suggesting that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts. The study ties together existing works on behavioral correlates of beta oscillations with hypotheses of how the motor cortex encodes movement onset through the lens of population-level neural activity.

     The study's results support the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow the onset of new movements. The behavioral effect from neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations matches well with hypotheses claiming a movement-slowing role of beta oscillations during natural movements. However, individual unit responses during beta activity were found to be different across tasks.

     The researchers analyzed simultaneously recorded units and showed that they exhibited different activity during neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations compared with natural beta oscillations occurring during typical reaching tasks. Despite differences at an individual unit level, population-level analyses show that beta oscillations promote a consistent movement-slowing state during both the CO and NR tasks, matching what is observed behaviorally. This study provides new insights into the relationship between beta oscillations and movement onset, shedding light on the neural mechanisms underlying motor control.
summary
     TRAF2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation and homeostasis of immune cells. It is a component of the TNF superfamily signalling complexes and is essential for the proper functioning of the immune system. However, the role of TRAF2 in adult tissues is not well understood due to the fact that TRAF2-deficient mice die shortly after birth.

     Researchers have investigated the function of TRAF2 in keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, and found that its absence leads to the disruption of TNF-mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling pathways. This disruption causes epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation in mice. The inflammation is driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB, and the adaptive immune system, making it a clinically relevant model of psoriasis.

     The study found that TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes are sensitive to killing by TNF and have a delayed response to TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and MAPK. The absence of TRAF2 also leads to the production of inflammatory cytokines via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway, which ultimately generates a psoriasis-like phenotype in mice. This phenotype is characterized by the recruitment of inflammatory immune cells, including neutrophils and IFNγ+ T cells, to the skin.

     The researchers were able to reverse the inflammatory phenotype by simultaneously deleting both TNF and NF-κB2 genes. This suggests that TRAF2 plays a crucial role in protecting keratinocytes from cell death and down-regulating inflammatory responses. The study also found that TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes do not need to be stimulated by bacteria to produce TNF, and TNF-induced death sets up a potentially vicious cycle of inflammation.

     In contrast, the absence of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1), an enzyme involved in the generation of sphingosine-1-phosphate, does not disrupt TNF-mediated signalling pathways in keratinocytes. This suggests that TRAF2 has essential tissue-specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sphk1. Overall, the study highlights the importance of TRAF2 in regulating inflammation and cell death in keratinocytes and provides new insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis.
summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of synaptic vesicles (SVs) in storing and secreting neurotransmitters at synapses. Following exocytosis, SV membranes are rapidly recaptured by endocytosis and recycled for the generation of new fusion-competent SVs. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) has been proposed to play a key role in this endocytic traffic. However, a recent study has shed light on an alternative pathway of SV recycling that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3.

Using synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons, where CME is dramatically impaired, researchers found that massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin-coated buds on their surface and proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin.

These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that operates during intense synaptic activity and bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3. This pathway involves bulk endocytosis of SV membranes leading to the formation of large endocytic vacuoles, which then disappear in parallel with the reappearance of new SVs. The study's results demonstrate that neither dynamin 1 nor dynamin 3 is required for bulk endocytosis and that their absence delays, but does not abolish, SV reformation from internal membranes.

Ultrastructural analysis of the time course of SV recovery from bulk endosomes in the presence or near depletion of clathrin revealed that the conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs proceeded independently of clathrin. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the mechanisms underlying synaptic vesicle recycling and suggest that multiple pathways may exist for the reformation of SVs during intense synaptic activity. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this alternative pathway of SV recycling.
biomedical researchers conducted a clinical study to identify biomarkers of glucocorticoid (GC) action in humans. Glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed medications, but there is currently no reliable way to measure their effects on the body. The study involved 10 participants with primary adrenal insufficiency, a condition where the adrenal glands do not produce enough glucocorticoids. The participants were admitted to a clinic and underwent a randomized crossover trial, where they received either a normal dose of glucocorticoids or no glucocorticoids for a period of time. The researchers collected blood and tissue samples from the participants before, during, and after the trial to analyze the effects of glucocorticoids on their bodies.

     The researchers used a multi-omic approach, combining data from gene expression in blood cells, adipose tissue, circulating microRNAs, and metabolites to identify potential biomarkers of glucocorticoid action. They found that a specific transcriptomic profile in both blood cells and adipose tissue was predictive of glucocorticoid exposure. Additionally, they identified a microRNA called miR-122-5p that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoids. This microRNA was also found to be associated with glucocorticoid exposure in independent studies with varying levels of glucocorticoid exposure.

     The researchers validated their findings by comparing the results to previously published data from cellular assays and found that the transcriptomic profile and miR-122-5p were consistently associated with glucocorticoid exposure. Two participants did not show the expected response to glucocorticoids, which may be related to their individual characteristics, such as disease duration and body mass index. The study suggests that miR-122-5p may be a potential biomarker for glucocorticoid action and could be used to individualize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy. The findings also provide insights into the effects of unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure on disease etiology, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity. The study was funded by several organizations, including the Swedish Research Council and the Wellcome Trust.

     Biomedical research has shed light on the dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids. Amino acids are essential activators of mTORC1, a complex containing RAG GTPases, RAGULATOR, and the vacuolar ATPase. The sensing of amino acids triggers the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes, a crucial step for its activation. Live imaging of the mTORC1 component RAPTOR and a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester revealed that translocation to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaking within 5 minutes. This translocation is temporally coupled with the appearance of fluorescent leucine in lysosomes and is sustained compared to amino acid stimulation. The study also found that Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTORC1 activity, respectively. Notably, phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere. The research used HAP-1 cells and a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of leucine to image RAPTOR translocation in response to this compound. Leucine has a prominent role in mTORC1 activation, and a leucine methyl ester that enters cells and accumulates in lysosomes can activate mTORC1 on its own. The study suggests that the lysosome is a crucial locus for mTOR activation, but the dynamics of this process and how mTORC1 activity is connected to lysosomal residence may be more complicated than current models. The research provides a dynamic view of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids, supporting the idea that amino acids ultimately activate mTORC1 in the cell interior, and that more than one type of sensing (and amino acid) is involved. Sestrin1/2 proteins sense leucine, while levels of arginine entering the lysosomes via transporter SLC38A9 are also important for mTORC1 activation.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered that modifying the glycan structure of an antigen, such as Ovalbumin (OVA), can alter its intracellular routing in dendritic cells and promote the priming of T cells. Specifically, the addition of the LewisX (LeX) glycan structure to OVA re-directs it to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. This modification enhances the cross-presentation of OVA to CD8+ T cells and favors the differentiation of naive CD4+ T cells into Th1 cells, which produce interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α).

     The study found that the LeX-modified OVA (OVA-LeX) is taken up by dendritic cells and stored in Rab11+LAMP1+ compartments, where it is presented to CD8+ T cells without the need for TAP-transporters or Cathepsin-S. This cross-presentation pathway is independent of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling and can occur at low antigen doses. In contrast, the cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen doses and TLR stimuli.

     The researchers used MGL1-deficient mice to demonstrate that MGL1 is the primary lectin involved in the cross-presentation of OVA-LeX. Immunization of MGL1-deficient mice with OVA-LeX did not enhance the frequency of OVA-specific CD8+ effector T cells, whereas wild-type mice immunized with OVA-LeX showed increased CD8+ T cell responses.

     The study suggests that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can influence the intracellular routing of antigens, the nature, and strength of immune responses. The findings have implications for optimizing current vaccination strategies, as the conjugation of LeX glycans to antigens may enhance the efficacy of vaccines by promoting CD8+ T cell priming and Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a novel mechanism by which certain bacteria, Burkholderia thailandensis, control the growth of mutants that are unable to communicate with each other through a process called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing is a system used by many bacteria to regulate gene expression based on the density of their population. In B. thailandensis, quorum sensing is mediated by acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) signals, which are produced by the LuxI family of signal synthases. These signals can diffuse between cells and trigger the expression of hundreds of genes.

     The researchers found that one of the genes regulated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis is involved in the production of type VI secretion system (T6SS) toxins and immunity proteins. T6SS is a cell-contact-dependent system that allows bacteria to kill or inhibit the growth of neighboring cells. The study showed that when B. thailandensis cells are able to communicate with each other through quorum sensing, they produce T6SS toxins and immunity proteins that inhibit the growth of mutants that are unable to communicate.

     The researchers also found that when B. thailandensis cells are grown in liquid broth, the quorum-sensing mutants have a significant growth advantage over the wild-type cells. However, when the cells are grown on an agar surface, the wild-type cells are able to outcompete the quorum-sensing mutants. This is because the T6SS toxins and immunity proteins are only effective when the cells are in close contact with each other, which is more likely to occur on an agar surface.

     The study suggests that quorum sensing plays a crucial role in controlling the growth of quorum-sensing mutants in B. thailandensis populations. By producing T6SS toxins and immunity proteins, quorum-sensing competent cells are able to "police" the population and prevent the growth of mutants that are unable to communicate. This mechanism is thought to be important for maintaining the health and stability of bacterial populations. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between bacteria and their environment, and highlights the importance of quorum sensing in regulating bacterial behavior.

     Biomedical researchers have identified a new type of post-translational modification of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in mammalian cells. Specifically, they found that certain lysine residues in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII can be mono- or di-methylated (K7me1 and K7me2). These modifications occur during the earliest stages of transcription, preceding or coinciding with the phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 5 and 7 in the CTD.

     The study used novel antibodies to detect K7me1 and K7me2 and found that these modifications are present at the promoters of genes that are actively transcribed into mature RNA. However, the presence of K7me1 and K7me2 is associated with less productive transcription, whereas acetylation of the same lysine residues (K7ac) is linked to higher levels of gene expression. The researchers also observed that the extent of productive transcription at active genes is modulated by the balance between K7 methylation and acetylation.

     The study used biochemical and genome-wide approaches to investigate the role of K7 methylation in transcription. They found that K7me1 and K7me2 are detected primarily in the hypophosphorylated forms of RNAPII, suggesting that these modifications are associated with early stages of the transcription cycle. In contrast, K7ac is enriched at the highest expressed genes.

     The researchers also explored the functional significance of K7 methylation by mutating the lysine residues in the CTD of RNAPII. They found that these mutations are compatible with the viability of mouse fibroblasts, suggesting that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of gene expression in mammalian cells and highlights the importance of post-translational modifications in modulating the activity of RNAPII. The findings suggest that the balance between K7 methylation and acetylation plays a critical role in regulating the extent of productive transcription at active genes.

     Biomedical research has shed light on the mechanisms governing the quiescence of skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs), which are crucial for muscle repair and regeneration. Satellite cells reside in a quiescent state in their niche, but upon muscle injury, they exit quiescence, proliferate, and self-renew to replenish the SC population. To understand the regulatory mechanisms involved in maintaining SC quiescence, researchers identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during SC activation following muscle injury. The study found that transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins, including the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin (TTP), were among the most significantly changed.

TTP promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment. Upon SC activation, p38α/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates TTP, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. This leads to the accumulation of MyoD, differentiation, and cell fusion into myofibers. Satellite cell-specific knockdown of TTP precociously activates SCs in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation, and cell fusion into myofibers. The regulation of mRNAs by TTP appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling SC homeostasis.

The study proposes that TTP may be involved in down-regulating MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts expressed by myoblasts, during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in reacquisition of quiescence following an injury. The rapid p38α/β MAPK-dependent phosphorylation (inactivation) of TTP upon SC activation suggests that TTP plays a role in maintaining SC quiescence. Furthermore, TTP inactivation preceding MyoD up-regulation is consistent with the hypothesis that TTP actively suppresses pro-myogenic mRNA targets.

The research highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis, with transcripts encoding proteins that directly regulate mRNAs, including mRNA binding proteins involved in skeletal muscle diseases, being highly represented. The study suggests that TTP may be required for SC quiescence, as it is present in quiescent SCs, rapidly inhibited by p38α/β MAPK signaling within minutes of SC activation, and reduces the half-life of MyoD mRNA. Loss of TTP from skeletal muscle tissue should precociously activate SCs, promoting inappropriate MyoD expression and aberrant cell cycle entry.

     Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 receptor (IL10R) are prone to developing very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Researchers investigated whether IL10R regulates lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy. The study found that signs of colitis were absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, but intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction began during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and changes in the intestinal microbiota. Macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is crucial for preventing the development of murine colitis.

The study used detailed time-series experiments to evaluate histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the lamina propria, and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks of age in IL10R-deficient infant mice and their littermate controls. The results suggest that IL10R does not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Instead, the study found that macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy. The requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling.

Previous studies have shown that the IL10/IL10R pathway is essential for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and prevention of intestinal inflammation in infancy. Modeling infantile-onset colitis in mice that lack functional IL10R signaling could lead to significant advances in our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases. The study's findings highlight the importance of IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period in preventing the development of murine colitis.
Summary
     Biologists have identified a protein called SIMR-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in the regulation of transposons and other germline genes. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that can jump from one location to another in the genome, and their regulation is essential for maintaining genome stability. SIMR-1 is a Tudor domain protein that acts downstream of the piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) pathway and upstream of the mutator complex, which is responsible for synthesizing secondary siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) from piRNA-targeted mRNAs.

The researchers found that SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, which are phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. This suggests that multiple perinuclear condensates are involved in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex.

SIMR-1 is thought to function similarly to Krimper, a protein that coordinates Ago3 and Aubergine during ping-pong piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila. The researchers propose that SIMR-1 bridges the gap between the primary and secondary phases of the C. elegans piRNA silencing pathway.

The study also identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex. Furthermore, the researchers suggest that multiple perinuclear condensates, including P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci, are involved in the regulation of mRNAs by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.

In C. elegans, a small RNA amplification pathway dependent on the mutator complex synthesizes secondary downstream siRNAs from piRNA-targeted mRNAs to trigger robust and heritable silencing. Several proteins, including GLH-1, DDX-19, LAF-1, MUT-14, and VBH-1, localize at or near P granules and could potentially serve a function similar to RDE-12 in the shuttling of piRNA-targeted mRNAs into SIMR-1 foci and ultimately to Mutator foci. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of transposons and other germline genes in C. elegans and highlights the importance of multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation.

Biomedical researchers have investigated the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where cells internalize substances by forming vesicles from the cell membrane. A key component of this process is the actin cytoskeleton, a dynamic network of protein filaments that generates forces to shape the membrane. Using a combination of experiments and computer simulations, the study reveals how the actin cytoskeleton self-organizes and adapts to internalize endocytic pits against the tension of the cell membrane.

The researchers developed a multiscale model that integrates membrane mechanics and actin polymerization to simulate the process of endocytosis. They found that a minimal branched actin network, composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein, is sufficient to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension. The actin network self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented towards the base of the pit, and long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit.

Elastic energy stored in bent filaments contributes to endocytic internalization, and elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments towards the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. The study used a newly developed molecule-counting method to determine that approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells.

The researchers also used cryo-electron tomography to confirm the presence of bent filaments in the actin network. They found that spatially constrained actin filament assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints. In cells with low membrane tension, endocytosis can occur even with low Arp2/3 complex activity, whereas in cells with high membrane tension, more Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the principles of self-organization and load adaptation by the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The findings suggest that the actin network can adapt to changing loads by self-organizing into a radial branched array and utilizing elastic energy stored in bent filaments to generate sufficient force for endocytic internalization.
Summary
     Macropinocytosis is a cellular process that allows cells to take up large amounts of extracellular fluid into large vesicles called macropinosomes. The formation of macropinosomes depends on the creation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. Research has shown that in Dictyostelium cells, macropinocytic cups are formed around patches of active Ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate ( PIP3 ). These patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, which drives the formation of a hollow ring of actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup.

     The study used lattice light sheet microscopy to examine the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators and signalling molecules during macropinocytosis. The results suggest that macropinocytic cups form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. This process does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring, and the patches become enlarged when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, indicating that Ras plays an instructive role in the formation of macropinocytic cups.

     Macropinosomes develop from cup-shaped projections of the plasma membrane, whose walls are driven outwards by actin polymerization. The central patch of activated Ras and PIP3 is associated with a ring of active SCAR at its edge, which drives the formation of a hollow ring of F-actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup. New macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones, and the F-actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signalling molecules, such as active Ras.

     The study also found that circular ruffles can persist on the cell surface for prolonged periods before either closing successfully or regressing back into the cell body. The closure of the cup can be abrupt and often involves the inward collapse of the rim. The research suggests that Ras activity stimulates macropinocytosis in both mammalian and Dictyostelium cells, and macropinocytic cups are associated with an intense domain of PIP3, which is essential for their function. The study proposes a new hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane, where self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3 recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery.

     The cohesin ring is a crucial protein complex that holds together newly replicated sister chromatids in eukaryotic cells until their separation at anaphase. A separate complex, Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 (Scc2/4), is responsible for loading cohesin onto DNA and determining its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and defects in this process can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, resulting in severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms.

     Researchers have determined the crystal structure of the interaction between Scc2 and Scc4, revealing that Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. Using budding yeast, they demonstrated that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and build pericentromeric cohesion. This finding shows that Scc4 plays a key role in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establishes a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres.

     The study also shows that Scc4 targets cohesin loading to a specific genomic locus and that this function is separable from its essential role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome. The researchers used separation of function alleles to uncouple cohesin loading from cohesin targeting to centromeres, demonstrating that cohesin targeting in yeast depends on Scc4. This finding is consistent with unpublished genetic evidence for an Scc4-dependent cohesin localization pathway.

     Further experiments revealed that perturbation of the conserved patch on Scc4 eliminates centromeric localization of Scc2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of the cohesin subunit, Scc1, with the centromere and pericentromere, but not with chromosome arms. This suggests that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting pathway is a general feature of the control of cohesin loading, conserved across diverse eukaryotes. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cohesin loading and localization, which is essential for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division.

Summary
     Scientists have long known that ADAR proteins play a crucial role in altering gene expression by converting adenosine to inosine in RNA. This process, known as A-to-I editing, is essential for proper neuronal function in all animals studied to date. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the loss of ADARs leads to reduced chemotaxis, or the ability to move towards chemical stimuli. However, the specific targets of ADARs responsible for this phenotype have remained unknown.

     To identify critical neural ADAR targets in C. elegans, researchers performed an unbiased assessment of the effects of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome. Using publicly available software, SAILOR, they identified 7361 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome. By intersecting the neural editome with gene expression changes associated with ADR-2, the researchers revealed an edited mRNA, clec-41, whose neural expression is dependent on deamination.

     Further investigation showed that restoring clec-41 expression in ADR-2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing the first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of ADAR mutants can be caused by altered gene expression. This study is the first to link a phenotype associated with loss of C. elegans ADAR enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene.

     The study also provided the first analysis of the tissue-specific role of ADR-2, both in A-to-I editing and in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans. Combining neural cell isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing site detection with SAILOR, the researchers identified over 7300 A-to-I editing sites in the C. elegans neural transcriptome, including 104 novel edited genes. These findings suggest that ADR-2 plays a critical role in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans, and that altered gene expression, rather than recoding events, is responsible for the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C. elegans ADAR enzymes.

     The Influenza A virus (IAV) employs a common strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation and promote the efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Using RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling, researchers investigated the mechanisms behind IAV-induced host shutoff. The results show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, and instead, the decline in cellular protein synthesis is primarily due to the viral takeover of the mRNA pool.

The analysis reveals that the translation efficiency of viral genes falls within the general range of host gene translation, indicating that direct co-opting of the translation machinery does not play a dominant role in cellular gene shutoff. Instead, host shutoff stems from the viral dominance over the mRNA pool. At 8 hours post-infection (hpi), viral mRNAs take over 53.8% of the translation activity in the cells, while 57.3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral.

Interestingly, the study found that short transcripts are less affected by IAV infection, and these mRNAs are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is essential for viral propagation. The results suggest that IAV-induced shutoff facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions.

The findings contradict previous suggestions that IAV employs mechanisms such as cap-snatching, inhibition of cellular pre-mRNAs polyadenylation, and PA-X endonuclease activity to induce host shutoff. Instead, the study's systematic and unbiased analysis reveals that viral mRNAs are not preferentially translated compared to their host counterparts, and the extensive translation of viral proteins is the result of viral takeover of the mRNA pool in the cell. These results are consistent with the notion that NS1 is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of IAV-induced host shutoff and highlights the importance of oxidative phosphorylation in viral propagation.
Biomedical researchers have long understood the importance of signaling protein gradients in guiding tissue development, but the mechanisms behind their formation have remained unclear. A recent study in Drosophila (fruit flies) has shed light on how these gradients are generated and maintained. The study focused on the Branchless (Bnl) protein, a member of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family, which plays a crucial role in the development of tracheal epithelial tubes in Drosophila.

Traditionally, it was thought that paracrine signals like Bnl diffuse through the extracellular space to form a gradient, guiding the directional migration of tracheal branches. However, this study found that Bnl is transported through specialized structures called cytonemes, which extend from the air-sac-primordium (ASP) to the wing disc, where Bnl is produced. The number of cytonemes decreases with increasing distance from the source, generating a gradient of Bnl that is specific to the recipient tissue.

The study used fluorescently-tagged Bnl and its receptor, FGFR, expressed at physiological levels in Drosophila larvae. The results showed that Bnl produced in the wing disc moves through FGFR-containing cytonemes to the ASP, where it activates concentration-dependent gene expression. The transcription factors Pointed-P1 and Cut, which antagonize each other, differentially regulate the formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of Bnl-receiving cytonemes.

This feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport allows the Bnl gradient to self-generate precise tissue-specific contours. The study demonstrates that morphogens like Bnl can dynamically adapt to diverse tissue morphologies, providing precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of tissue development and morphogenesis, and highlight the importance of cytoneme-mediated signaling in generating complex tissue patterns.

Summary
     Epsin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of endocytosis, which is the uptake of molecules into cells through the formation of vesicles. Endocytosis is essential for various cellular functions, including nutrient uptake, cell signaling, and waste removal. However, the exact function of epsin in endocytosis has remained elusive.

     To investigate the role of epsin in endocytosis, researchers generated embryonic fibroblasts from mice lacking all three epsin proteins (epsin triple knockout, or TKO). These cells displayed a significant defect in cell division and a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin-coated pits, which are the precursors to endocytic vesicles, accumulated and failed to invaginate properly in epsin TKO cells.

     The researchers found that epsin helps to couple the clathrin coat to the actin cytoskeleton, which is essential for the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits. In a cell-free assay, they confirmed that epsin is required for the proper coupling between the clathrin coat and actin. This suggests that epsin generates the force necessary for the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits.

     The study also revealed a weak interaction between epsin's ENTH domain and the SNARE protein synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2, which is involved in vesicle fusion. However, the researchers found that epsin's most critical function is at the transition between shallow and deep invaginated pits, rather than in the fusion process.

     The findings of this study provide conclusive evidence for the role of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and highlight the importance of epsin in generating the force necessary for the invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits. The study also suggests that epsin's function is distinct from other endocytic proteins, such as clathrin, which have been implicated in the organization of mitotic scaffolds. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of endocytosis and the role of epsin in this process.

     Biomedical research has shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the striped pattern in adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). The striped pattern is a result of interactions between three types of pigment cells: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. Mutations in the leopard (leo) gene, which encodes Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a series of spotted patterns in zebrafish. A new dominant allele, leotK3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions.

     Further investigation identified Connexin 39.4 (Cx39.4), encoded by the luchs gene, as the additional component. Loss-of-function alleles of luchs demonstrate that it is required for stripe formation in zebrafish, but the fins are almost unaffected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leo and luchs are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores. This suggests that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions, which promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and instruct the patterning of iridophores.

     Fish homozygous for leotK3 or trans-heterozygous for leotK3 over leot1 show an identical phenotype of a completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanophores that hardly cluster together are still present, mostly associated with blue iridophores. This indicates that the dramatic expansion of dense iridophores is an indirect effect, possibly caused by mutant xanthophores covering the iridophores.

     The study suggests that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 interact to form heteromeric gap junctions, which are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the striped pattern in zebrafish and highlight the importance of gap junctions in pigment cell interactions.
summary
     The evolution of insect olfactory receptors has been a topic of interest in understanding the development of the insect sense of smell. Insects use various types of receptors to detect volatile molecules, including olfactory receptors (ORs), ionotropic receptors (IRs), and gustatory receptors (GRs). While IRs are found in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. However, a recent study investigated the olfactory system of three ancient insects, Lepismachilis y-signata (Archaeognatha), Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and Phyllium siccifolium (Phasmatodea), to shed light on the evolution of ORs.

     The study found that ORs and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco) are likely lacking in Lepismachilis, while Thermobia has three Orco candidates and Phyllium has a fully developed OR/Orco-based system. This suggests that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs. The study also suggests that the evolution of the coreceptor Orco occurred after the bristletails split from their last common ancestor with the remaining insects.

     Insect olfactory receptors function as heteromultimers composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and the coreceptor Orco. The study used a combination of approaches to investigate which receptors are involved in odor detection in these insects and in basal insects in general. In neopteran insects, most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family (ORs), which are multitransmembrane domain proteins unrelated to nematode or vertebrate olfactory receptors. The study's findings provide new insights into the evolution of the insect olfactory system and suggest that ORs evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs. This research contributes to our understanding of the development of the insect sense of smell and its evolution over time.
summary
     Biomedical researchers conducted a study in Myanmar to investigate the effectiveness of mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA) in reducing the spread of Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The study took place in four villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border, where MDA was implemented to interrupt malaria transmission. The researchers analyzed data on malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in the villages before and after MDA.

     The results showed that individuals living in neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had a 2.85 times higher risk of experiencing a malaria episode after MDA compared to those living in neighborhoods with high adherence. This suggests a "herd effect," where the protection provided by MDA extends beyond individual participants to the broader community. The study also found that high mosquito biting rates, living with someone who has malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection increased the risk of clinical episodes.

     The researchers observed a decrease in clinical episodes among all groups for a longer period than the prophylactic effect of the administered antimalarials, indicating a group-level effect from MDA adherence. This is the first documentation of a herd effect conferred by MDA for P. falciparum malaria. The increase in clinical P. falciparum episodes post-MDA also corresponded to an increase in village mosquito biting rates.

     The study highlights the importance of adequate population participation in MDA to achieve herd protection. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may hinder elimination efforts. The findings provide an evidence base for further research, intervention, and policy work to support malaria elimination efforts. The study's results suggest that MDA can have a broader impact on reducing malaria transmission than previously thought, making it a valuable tool in the fight against the disease.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how the genetic differences between species contribute to their distinct physical characteristics. One key factor is the expression of proteins in specific tissues, which can be influenced by the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to DNA. However, it has been challenging to determine the importance of TF binding specificity in this process, as previous studies used different methods in different species.

     To address this, researchers analyzed the binding specificities of 242 transcription factors in Drosophila (fruit flies) and compared them to data from humans and mice. The study found that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, with similarities extending to subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. This suggests that TF binding specificities are not subject to significant evolutionary drift.

     The researchers used a technique called HT-SELEX to determine TF binding specificities in Drosophila melanogaster. They found that TFs that belong to the same structural family generally bind to similar sites, and that orthologous TFs have almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding. This level of conservation is striking, with fruit flies having almost as complex a repertoire of TF binding motifs as humans.

     The study also identified TFs with divergent specificities that function in cell types not found in fruit flies. This suggests that the evolution of TF specificities contributes to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells. The researchers conclude that TF binding specificities are highly conserved across 600 million years of bilateria evolution, and that this conservation is not limited to core DNA recognition motifs, but also extends to secondary modes of binding and subtle dinucleotide preferences.

     The study provides new insights into the evolution of TF DNA-binding characteristics and sheds light on the role of divergence and subtle drift in TF DNA binding specificity in animal diversity. The dataset also extends previous models by providing 122 novel high-resolution motifs for Drosophila TF binding specificities. Overall, the study highlights the importance of TF binding specificity in the evolution of species and its contribution to the emergence of novel cell types.
Scientists have developed a new method to study how the heart and lungs develop together in the human body. This process, called cardio-pulmonary co-development, is critical for the proper formation and maturation of these organs. However, there has been a lack of models to investigate this complex interaction during human embryogenesis.

     Researchers used human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which can be directed to become any cell type in the body, to create a model of cardio-pulmonary co-development. They used a stepwise strategy to induce the simultaneous differentiation of cardiac and lung epithelial lineages from hiPSCs. This was achieved by tuning the WNT and nodal signaling pathways in the absence of external growth factors.

     The resulting cells were then cultured in a 3D suspension system, where they formed concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-tissues (μTs). These μTs effectively segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary components, which was partially inhibited by WNT activation. The cardiac component promoted the maturation of alveoli, the air sacs in the lungs, within 3 days.

     When the WNT agonist was withdrawn, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each μT segregated from each other, and cardiac contraction was initiated. This model offers an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.

     The study demonstrates that the simultaneous induction of cardiac and pulmonary lineages from hiPSCs can be achieved using a temporal-specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling. This model can be used to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation. Further investigation is needed to explore the morphological and functional maturation of both cardiac and pulmonary lineages and their crosstalk during this process.
summary
     Biomedical research has long considered the mutation rate of an organism to be a slowly-evolving parameter, strictly regulated to avoid negatively impacting fitness. However, a recent study on Escherichia coli (E. coli) has revealed an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates as a response to changes in selective pressure. The study found that when E. coli cultures adapt to high ethanol stress, hypermutation independently evolves, allowing the cells to rapidly adapt to the stressful environment.

     The research demonstrated that hypermutator states are transitory and repeatedly alternate with decreases in mutation rate. Specifically, population mutation rates rise when cells experience higher stress and decline again once cells are adapted. The study identified cellular mortality as the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates. This finding helps explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy.

     The study used E. coli exposed to high ethanol stress as a model system to investigate the dynamics of hypermutation under near-lethal, complex stress. The researchers found that multiple mutations epistatically interact and diverse evolutionary trajectories can lead to adaptation to high ethanol concentrations. However, in addition to the increase in mutation rate, the study revealed that hypermutator states are transitory and mutation rates decrease again once cells are adapted to the stressful environment.

     The study's findings shed new light on the dynamics of mutation rate evolution and help explain why maintaining high mutation rates is limited in time. The research also identified cellular mortality as a major modulator of the population mutation rate. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how organisms balance robustness and evolvability, and provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the evolution of mutation rates in response to stressful environments.

     Biomedical researchers have identified a key regulator of the low-energy response in plants, known as the transcription factor bZIP63. This protein is activated by the SnRK1 kinase, which is a metabolic master regulator that helps plants adjust to changing environmental conditions. The SnRK1 kinase phosphorylates bZIP63, causing it to change its dimerization preference, which in turn affects the expression of target genes involved in primary metabolism.

     The study found that bZIP63 is a direct target of the SnRK1 kinase and plays a crucial role in the starvation response in Arabidopsis plants. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 is necessary for its function, as a mutant version of bZIP63 that cannot be phosphorylated by SnRK1 was unable to complement the metabolic and senescence phenotypes of a bzip63 knockout mutant.

     The researchers also identified the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10 as the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. They found that bZIP63 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo in a sugar- and energy-dependent manner, and that this phosphorylation is crucial for its dimerization and activity in plants.

     The study proposes a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming. The findings suggest that bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator, especially under stress/starvation conditions, and that its phosphorylation by SnRK1 is essential for its function.

     The researchers used an unbiased approach to identify SnRK1 as one of the kinases responsible for bZIP63 phosphorylation, and found that it targets three highly conserved serine residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63. They also demonstrated that the phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in planta.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the low-energy response in plants and highlights the importance of bZIP63 as a key regulator of metabolic reprogramming in response to changing environmental conditions. The findings have implications for our understanding of plant metabolism and stress responses, and may lead to the development of new strategies for improving crop yields and stress tolerance in plants.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a novel protein called ring finger protein 10 (RNF10) that acts as a messenger between synapses and the nucleus in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in learning and memory. RNF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment, where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). When NMDARs are activated and long-term potentiation (LTP) is induced, RNF10 is translocated from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. This process is mediated by importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus.

     RNF10 plays a crucial role in the maintenance of LTP and structural modifications of dendritic spines, which are essential for learning and memory. Silencing RNF10 prevents the maintenance of LTP and structural modifications of dendritic spines, indicating that RNF10 is necessary for these processes. The researchers found that RNF10 dissociates from the NMDAR complex in an activity-dependent manner and is transported to the nucleus through importin-dependent long-distance transport.

     The study suggests that RNF10 is a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger that encodes activation of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus. RNF10 is highly expressed in the nucleus as well as at synapses, where it directly interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs. Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of LTP lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus, where it can regulate gene expression.

     The researchers propose that RNF10-mediated synaptonuclear signaling is essential for the long-lasting re-shaping of dendritic spines and the induction of LTP. The study highlights the importance of NMDAR complex as a source of protein messengers that can traffic to the nucleus and regulate gene expression in response to synaptic activity. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and learning and memory.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the mechanisms by which Swi2/Snf2 ATPases remodel protein-DNA complexes to regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic states during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. The single-subunit remodeler Mot1, which dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, has emerged as a useful model system for studying Swi2/Snf2 enzymes. To elucidate the structural basis for recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by Mot1, researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2) at 3.8 Å resolution.

     The study reveals that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This structural framework provides insights into how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.

     Swi2/Snf2-type ATPases, including Mot1, remodel protein-DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex. The association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes, which may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism. The study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex, offering a detailed structural framework for the interaction of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex.

     The researchers used biochemical, electron microscopy, and cross-linking studies of the full-length Mot1 complex to complement the crystal structure of the Mot1 N-terminal domain in complex with TBP, NC2, and a TATA promoter DNA fragment. The study provides a structural basis for understanding the recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by Mot1, shedding light on the mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases and their role in regulating chromatin structure and epigenetic states.
Scientists have developed synthetic variants of a natural compound called ternatin, which has been shown to be toxic to cancer cells. Ternatin was previously known to inhibit the growth of fat cells, but its mechanism of action was unknown. The researchers created new versions of ternatin with improved potency, up to 500 times more effective than the original compound. They used a technique called photo-affinity labeling to identify the target of ternatin, which is a complex of a protein called elongation factor-1A (eEF1A), GTP, and aminoacyl-tRNA. This complex is essential for protein synthesis in cells.

The researchers found that mutations in a specific region of the eEF1A protein prevented ternatin from binding and made cells resistant to its toxic effects. They also discovered that two other natural compounds, didemnin and cytotrienin, compete with ternatin for binding to the eEF1A ternary complex. This suggests that the eEF1A ternary complex is a common target for natural products that inhibit protein synthesis.

The study shows that ternatin and its variants inhibit protein synthesis, which correlates with their ability to block cell proliferation. The researchers identified the eEF1A ternary complex as a direct target of ternatin-related cyclic peptides. This is a significant finding, as specific binding of a small molecule to the eEF1A ternary complex has not been reported before.

The discovery of the eEF1A ternary complex as a target for ternatin and its variants has implications for the development of new cancer therapies. The researchers suggest that ternatins may be attractive leads for future medicinal chemistry efforts due to their relative structural simplicity and accessibility by total synthesis. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of action of ternatin and its variants and to explore their potential as cancer treatments.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shed light on the role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating in Lowe syndrome cells. Lowe syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the OCRL gene, which encodes an inositol 5-phosphatase that interacts directly with clathrin. Previous studies have primarily attributed the clinical manifestations of Lowe syndrome to intracellular sorting defects. However, recent studies have revealed that OCRL plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells internalize molecules and proteins from the cell surface.

The research found that the absence of OCRL in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics, resulting in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat, leading to the formation of U-shaped clathrin-coated pits. Additionally, the study discovered that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds to OCRL. This interaction suggests that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor, facilitating the recycling of endocytic factors required for the normal progression of endocytosis.

The study used time-lapse microscopy to analyze clathrin-coated pit dynamics in patient and control cells. The results showed that Lowe syndrome fibroblasts exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from the sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Furthermore, the study found that endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells.

These findings indicate that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to the pathology in patients with OCRL mutations. The study provides new insights into the role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating, highlighting the importance of this process in maintaining normal cellular function. The results suggest that the lack of OCRL impairs the completion of the endocytic reaction, leading to the accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and the formation of actin comets. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Lowe syndrome and may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for this disorder.

     Biomedical researchers have identified a new pathway that contributes to the development of colorectal cancer. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is known to play a significant role in colorectal cancer, but finding effective inhibitors for this pathway has been a challenge. A recent study has shed light on the regulation of this pathway by revealing a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulatory circuit.

     The study found that FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) are elevated in adenomas in mice and human colorectal cancer tissues. These proteins function redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta) at the Y216 site. This phosphorylation event reinforces the pathway output, leading to the accumulation of β-catenin and intestinal tumorigenesis.

     The study also showed that the phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 is a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP (β-transducin repeat-containing protein), which is necessary for Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 using the inhibitor PF-562271 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice, accompanied by reduced levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin. These results indicate that the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.

     Furthermore, the study found that the intestinal level of p-GSK3βY216 was higher in APCmin/+ mice than in control mice, and that PF-562271 treatment suppressed GSK3βY216 phosphorylation and GSK3β ubiquitination. These results strongly support the role of FAK/PYK2 kinase in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis through the phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 to promote Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

     The study's findings suggest that the loss of functional APC induces the expression of FAK and PYK2, which in turn phosphorylate GSK3βY216 to stabilize β-catenin, initiating and supporting intestinal tumorigenesis. The phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 has been known for about two decades, but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. The study's results provide new insights into the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and offer a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of colorectal cancer.
summary
     Biomedical research has investigated the neural control of transitions between posture and movement, focusing on the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. A key aspect of this process is the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another, as suggested by optimal feedback theory. To test this possibility, researchers examined the continuity of vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion, as well as between two standing postures.

The study involved healthy subjects who initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. The results showed that discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination.

These findings indicate that humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies. The vestibular system, which encodes motion of the head in space, plays a vital role in maintaining stability during both quiet standing and locomotion. Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture.

To transition between two motor states, balance correcting responses are disrupted, and the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended. This suspension occurs while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, well before the transition onset. The suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states.

The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies. The vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition. This approach has been used previously to monitor the time course of engagement and disengagement of the vestibular control of balance between self- and externally-driven states of balance control. The results demonstrate that humans "stop balancing" before they start moving and "stop moving" before they start balancing again.
summary
     In cyanobacteria, the circadian output pathway plays a crucial role in regulating metabolic programs in response to light availability. The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Research has shown that deletion of rpaA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. This study investigated the mechanisms underlying this viability defect and found that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night.

     The study demonstrated that both accumulation and utilization of carbon reserves required for energy production during periods of darkness are defective in the rpaA- strain, and that correction of these defects restores viability. The results provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment.

     The research suggests that functional circadian output mediated by the activity of RpaA is required for the anticipatory accumulation of carbon reserves during the day, as well as metabolic switching to carbon catabolism at dusk. These metabolic adaptations allow cells to stimulate energy production and sustain cell viability during periods of darkness that challenge and constrain resources for cyanobacterial growth.

     Exposure to darkness restricts energy availability, creating unique metabolic demands in cyanobacteria that depend on sunlight for energy production through photosynthesis. The rpaA- strain exhibits defects in cell growth and viability in cyclic, but not in constant light environments, suggesting an important role for circadian regulation of gene expression in alternating light/dark cycles.

     The study found that the phosphorylated form of the transcription factor RpaA, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for the coordination of carbon anabolism and catabolism and thus cell viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of rpaA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in cellular energy charge and a severe reduction in fitness.

     The research supports a model in which anticipation of periodic dark-induced resource limitation is one essential role of the cyanobacterial circadian system. The output of the core oscillator, through regulation of RpaA activity, temporally coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for the metabolic demands of periods of darkness. The study highlights the importance of the circadian output pathway in controlling and temporally coordinating essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations.

Biomedical researchers have identified a chromatin signature that accurately distinguishes genes subject to monoallelic expression (MAE) in human cells. MAE is a phenomenon where one allele of a gene is expressed while the other allele remains silent, and it plays a critical role in various human diseases. However, the regulation of MAE has been challenging to study due to its clonal nature.

     The researchers developed an approach to identify MAE genes using chromatin marks associated with active transcription (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me3) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. This chromatin signature was found to be present in approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across various cell types.

     Notably, the MAE signature was enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. The study suggests that MAE is linked to cell differentiation and opens a new approach to studying MAE that is independent of polymorphisms.

     The researchers applied this approach to various cell types and estimated that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE. The detection of the MAE signature does not rely on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or sample clonality, making it feasible to analyze MAE in primary samples, including systematic comparisons of normal and diseased tissue.

     The study also found that genes with the MAE chromatin signature share some pronounced features as a group. Importantly, the MAE identified in clones is reflected by the chromatin signature in a polyclonal sample. The researchers identified novel genes with the MAE chromatin pattern and assessed their allelic bias in monoclonal cell lines.

     The study revealed that a remarkably large fraction of known bivalent genes acquire the MAE chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types, much higher than other genes that are also silent in embryonic stem cells. This suggests that upon activation, these master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature. The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of MAE and its link to cell differentiation.
summary
     Biomedical research has revealed a novel mechanism of activity control for the AAA+ chaperone ClpC, a protein essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance. ClpC forms a protease complex with the peptidase ClpP, and its activity is regulated by the adaptor protein MecA, which targets substrates and stimulates ClpC's ATPase activity. In its ground state, ClpC is repressed by forming large two-helical assemblies through head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains (MDs). These MDs sequester ClpC molecules in an inactive resting state, restricting substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis.

     The coiled-coil MDs play a crucial role in controlling ClpC activity, and their loss leads to constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. This regulatory mechanism is unique compared to other AAA+ chaperones, such as ClpB/Hsp104, which use a repressing belt formed by a long coiled-coil MD to reduce ATPase activity. In contrast, ClpC MDs form intermolecular head-to-head contacts, allowing docking of two layers of ClpC molecules in a helical conformation.

     The formation of this structure involves ATP binding to AAA domains and restricts substrate binding, ClpP, and adaptor protein binding, preventing efficient ATP hydrolysis. Mutating a key regulatory MD residue of ClpE, another bacterial AAA+ chaperone, also causes cellular toxicity, suggesting that the repressing mode of MDs is a general mechanism for controlling bacterial AAA+ chaperone systems. The severe toxicity of ClpC and ClpE MD mutants qualifies these AAA+ chaperones as potential targets for antimicrobial therapies.

     This study provides new insights into the regulation of AAA+ chaperones and highlights the importance of coiled-coil MDs in controlling protein activity. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of bacterial virulence and stress resistance and may lead to the development of novel antimicrobial strategies.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how stem cells remain in a dormant state and how they are reactivated. To address this question, a team of scientists used the fruit fly Drosophila as a model organism to study the behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the stem cells responsible for muscle growth and regeneration in adult flies. The researchers found that AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting that muscles may play a role in AMP reactivation.

     Further investigation revealed that muscles send signals to AMPs through the Insulin pathway, which activates the Notch signaling pathway. Notch, in turn, regulates the activity of dMyc, a protein that promotes cell proliferation. The researchers found that dMyc is essential for AMP reactivation and proliferation, and that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch.

     These findings suggest that muscles serve as a niche for AMPs, providing the necessary signals for their reactivation. The Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs, allowing them to proliferate and contribute to muscle growth and regeneration. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms governing stem cell behavior and has implications for our understanding of muscle development and regeneration in both Drosophila and vertebrates.

     The study also highlights the conserved nature of the Insulin-Notch-dMyc pathway across species, with dMyc acting as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation in Drosophila, similar to its role in vertebrates. The researchers propose a scheme illustrating the muscle niche-induced Insulin/Notch/dMyc cascade governing the reactivation of dormant AMPs, providing a framework for further investigation into the complex interactions between stem cells and their niche.
summary
     Biomedical research has identified the sodium leak channel NALCN as a crucial component in the functioning of substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) neurons. SNr neurons are a type of GABAergic neuron that fire spontaneously at high rates, providing tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas. A depolarizing "leak" current supports this firing pattern, but the molecular basis of this current remained poorly understood until now. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, researchers determined the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons and found that NALCN is the highest expressed nonselective cation channel (NSCC) in these cells.

     The study found that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing, suggesting that NALCN is essential for maintaining tonic activity in these neurons. Furthermore, NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The researchers also discovered that NALCN interacts with other proteins, including Unc80, Unc79, and Fam155a, which are known to interact with NALCN.

     The findings of this study suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN. The basal ganglia circuit plays a critical role in movement control, and dysfunction of this circuit has been implicated in various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease. The identification of NALCN as a key component of SNr neurons provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying basal ganglia function and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for treating movement disorders.

     The study used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of SNr neurons and identified several NSCCs that could potentially generate the tonic depolarizing current. NALCN stood out as a prime candidate for the channel carrying the depolarizing leak current in these cells. The researchers found that SNr neurons require NALCN for appropriate tonic firing, suggesting that NALCN mutations could contribute to basal ganglia-related motor disorders. Disruption of the normal tonic firing of SNr neurons by injection of GABA receptor agonists leads to excessive muscle tension and dystonia, while hyperactivity of the SNr is observed in Parkinsonian animals.
Scientists have developed a new method to cultivate and identify microorganisms that produce antibiotics, which are essential for treating bacterial infections but are becoming increasingly ineffective due to antibiotic resistance. Conventional methods for cultivating microorganisms are limited by their low throughput and sensitivity, making it difficult to access the vast majority of microbial diversity. To address this issue, researchers created a droplet-based microscale cultivation system that allows for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation.

The system consists of tiny droplets, each containing a single microorganism, which are cultivated in a growth substrate designed to mimic environmental conditions. This approach enables the cultivation of previously uncultured species and increases bacterial diversity compared to traditional agar plate cultivation. The system also allows for the detection of antimicrobial compounds produced by the microorganisms, which can be isolated and characterized.

The researchers verified their method by culturing a complex bacterial community from a soil sample and comparing the results to classical agar plate cultivation. They identified and characterized the secreted metabolites of one isolate that showed antimicrobial activity in the droplet screening. The microfluidic droplets provide a genotype-phenotype linkage, meaning that the compounds produced by the microorganisms remain confined to the cell from which they originated.

The combination of bacterial strain discovery during in-droplet cultivation with a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products using bacterial reporter strains in droplets streamlines the process of discovering new antibiotics. The researchers devised an innovative microscale cultivation strategy using a modular droplet-microfluidic platform, which allows for high-density long-term cultivation of millions of single cells in a small volume. This approach increases the practical relevance of the cultivation method by combining it with a screening step to detect and select droplets containing environmental cells producing compounds with antibiotic activity.

Even though axenic cultures of putative new species could not be maintained with standard microbiological cultivation after isolation from droplets, the cells could be used to obtain high-quality genome information. This breakthrough method has the potential to revolutionize the discovery of new antibiotics and provide a solution to the growing problem of antibiotic resistance.
Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a severe form of tuberculosis that affects the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord, resulting in high mortality rates. Despite the use of adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids, which reduce mortality by only 30%, the underlying inflammatory pathophysiology of TBM remains poorly understood. Research has suggested that the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) gene, which regulates inflammatory eicosanoids, may play a critical role in determining the response to corticosteroid treatment.

A study in Vietnam found that patients with the LTA4H TT genotype, which is associated with increased expression of the LTA4H enzyme, had improved survival rates when treated with corticosteroids. In contrast, a study in Indonesia did not find a significant association between the LTA4H TT genotype and survival. Using Bayesian analysis, researchers re-examined both studies and found that the LTA4H TT genotype confers a survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. However, this benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality.

The researchers propose that LTA4H genotyping, combined with disease severity assessment, may help target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it. They suggest that personalized genotype-directed adjunctive glucocorticoid treatment may be warranted, with the drug given only to patients with the LTA4H TT genotype. The study's findings have implications for the treatment of TBM and highlight the need for further research into the role of genetic variants in determining the response to corticosteroid treatment.

One possible explanation for the limited effect of the LTA4H TT genotype in the Indonesia study is that the underlying association is overridden by severe disease, which is a strong independent correlate of mortality. Another possibility is that Indonesia patients presented with a greater degree of dysregulated inflammation, which may not be revealed by standard metrics of disease severity. The researchers suggest that the beneficial effects of dexamethasone for the LTA4H TT genotype may be nullified in more severe disease, which has precedent in other medical conditions. Overall, the study's findings provide new insights into the complex relationship between LTA4H genotype, inflammation, and response to corticosteroid treatment in TBM.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how growth cones navigate axonal projection in response to guidance cues. A recent study has shed light on this process by investigating the role of the protein shootin1 in axon guidance. The study found that knockout mice lacking shootin1 display abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of mice lacking the axon guidance molecule netrin-1.

     Further investigation revealed that shallow gradients of netrin-1 elicit highly polarized phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones. This phosphorylation increases the interaction between shootin1 and the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM, promoting F-actin-adhesion coupling and the generation of forces necessary for growth cone migration. The study demonstrated that the spatially regulated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients.

     The research also showed that shootin1a is expressed at high levels in developing forebrain commissural axons and that its knockout leads to dysgenesis and misprojection of these axons. Moreover, the study found that netrin-1-elicited shootin1a phosphorylation promotes direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM, generating traction force for growth cone motility. Disturbing the spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones inhibited axon turning, but not axon outgrowth, induced by netrin-1 gradients.

     Additionally, the study demonstrated that uncoupling of F-actin-adhesion coupling by shootin1a (1-125) inhibited netrin-1-induced axon outgrowth and turning on laminin. These findings indicate that netrin-1-induced axon guidance, mediated by the shootin1a-L1-CAM interaction, is not limited to growth cones on L1-CAM. Overall, the study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and demonstrates that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the unique humming sound produced by hummingbirds in flight, but the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon have remained unclear. A recent study aimed to shed light on this mystery by investigating the relationship between the aerodynamic forces generated by a hummingbird's flapping wings and the acoustic properties of its hum. The researchers used a combination of advanced measurement techniques, including a 2176-microphone array and a new aerodynamic force platform, to collect data from six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds.

     The study found that the hummingbird's hum is primarily generated by the oscillating lift and drag forces on its wings, which produce higher harmonics that contribute to the characteristic timbre of the sound. The researchers developed an idealized acoustic model that integrated the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics, which accurately predicted the acoustic properties of the hummingbird's hum. This model was corroborated by direct measurements of the 3D aerodynamic forces using the aerodynamic force platform.

     The study also compared the acoustic properties of hummingbirds with those of insects, such as mosquitoes, and found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings originate from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their body weight. The researchers observed that larger birds tend to be quieter, while elongated flies tend to be louder, due to allometric deviations in their wing shapes and sizes.

     The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex bioacoustic behavior of animals in flight. The researchers' use of advanced measurement techniques and modeling approaches has provided new insights into the relationship between aerodynamic forces and acoustic properties, which can inform the development of more accurate models of animal flight and sound production. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering the interplay between aerodynamics and acoustics in understanding the unique sounds produced by animals in flight.
Scientists have long debated the roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in the process of evolution. To address this question, researchers used a combination of ancestral protein reconstruction and a new continuous evolution technology to study the evolution of proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family. This family of proteins plays a crucial role in regulating cell death and survival in animals.

The study found that over long periods of time, contingency, or the unpredictable nature of historical events, played a significant role in shaping the evolution of BCL-2 family proteins. This is in contrast to the idea that necessity, or the physical and chemical properties of the proteins, and chance, or random mutations, were the primary drivers of evolution. The researchers found that even under strong and identical selection pressures, trajectories of evolution launched from different ancestral proteins yielded few common mutations.

The study suggests that the sequences of present-day BCL-2 family proteins are idiosyncratic products of their particular and unpredictable histories. This means that the sequences of these proteins reflect the interaction of accumulated chance events during their descent from common ancestors with the necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and natural selection.

The researchers used a laboratory setting to simulate the evolution of BCL-2 family proteins under selection for new functions. They found that contingency generated by sequence change over phylogenetic timescales played a significant role in shaping the evolution of these proteins. The study also highlights the importance of considering contingency as a primary factor shaping the outcomes of evolution, alongside selection, drift, and mutation.

The results of the study indicate that the paths through sequence space leading to historical protein-protein interaction (PPI) specificities changed repeatedly during the BCL-2 family's history, even when the proteins' PPI binding profiles did not evolve. This suggests that multiple paths to a selected phenotype must be accessible with similar probabilities of being taken for chance to strongly influence the outcomes of adaptive evolution. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of other proteins and the role of contingency in shaping the diversity of life on Earth.
A recent genome-wide analysis of 48 sub-Saharan African groups has provided new insights into the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow within the continent. By examining the combination of genetic markers along chromosomes, researchers were able to identify historical connections between different population groups due to admixture. The study found that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7,000 years, while Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions.

The analysis revealed that most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4,000 years. This movement of alleles into new environments is relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. The study also identified clear evidence for the movement of Eurasian ancestry back into the continent as a result of admixture over various timescales.

Previous studies, such as the African Genome Variation Project, have described the influence of Eurasian and hunter-gatherer ancestry on the population genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa. However, this new analysis provides a more detailed understanding of the extent and timing of key events and their impact on contemporary populations. The study used a haplotype-based approach to measure gene-flow between populations and relate it to potential historical movements of people into and within sub-Saharan Africa.

The results show that admixture is a common feature of human populations across the globe, and genome-wide analyses of African populations are refining previous models of the continent's history and its impact on genetic diversity. The study also highlights the importance of considering the movement of alleles into new environments when studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the complex history of human migration and admixture in sub-Saharan Africa.

Scientists have discovered a new type of genetic control system in bacteria that uses two types of RNA molecules to regulate the production of purine nucleotides. This system, called a tandem riboswitch, consists of two separate RNA molecules that bind to different chemical signals, or ligands, to control the expression of genes involved in purine biosynthesis. The two ligands are phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) and guanine, which are both involved in the production of purine nucleotides.

     The researchers found that when both ligands are present, the tandem riboswitch activates the expression of genes involved in purine biosynthesis. However, when only one of the ligands is present, the riboswitch does not activate gene expression. This behavior is consistent with the function of an IMPLY Boolean logic gate, which is a type of digital logic gate that performs a specific logical operation based on the presence or absence of two inputs.

     The discovery of this tandem riboswitch is significant because it demonstrates that RNA molecules can form complex regulatory systems that can sense multiple chemical signals and control gene expression. This finding supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms, which are thought to have existed billions of years ago, could have managed complex metabolic states without the assistance of protein regulatory factors.

     The researchers used a technique called in-line probing to study the structure and function of the tandem riboswitch. They found that the two aptamers, which are the regions of the RNA molecule that bind to the ligands, interact with each other and with the expression platform, which is the region of the RNA molecule that controls gene expression. The stability of the terminator and antiterminator stems, which are regions of the RNA molecule that regulate gene expression, depends on the relative concentrations of the two ligands.

     The discovery of the tandem guanine-PRPP riboswitch is also significant because it is the first example of two tandem aptamers with different ligand specificities that share the same expression platform. This allows for a new type of logic function to be implemented, which is not possible with single riboswitches. The researchers suggest that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates may be represented by tandem riboswitches that have yet to be discovered in modern cells.

     The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the evolution of genetic control systems and the origins of life on Earth. The discovery of complex RNA regulatory systems in modern cells suggests that these systems may have evolved from simpler systems in ancient RNA World organisms. The researchers propose that RNA aptamers that selectively bound PRPP in ancient times may have persisted to serve as riboswitch aptamers in modern cells.
Summary
     The number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential is a critical determinant of synaptic transmission reliability. However, the source of variability in this fundamental property has been unclear. Researchers have long believed that the number of vesicles released is determined by the probability of vesicle release, which is influenced by the presence of calcium ions. However, a new study using mouse brain slices has found that the number of vesicles released is actually regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP) of vesicles, which is controlled by protein kinase A (PKA) and its target, synapsin.

The study demonstrates that the RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, and that it constrains the number of vesicles released. This means that the number of vesicles released is determined by the size of the RRP, rather than the probability of vesicle release. The researchers found that PKA and synapsin dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released, without altering the probability of release.

The study provides new insights into the mechanisms that control multivesicular release (MVR), a process in which multiple vesicles are released with each action potential. MVR is a widespread phenomenon in the rodent central nervous system and is thought to be the dominant release mode in the human cortex. However, some synapses are limited to the release of a single vesicle per active zone, known as univesicular release (UVR).

The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of synaptic diversity and the development of unifying models of presynaptic function. The results suggest that the size of the RRP is a critical determinant of synaptic function, and that PKA and synapsin play a key role in regulating the number of vesicles released. The study's findings also highlight the importance of considering the RRP as a fundamental synaptic parameter, rather than solely focusing on the probability of vesicle release.
