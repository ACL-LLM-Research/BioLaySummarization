Summary
     Biologists have long known that nervous systems use two main types of communication: chemical and electrical synapses. Chemical synapses involve the release of neurotransmitters, while electrical synapses allow direct communication between cells through gap junctions. However, the complexity of electrical synapses is not as well understood as that of chemical synapses. A recent study investigated the structure of electrical synapses in zebrafish, a type of fish commonly used in scientific research.

The study focused on a specific type of electrical synapse called the Mauthner cell, which is found in the zebrafish nervous system. Using a technique called expansion microscopy, the researchers were able to create a detailed map of the proteins present at the synapse. They found that the synapse is composed of multiple gap junctions, which are clusters of intercellular channels that allow direct communication between cells. These gap junctions were found to be in close association with adherens junctions, which are structures that help cells stick together.

The researchers also found that the majority of the synapse's surface area is occupied by the gap junctions and adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional relationship between these two structures. In contrast, the glutamate receptors, which are responsible for transmitting chemical signals, were found to be confined to small peripheral areas of the synapse. This suggests that most of the synapse functions as an electrical synapse, rather than a chemical one.

The study's findings provide new insights into the structure and organization of electrical synapses, which are found throughout animal connectomes. The researchers suggest that the relationship between gap junctions and adherens junctions may be a key feature of electrical synapses, and that this relationship may be important for understanding the functional diversity of these synapses. The study's results may also have implications for our understanding of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy, which have been linked to abnormalities in electrical synapses.

Overall, the study provides a detailed map of the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses, and highlights the importance of gap junctions and adherens junctions in the functioning of these synapses. The findings may have important implications for our understanding of the nervous system and the development of new treatments for neurological disorders.
Summary
     The pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) is a key region in the brainstem responsible for generating the inspiratory breathing rhythm. Recent research has focused on understanding the role of preBötC neurons that project directly to the facial nucleus (7n) motoneurons, which coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. Using optogenetic viral transgenic approaches, scientists demonstrated that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. However, the effects of photoinhibition were altered by the type of anesthetic employed and between anesthetized and conscious states.

     The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in the regulation of autonomic activity. The study suggests that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is particularly important, as abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases.

     The results of the study raise the question of whether preBötC→7n neurons are part of the preBötC respiratory network or a distinct neuronal group. The working hypothesis is that the facial nucleus projecting preBötC neurons transmit respiratory rhythm, rather than generating it. Selective photoinhibition of preBötC neurons projecting to the facial nucleus (7n) was found to modulate orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity.

     The study utilized a combinatorial viral transgenic approach to selectively transduce and photoinhibit preBötC facial premotor neurons, which affected mystacial pad activity while minimally affecting breathing. The selective approach resulted in a smaller population of transduced neurons with a more restricted anatomical location. The findings suggest that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors.
Summary
     Recent studies have suggested that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) play a crucial role in relaying aversive information to the forebrain and signaling a general alarm. However, most research has focused on their involvement in passive defensive behaviors, such as freezing responses, with limited exploration of their role in active defensive behaviors. To address this, a study examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice.

     The results showed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, suggesting that CGRP activation amplifies the perceived threat and promotes active defensive behaviors. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning.

     The study used a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels to record neuronal activity and found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude. The results confirmed that stimulating CGRP neurons without external aversive stimuli generates rapid, unconditioned freezing behavior in mice. However, under heightened threat conditions, such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds, these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat.

     The study employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals, thereby incorporating an imminent threat. The results showed that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat. The findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behaviors and highlights their importance in modulating threat perception and adaptive responses.
Using diffusion-weighted MRI data from approximately 30,000 UK Biobank participants, researchers investigated the relationship between obesity and human brain structure. They found significant associations between obesity, measured by waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF) and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF). ISOVF is an index of free water, while ICVF is an index of neurite density.

The study identified two coupled but distinct brain systems associated with obesity: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system linked to ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system linked to ICVF. The ISOVF-WHR system was found to co-locate with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. In contrast, the ICVF-WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors.

The researchers estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9×10−4), as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF (P < 0.05). These results suggest a two-way mechanistic model, where genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, while water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.

The study also found that maps of ISOVF-WHR and ICVF-WHR were negatively correlated (r = -0.366, P = 2.3×10−13), indicating that obesity is associated with coupled but anatomically distinct changes in measures of brain water and neurite density. The researchers used prior maps of gene expression, cellular composition, and neurotransmitter receptor density to refine the functional characterization of each obesity-associated system.

Furthermore, the study used genome-wide association statistics (GWAS) to estimate the genetic correlations between each MRI metric and WHR, and found that WHR had a tighter genetic correlation with ICVF than ISOVF. Additionally, the study used prior data on human brain distribution of multiple neurotransmitter receptors to investigate the brain systems where obesity was strongly associated with brain micro-structure measured by ISOVF or ICVF. The results suggest that obesity-related differences in ISOVF and ICVF were coupled but also anatomically, transcriptionally, and neurobiologically differentiated from each other.
Researchers have investigated the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human oral cancer. EMT is a process by which CSCs acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, enabling them to disseminate and metastasize. However, the relevance of EMT CSCs to human cancer has been uncertain, as they have not been observed in human tumour specimens. A previous study identified EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin as markers that can identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. This study aimed to investigate whether these markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours.

The researchers examined over 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours and found a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. Using an artificial neural network (ANN), the researchers were able to predict metastasis with high accuracy (87-89%). The study observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, which were highly predictive of metastatic disease.

The researchers used immunofluorescent staining to identify EMT CSCs that retained the epithelial marker EpCAM alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and the CSC plasticity marker CD24. They found that single EMT CSCs were disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours, but epithelial keratins were not retained. The retention of EpCAM alone was not sufficient to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlated with metastasis.

The study's strength lies in its ability to examine the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours. This enabled the researchers to identify single disseminating EMT CSCs and use them to train an ANN to predict metastasis. The combination of EpCAM, Vimentin, and CD24 markers accurately distinguished EMT CSCs from epithelial tumour cells and identified tumour cells that had undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region.

The findings of this study provide evidence that EMT CSCs are present in human oral cancer specimens and are highly predictive of metastatic disease. The ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy using an image-based machine learning approach has significant implications for the diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer.
Summary
     Biomedical research has long recognized the importance of apoptosis (programmed cell death) and efferocytosis (clearance of apoptotic cells) in tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which these processes regulate repair are not fully understood. A recent study used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. The results showed that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident macrophages, during inflammation.

The study found that human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. In mouse wounds, the researchers detected upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in mice revealed that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreased efferocytosis and abrogated wound repair.

The study provides an atlas of the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. The results show that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways are upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. The study also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds.

The study highlights the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. The findings suggest that efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair, and that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of tissue repair and identifies potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
biomedical researchers have developed a novel genetic barcoding approach called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing (TaG-EM) that enables the in vivo tagging of defined cell populations in Drosophila. This method involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, allowing the barcode sequence to be read out during single-cell sequencing. By creating multiple independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables the positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, the identification of multiplet droplets, and the barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. The genetic barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded fly lines using next-generation sequencing, facilitating population-scale behavioral measurements.

The TaG-EM approach takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila, providing a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing. This method has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. The genetic barcodes can be used to multiplex behavioral or other phenotypic measurements, making TaG-EM a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms.

While TaG-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell gene expression data, it is likely that the strength of the Gal4 driver contributes to the labeling density. However, variable recovery of TaG-EM barcodes driven by the same pan-midgut Gal4 driver has also been observed. Despite this limitation, TaG-EM has the potential to revolutionize the field of biomedical research by enabling novel capabilities in several different experimental contexts, including cell atlas projects, multiplet droplet identification, and population-scale behavioral measurements. The development of TaG-EM represents a significant advancement in the field of single-cell sequencing and spatial genomics, enabling new types of detailed analyses to study important biological processes such as development and nervous system function.

     Biologists have long sought to understand how certain animals, such as poison frogs, have evolved complex defense mechanisms to protect themselves from predators. One group of frogs, the Dendrobatidae family, has developed the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense. However, previous research has focused primarily on colorful, defended species, leaving the origins of this ability in inconspicuous, undefended species unclear. A new study provides evidence that species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable, albeit low, amounts of alkaloids. The researchers found that these frogs regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. This suggests that diet alone is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype.

     The study proposes a new concept, "passive accumulation," which differs from sequestration in that it involves no specialized transport and storage mechanisms, yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. Passive accumulation is thought to be an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae and possibly in related taxa. The researchers propose that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense.

     The study incorporates ideas from pharmacokinetics with data from poison frogs to develop an evolutionary model that could explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals. The model suggests that many animals, including poison frogs, have been exposed to toxins through their diet for a long time. However, few experiments have been conducted to quantify the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs.

     The study provides a new alkaloid dataset for dendrobatid frogs and their relatives, but it is limited in scope. The researchers propose that most, if not all, dendrobatids and their most recent common ancestors have long been exposed to toxins through their diet. The study highlights the need for further research on the relationship between toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs. The findings have implications for understanding the evolution of chemical defenses in animals and the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a significant role in chemotherapy resistance and is a major challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. EMT is a complex process involving multiple signaling pathways and its reversal, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), which has hindered the development of effective treatments. Researchers used a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. The study found that ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) is elevated during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes.

RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis, mediated by ERK and mTOR signaling, are essential for EMT/MET completion. Inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Importantly, combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. The study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

The researchers employed an EMT-lineage-tracing model to discover that the RiBi pathway is transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT/MET. The enhanced activation of the RiBi pathway diminishes as tumor cells accomplish phenotype changes. In general, a lower RiBi activity was observed in mesenchymal tumor cells than in epithelial ones. Consistent with the Tri-PyMT model, a compound called BMH21 synergized with chemotherapy, leading to a significantly lower metastatic tumor burden than the mock or mono-treatment groups.

The study also analyzed scRNA-seq data of primary tumor cells from two breast cancer patients to investigate the potential association of RiBi activity with EMT status of tumor cells. The results suggested that the upregulated RiBi pathway is equally needed for mesenchymal tumor cells to undergo MET during their outgrowth in the lungs. Ribosome biogenesis was recognized as a crucial factor in cancer pathogenesis a century ago. The involvement of unwonted RiBi activities during both EMT and MET processes makes RiBi a new and better target for overcoming EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis. Targeting the RiBi pathway by RNase Pol I inhibitor impaired the EMT/MET transitioning capability of tumor cells and significantly synergized with common chemotherapeutics.

Summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how the brain processes and encodes language in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts. A recent study investigated the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts during movie watching to determine the extent to which brain responses change depending on visual context. The study found that across different contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, when multimodal context is considered, these differences are reduced, and the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing.

The study suggests that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organization is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information. The brain is adept at integrating information across sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations, a process critical for navigating the multimodal nature of real-world experiences. The study's findings highlight the role of visual context in modulating the neural representation of abstract and concrete words, and similar effects may be observed in contexts that engage other sensory modalities.

The study's results indicate that brain activation underlying concrete and abstract conceptual processing fundamentally changes as a function of visual context. When abstract concepts are situated in highly related contexts, they engage neurobiological regions that are usually involved in processing concrete concepts and are related to processing of external visual information. Conversely, when concrete concepts are displaced from the visual context, they engage more abstract-like regions in the brain that are related to processing of internal/interoceptive/affective information.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and encodes language in complex and dynamic naturalistic contexts. The results suggest that the neural representation of concepts is not fixed but rather dynamic and context-dependent, and that the brain is highly adaptable in its ability to integrate information across sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations. Further research is needed to fully understand the extent to which these findings generalize to other contexts and sensory modalities.
Summary
     Cancer immunotherapy has shown promise in treating cancer, but its application is limited by the lack of targetable antigens on tumor cells. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a cellular pathway that conceals neoantigens by destroying RNA products from genes with truncating mutations. Researchers developed a high-throughput screen to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells and found that disrupting the kinase SMG1's phosphorylation of UPF1 is a potential disruptor of NMD. This led to the design of a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, which elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. KVS0001 also increases the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. This provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which it plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

The researchers conducted a high-throughput screen using ratiometric analysis of transcripts to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. The screen implicated disruption of SMG1's phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. KVS0001, a novel SMG1 inhibitor, was designed and shown to elevate the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. KVS0001 also increased the presentation of immune-targetable HLA class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells.

Inhibition of NMD with KVS0001 led to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting near total blockade of the NMD pathway. Western blotting showed that KVS0001 substantially decreases the amount of phosphorylated UPF1, the downstream target of SMG1 kinase activity, in three different cell lines. The researchers also investigated whether KVS0001 could alter the cell surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncating mutations in NCI-H358 and LS180 cancer cell lines. Treatment with KVS0001 resulted in specific increases in the transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, just as did a previously reported SMG1-specific small molecule inhibitor, SMG1i-11. KVS0001 was shown to be a specific inhibitor of SMG1 that was soluble and could easily be administered to mice. The researchers conclude that KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which it plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.
Keep in mind that age is the most significant risk factor for cancer, but aging rates vary across individuals. A new measure of aging, called Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge), was used to predict the risk of site-specific and overall cancer in a study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biobank. Phenotypic Age Acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) was calculated by subtracting the effect of chronological age from PhenoAge, and an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) was generated based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRSs).

The study found that participants who were biologically older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer compared to those who were biologically younger, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.22 (95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared to those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge.

PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors, indicating that adherence to a healthy lifestyle can retard the aging process. Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer, even after adjusting for chronological age. The study suggests that PhenoAgeAccel can be a cost-effective indicator for measuring biological age and a novel biomarker for cancer risk prediction.

The study also found that participants with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge had the greatest incident cancer risk, with standardized 5-year incident cancer rates of 6.90% and 5.17% for biologically older men and women, respectively, compared to 5.78% and 4.58% for biologically younger men and women. The results of this study provide further evidence of the association between biological age and cancer risk, and highlight the potential of PhenoAgeAccel as a tool for cancer risk assessment.

     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the causes of congenital pulmonary cysts, a condition characterized by abnormal lung development. While previous studies have implicated disrupted airway epithelial cell growth in the formation of cystic lesions, the role of lung mesenchymal cells in this process has remained poorly understood. In a recent study, scientists used genetic mouse models to investigate the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development.

     The study found that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were observed in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. Additionally, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs.

     Notably, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

     The study provides solid in vivo evidence that Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchymal cells is indispensable in lung development. Lung mesenchymal deletion of Bmpr1a at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs.

     The study demonstrates that mesenchymal Bmpr1a is essential for lung development, particularly airway branching morphogenesis. Although Bmpr1a is expressed predominantly in fetal mouse lung airway epithelial cells at the early gestation stage, its expression in fetal lung mesenchyme is also evident during mid-gestation. The inverse relationship between Bmpr1a deletion (intracellular BMP signaling) and Bmp4 ligand expression in these fetal lung mesenchymal progenitor cells was further confirmed by comparing Bmp4 expression in isolated fetal lung mesenchymal cells with different Bmpr1a genotypes. Alterations of other key pathways, including Fgf, Wnt, and Shh, were not detected by RNA-seq and RT-PCR through analyzing the related targeted genes. The pathological phenotype resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases.
Scientists have investigated the role of anionic lipid molecules, specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), in regulating the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in living cells. EGFR is a protein that plays a crucial role in cell growth and division, and its activity is influenced by the surrounding lipid environment in the cell membrane.

Using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy, researchers were able to visualize both EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. They found that EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains aggregate together before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), a protein that activates EGFR. After EGF stimulation, the degree of coaggregation between EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 decreases, and this decrease depends on the activity of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), an enzyme that hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2.

The researchers also found that reducing the amount of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane decreases the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after EGF stimulation. Additionally, inhibiting the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 after EGF stimulation decreases the phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654, a key step in EGFR activation.

These findings suggest that EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR molecules are mutually regulated. The local PI(4,5)P2 environment around EGFR stabilizes EGFR dimers, increasing EGFR autophosphorylation upon EGF stimulation. The subsequent hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by PLCγ plays a crucial role in deactivating EGFR.

The researchers propose that autogenous remodeling of the lipid environment regulates EGFR activity. They suggest that the preferential coaggregation of EGFR nanodomains with PI(4,5)P2 rather than phosphatidylserine (PS) is due to the curvature of the membrane, which affects the interactions between RAS proteins and lipids. These findings provide new insights into the regulation of EGFR activity and the role of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane.
Summary
     Stramenopiles are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that include multicellular algae, plant and fish pathogens, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. Unlike most eukaryotes, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis pathway, where the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. In Blastocystis, a mitochondrial carrier protein has been identified that transports glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis.

     Comparative analyses with the human mitochondrial oxoglutarate carrier and dicarboxylate carrier show that the glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, including complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules.

     The glycolytic intermediate carrier identified in Blastocystis represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. The carrier has a unique substrate specificity and plays a central role in carbon and energy metabolism. The discovery of this carrier provides new insights into the metabolic pathways of stramenopiles and highlights the potential for developing targeted therapies against these pathogens. The glycolytic intermediate carrier is a ubiquitous protein in stramenopiles, but is absent in other eukaryotes, making it a promising target for the development of new treatments for diseases caused by stramenopile pathogens.
Researchers have developed a new framework for human genetic association studies, known as the Haplotype Function Score (HFS) framework. This framework uses a deep learning model to calculate a functional genomic activity score for each haplotype in an individual, replacing the traditional genotype in association studies. The HFS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank and identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, which is a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis.

The HFS framework offers several advantages over classic SNP-based methods, including improved biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits. Enrichment analysis using the HFS framework uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability. For example, the framework identified associations between the circadian pathway and chronotype, as well as between the arachidonic acid pathway and intelligence.

The researchers also integrated the HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which showed an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. This suggests that the HFS framework has the potential to improve the accuracy of genetic association studies.

Compared to other functionally aware fine-mapping methods, such as PolyFun and SbayesRC, the HFS framework detected more causal signals for each trait, with a median increase of 63 signals. The HFS framework was applied to 14 polygenic traits in the UKB British ancestry training set, identifying 16,597 significant HFS-trait associations at a threshold of p < 5 × 10−8.

Overall, the HFS framework offers a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits and has the potential to improve the accuracy of genetic association studies. However, further progress in algorithm and computation, as well as data resources, is still needed to fully realize the potential of this framework.
The current study investigated the impact of three different types of 3-month mental training modules on the hippocampus, a brain region critical for regulating stress, structure, function, and behavior. The training modules focused on either attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, or socio-cognitive skills. A total of 332 healthy adults participated in the study, which used a combination of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity.

The results showed that only the socio-affective training module, which cultivated compassion and care, was associated with an increase in hippocampal CA1-3 subfield volume, along with corresponding alterations in functional connectivity and a reduction in total diurnal cortisol output. In contrast, the attention-based and socio-cognitive training modules did not produce significant changes in hippocampal subfield volume or functional connectivity.

The study also found that the observed increases in CA1-3 volumes following socio-affective mental training were small-sized effects, but were consistent when independently assessing the left and right hippocampus subfields. Furthermore, the training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Notably, a multivariate approach revealed that other subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels.

The study provides a link between a socio-emotional behavioral intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults. The findings suggest that socio-affective training may be a promising approach for promoting hippocampal plasticity and reducing stress-related cortisol output. The study's results have implications for the development of interventions aimed at mitigating the negative effects of stress on the brain and behavior. Future studies may directly test the potential specificity of the interrelationship between stress on the hippocampus using further targeted measurements.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how species adapt to their local environments, a process known as local adaptation. A key factor in this process is the presence of genetic variations, or alleles, that have a significant impact on an organism's fitness. These alleles are often found in regions of the genome where recombination, the shuffling of genetic material, is suppressed, such as in inversions. Inversions are large segments of DNA that are reversed end-to-end, which can lead to the accumulation of locally adapted alleles. However, it is unclear how much of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect.

     To address this question, researchers conducted genome-wide association studies on three species of sunflowers: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris. These species have large numbers of species-specific inversions, which are regions of the genome where recombination is suppressed. The study found evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This suggests that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion.

     The study also estimated the number of regions genome-wide that could potentially contribute to local adaptation for each variable and phenotype, which is related to the genotypic redundancy. The results show that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci. This suggests that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability, while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions. The observed repeatability associated with inversions further supports the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions, rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive.

     Biomedical research has shown that aging effects on single cells are heterogeneous, whereas at the organ and tissue levels, aging phenotypes tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium, a bilayer of luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, exhibits substantial stereotypical changes with age, particularly in luminal epithelial cells, which are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. This study aimed to investigate the effects of aging on the transcriptomes of primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger and older women.

     The researchers generated and analyzed transcriptomes from these cells and found age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, as well as increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. The study revealed that age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. The expression of gap junction protein GJB6 in epithelial cells increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells.

     The study also found that age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. The researchers speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.

     The study demonstrates how directional and variant responses that contribute to aging biology are integrated in breast tissue of older women, and how these changes could lead to increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. The findings suggest that increased variances in the transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals are a significant outcome of the aging process and are likely central to understanding the increased susceptibility to breast cancers with age. The study highlights the importance of lineage-specific analyses in unraveling the mechanisms underlying tissue-level molecular changes during normal aging.
Scientists have been trying to understand why some plants are more resistant to pests and diseases than others. To do this, they often need to conduct large and time-consuming experiments. A new study explored an alternative approach using data from plant DNA sequencing. The researchers looked at 207 natural lines of a plant called field pennycress, which was grown in a controlled environment and infested with aphids, mildew, and other microorganisms. They found that the amount of DNA from these pests varied between the different plant lines, and this variation was heritable, meaning it was influenced by the plant's genetic makeup. The study also showed that the amount of pest DNA was associated with the plant's climate of origin and its natural chemical defenses.

The researchers used a technique called genome-wide association analysis to identify specific genetic variants that were linked to the variation in pest DNA. They found that some of these variants were located in genes that are known to be involved in plant defense, while others were in previously unknown regions of the genome. Additionally, the study identified epigenetic changes, such as differences in DNA methylation, that were associated with the amount of pest DNA. These epigenetic changes were found in regions of the genome that are involved in regulating gene expression.

The study provides new insights into the defense mechanisms of field pennycress, a plant that is being considered as a model species for studying plant biology. It also shows that data from plant DNA sequencing, which is often discarded, can be used to estimate the intensity of plant-pollinator interactions. This approach has the potential to be widely applied in both basic and applied research, particularly with the increasing availability of large sequencing datasets. The findings of this study can contribute to the development of more pest-resistant crop varieties, which is essential for improving crop yields and reducing the use of pesticides.

     Biomedical researchers investigated the potential of using drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity to suppress the emergence of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria. Collateral sensitivity occurs when resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to a partner drug. The study focused on compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ) enzyme, which is essential for the parasite's survival. The researchers profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors, including TCMDC-125334 and DSM265, a clinical candidate. TCMDC-125334 was found to be active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with DSM265. The most common mechanism of resistance to TCMDC-125334 was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, although one mutation, DHODH I263S, conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. Selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus, resulting in double mutant parasites that exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. The researchers also tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation that were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro. The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme. The study suggests that combining two DHODH inhibitors based on their collateral sensitivity profiles may not be sufficient to prevent the emergence of resistance in P. falciparum in vitro.
biomedical summary
     The establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance vary significantly across different biogeographic regions. While most malaria infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions. Current models of resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance, possibly due to overlooking the feedback between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this, a novel compartmental model was developed to track sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. The results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. This trend is supported by validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data. Post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. The study highlights the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution. Strain diversity and associated strain-specific host immunity, dynamically tracked through the macroparasitic structure, can predict the complex relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance frequencies. The model implies that control protocols should vary from region to region and that there is no one-size-fits-all cure for malaria control worldwide. The inclusion of strain diversity in the model provides a new mechanistic explanation as to why Southeast Asia has persisting resistance to certain antimalarial drugs, including chloroquine, despite a lower transmission intensity than Africa. In regions with low strain diversity, parasites cannot repeatedly reinfect hosts, and clinically immune hosts do not carry infections very often. The study presents a theoretical argument, built on the basis of a mechanistic model, as to why different biogeographic regions show variation in the invasion and maintenance of antimalarial drug resistance. The results suggest that strain diversity plays a crucial role in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution, and that control protocols should be tailored to specific regions to effectively combat malaria.
Summary
     Researchers investigated the impact of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), the most abundant phytocannabinoid in cannabis, on early embryonic development. Using a stepwise in vitro differentiation system, they found that Δ9-THC increased the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not of their primed counterparts. This effect was dependent on the CB1 receptor binding and was associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC increased the glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities of ESCs, a metabolic rewiring that was retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells (PGCLCs) in the absence of direct exposure. This metabolic rewiring was associated with an alteration of the transcriptional profile of PGCLCs.

The study tested three distinct developmental windows: exposure of ESCs, exposure of EpiLCs, and combined ESCs + EpiLCs exposure. Cells were exposed to Δ9-THC in a wide dose range of 0.1 nM-100µM, corresponding to physiologically-relevant concentrations of Δ9-THC in cannabis users. The results showed a moderate but significant impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early embryonic processes. The study also highlighted the importance of the metabolic remodelling induced by Δ9-THC and its potential role as a driver of exposure memory through differentiation stages.

The researchers used a well-characterized in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation events culminating in the differentiation of PGCLCs. This study is the first to shed light on the impact of Δ9-THC at these stages, which unfold during the first trimester in humans. The results provide new insights into the molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development.

Scientists have discovered a new type of seed, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov., from the Famennian period of the Late Devonian, approximately 372-359 million years ago. This seed is significant because it has three integumentary wings that extend outwards and fold inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing most of the nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule, which is a protective and pollinating structure found in most Famennian ovules.

The discovery of Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. This finding indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms, such as seed plumes and pappus, which appeared later in the Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic periods, respectively.

Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds, like Alasemenia, are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions. This suggests that three-winged seeds have an advantage in anemochory, or wind dispersal.

Alasemenia is the second acupulate ovule discovered in the Famennian period, following Guazia and Warsteinia. These findings suggest that the evolutionarily novel wings, as integument outgrowths and the most important mechanism for seed dispersal by wind, appeared early in the spermatophytes and had been manifested in younger lineages.

The discovery of Alasemenia also indicates the diversity of Famennian winged ovules and the evolutionary sequence of ovule wings. Compared to Famennian four-winged ovules of Warsteinia and Guazia, Alasemenia with three distally outwards extending wings shows an advantage in anemochory. The presence of Alasemenia in the Jianchuan mine of China, where Xinhang fossil forest was discovered to comprise in situ lycopsid trees of Guangdedendron, provides further evidence of the early evolution of winged seeds.

Overall, the discovery of Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov. provides new insights into the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms and the diversity of winged ovules in the Famennian period.
Summary
     Researchers have identified a new mechanism contributing to the progression of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, a type of blood cancer. The study found that the protein RAPSYN is highly expressed in patients with Ph+ leukemia and plays a crucial role in stabilizing the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is a hallmark of the disease. RAPSYN achieves this by mediating the neddylation of BCR-ABL, a process that competes with the protein's ubiquitination-dependent degradation. As a result, the stability of BCR-ABL is increased, promoting leukemogenesis.

The study also discovered that SRC phosphorylates RAPSYN, activating its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity and further promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. In contrast, depletion of RAPSYN expression or inhibition of its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability and inhibited tumor formation and growth. This suggests that targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation could be a potential therapeutic approach for treating Ph+ leukemia.

The researchers found that RAPSYN is highly expressed in patients with Ph+ leukemia and its expression levels correlate with those of BCR-ABL, indicating the specificity of RAPSYN-mediated neddylation of BCR-ABL. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that RAPSYN inhibition significantly suppressed the survival of Ph+ leukemia cells, and its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity is essential for mediating BCR-ABL neddylation.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the pathogenesis of Ph+ leukemia and identify RAPSYN as a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of the disease. The study also highlights the importance of protein homeostasis in maintaining normal cellular function and suggests that targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation could be a promising strategy for treating Ph+ leukemia. The results of this study have implications for future investigations into the role of RAPSYN in other cancer types and its potential as a therapeutic target.
Scientists have been searching for new alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to the growing threat of antibiotic resistance. One promising approach is the use of phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, which directly degrade peptidoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls. However, the discovery of these enzymes is often hindered by the limited availability of phage genomes. To address this issue, researchers have developed a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptides as a template.

In this study, the researchers used the antimicrobial peptide P307, derived from the lysin PlyF307, as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases in the proteome of Acinetobacter baumannii, a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics. The researchers identified five potential peptidoglycan hydrolases, designated PHAb7-PHAb11, and tested their bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens. Two of these enzymes, PHAb10 and PHAb11, showed potent bactericidal activity even after being heated to 100°C for 1 hour, while the other three were sensitive to heat.

The researchers also solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11, which revealed that PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, making it hyper-thermostable. In contrast, PHAb8 formed a monomer and was thermosensitive. The safety and efficacy of PHAb10 were further demonstrated in two mouse models of bacterial infection.

This study demonstrates the feasibility of using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptides as a template to mine new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties from bacterial proteomes. The discovery of PHAb10 and PHAb11 provides new clues for the development of promising antimicrobial drugs. This approach has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics and address the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.

Researchers investigated the development of sleep patterns in children and adolescents, focusing on the synchronization of fast sleep spindles (12.5-16 Hz) with slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. They analyzed data from four age groups: 5-6, 8-11, 14-18 years, and 20-26 years. The study aimed to understand how the coalescence between slow oscillations and sleep spindles develops from childhood to young adulthood.

The results showed that the predominant type of fast spindles in children was development-specific, occurring in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range. However, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident in all four age groups, but was less precise in children. The study found that fast spindle maturity, which indicates the similarity between development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups.

Further analysis revealed that the maturation of dominant, development-specific fast sleep spindles towards adult-like fast spindles may explain age-related differences in the strength and temporal precision of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns. The study also found that fast centro-parietal spindles become more numerous and adult-like in their frequency and amplitude characteristics in the course of maturation. Additionally, the individual neural rhythms that define the coupling undergo substantial changes during child and adolescent development, with sleep spindles increasing in occurrence and average frequency.

To capture the "maturational stage" of fast spindles for each participant, the researchers computed the distance between development-specific and adult-like fast sleep spindles within each individual at a given age. The results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles acts as a trigger for precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. Overall, the study provides new insights into the development of sleep patterns in children and adolescents, highlighting the importance of fast spindle maturity in the maturation of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns.
Summary
     Biomedical research articles often feature genes that have been studied extensively prior to the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, despite the availability of high-throughput technologies that can identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. An analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. This abandonment is not due to a lack of underlying biological experimental evidence, but rather a bias in the selection of genes as research targets. In fact, publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations.

     A literature review identified 45 biological and experimental factors that have been proposed to affect the choice of genes studied, and 33 of these factors were found to be significantly associated with the selection of hit genes in -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, a tool called Find My Understudied Genes (FMUG) was developed. FMUG allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits and has been demonstrated to be useful in identifying genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging.

     The findings suggest that understudied genes are abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. This abandonment may be driven by the concern that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact. To address this issue, FMUG was created to help scientists identify and investigate understudied genes. The tool is available for download as a MacOS/Windows app and can be accessed at fmug.amaral.northwestern.edu. By using FMUG, researchers can promote the investigation of understudied genes and potentially uncover new insights into biological processes and disease.
Researchers have investigated the potential health effects of artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides, which are often marketed as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened drinks. However, the impact of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, a zebrafish model was developed to study the effects of high glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development.

The zebrafish model exhibited excessive angiogenesis, a condition characterized by the formation of new blood vessels, which is similar to the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). The study found that both glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides induced excessive formation of blood vessels, particularly intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Further analysis revealed that the excessively branched vessels were formed by the ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells.

Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis of ECs in embryos exposed to high glucose showed an increased ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated proangiogenic genes. The study also identified the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway as a key regulator of excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides. Specifically, reduced foxo1a expression was found to mediate the excessive angiogenesis by upregulating the expression of marcksl1a.

The results of this study provide new evidence of the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms. The findings suggest that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides can lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent ECs into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway. The study's results have implications for our understanding of the roles of noncaloric monosaccharides in human health and highlight the need for further research in this area. The findings also suggest that the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for preventing or treating vascular dysfunctions associated with excessive angiogenesis.
Biomedical researchers investigated how the human brain stores and retrieves multiple sequences of information, such as remembering a series of items with different colors and spatial locations. Participants were asked to memorize a sequence of items and then reproduce the full sequence of colors and locations one after another. The researchers manipulated the consistency between the location and color sequence trajectories to see how it affected memory performance.

     The results showed that when the location and color sequences had consistent trajectories, participants performed better in memory tasks and demonstrated a correlation between the reproduced color and location sequences. Furthermore, neural activity in the brain showed reactivation of common trajectories during both encoding and retention periods, and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling location sequences. This suggests that the brain uses a shared common structure to store multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, facilitating efficient information organization in working memory (WM).

     EEG recordings provided neural evidence for the use of a "compressive" strategy, where shared trajectories are reactivated during encoding and retention, and spontaneous replay of color sequences occurs during location recall. The reactivation of shared structures was related to WM behavior and neural replay. Additionally, when participants prepared to recall location sequences, the currently task-irrelevant color sequence demonstrated a spontaneous sequential replay profile, highlighting the close bond between color and location sequences when they share a common trajectory.

     The findings suggest that the brain spontaneously leverages common structures to facilitate WM, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of multiple sequences. Behaviorally, sequences with consistent color-location trajectories showed enhanced memory precision and a significant correlation between reproduced color and location sequence trajectories. These results provide converging evidence for the use of replay-based neural mechanisms in WM to mediate sequence combinations based on common structures.

     The study's findings are consistent with previous research on neural replay, which has been posited to represent abstract structure, structure-based inference, and generalization. When participants prepared to recall location sequences, neural replay occurred for color sequences but not for location sequences, supporting the spontaneous nature of neural replay, as color features were not task-relevant at that time. Overall, the study demonstrates the brain's ability to efficiently store and retrieve multiple sequences by leveraging shared common structures through compressed encoding and neural replay.
summary
     Mutations in the human PURA gene cause a neurodevelopmental disorder known as PURA syndrome. This condition is characterized by full disease penetrance, meaning that nearly all reported mutations in the gene result in the development of the disorder. Researchers investigated the effects of these mutations on the structure and function of the PURA protein, which is a nucleic acid-binding protein.

     The study found that mutations in the PURA gene impair the protein's ability to co-localize with processing bodies, which are cellular structures involved in the regulation of gene expression. The mutations either disrupted the protein's folding integrity, its ability to bind to nucleic acids, or its ability to form dimers. To better understand the effects of these mutations, the researchers solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of the PURA protein and used molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements to study its structure and dynamics.

     The results showed that the PURA protein has unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity, making it particularly susceptible to mutations that impair its structural integrity. This finding provides an explanation for why even conservative mutations in the PURA gene result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome. The researchers also found that the structural flexibility and folding promiscuity of the PURA protein were supported by the crystal structure of a variant of the protein with a mutation that exposed a solvent-exposed side chain.

     The study's findings were further supported by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicated high intrinsic motions of the N-terminal domain of the PURA protein. In contrast to other genetic disorders, such as Rett syndrome, the pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence, rather than in specific hot-spot regions. The study provides the first experimental assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on the folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding of the protein, as well as its subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. The results of this study contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PURA syndrome and may have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder.
Summary
     Biomedical research has identified a potential interaction between two proteins, TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (ANO1), which plays a crucial role in the water efflux of exocrine glands, including sweat glands. This interaction may be involved in perspiration, the process by which the body cools itself through the evaporation of sweat. In a study using mouse foot pads, researchers found that TRPV4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in secretory cells of sweat glands. The study also showed that TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were inhibited by menthol, a compound known to activate a related protein, TRPM8.

The researchers found that acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in mouse foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type mice but not in TRPV4-deficient mice. Additionally, menthol inhibited sweating in both wild-type and TRPM8 knockout mice. The study also showed that basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. These findings suggest that TRPV4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration through its interaction with ANO1.

Furthermore, the study found that TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. This suggests that TRPV4 may play a role in regulating perspiration in humans.

The researchers propose that TRPV4 and ANO1 form a complex that promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads. They also suggest that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells are involved in the secretion of macromolecular components, as well as water and ions. The study's findings have implications for the development of agents that regulate perspiration, which may be useful in treating conditions such as excessive sweating or anhidrosis. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying perspiration and highlights the potential therapeutic applications of targeting TRPV4 and ANO1.
Scientists have developed a new way to describe the shape and size of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for processing sensory information and controlling movement. Using data from 11 primate species and over 70 other mammalian species, researchers found that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As these folds merge, the cortices of different species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, indicating that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5.

This new understanding allows for a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale, enabling the detection of subtle changes in brain shape that may not be apparent at a single scale. The researchers demonstrated the importance of this new understanding by showing a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology, with a more than fourfold increase in effect size at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses.

The new method of describing cortical morphology as a function of scale is more detailed and informative than previous methods, which only listed summary morphometric measures or every sulcus and gyrus. This new syntax provides a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and a common set of mechanisms governing cortical folding. The researchers also showed that their novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes much better than previous methods, with a fourfold increase in effect size.

The study's findings suggest that representative primate and mammalian brains share a range of key shape properties, in addition to agreeing in fractal dimension. The researchers demonstrated a universal self-similar scaling for primate and mammalian cortices, with a fractal dimension of almost exactly 2.5 in all cases. This fractal scaling has been postulated in previous studies, but the current research provides empirical evidence for its universality.

The new understanding of cortical morphology has the potential to generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions, and may lead to a more accurate diagnosis and treatment of brain-related disorders. The researchers propose this new syntax as the basis for a more rigorous characterization of brain morphology and morphological changes, enabling a better understanding of the complex relationships between brain shape and function.
summary
     The study investigated the dynamics of the RELA transcription factor in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells. RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in PDAC tumours. Using live single-cell imaging, the researchers observed that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA in PDAC cells. Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets revealed that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics.

     RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. The study also characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα.

     The researchers used RNA-seq to identify genes with distinct patterns of expression based on dependence on TNFα dose and RELA activation. Live imaging with knockdown of selected targets uncovered novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics in PDAC, including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB.

     The study found that the known actin modulators ARHGAP31/NUAK2 are both RELA targets and regulators of nuclear RELA with TNFα, providing a potential mechanism mediating the relationship between actin and RELA. In contrast, NFKB1 and NFKB2 showed increased interaction with RELA with TNFα, suggesting that RELA forms NF-κB heterodimers with REL, NFKB1, and NFKB2 in PDAC cells.

     The results suggest that IκBβ plays a significant role in suppressing TNFα induction of nuclear RELA in PDAC cells. Nuclear RELA AUC in control conditions was affected by all of the tested NF-κB pathway components in PANC1 cells, indicating that RELA is highly modulated by NF-κB/IκB proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues. The study provides computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.
Biomedical research has shown that a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is crucial for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which regulate this equilibrium, are a common feature in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN), the primary negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with ASDs. However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling.

Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) inputs regulate muscle activity, researchers found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic (but not cholinergic) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development.

Ketogenic diets (KGDs) have proven effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. However, the mechanisms underlying their action remain largely elusive. Researchers found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants.

The study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs. The findings demonstrate that mutations in daf-18, the C. elegans ortholog of PTEN, lead to defects in inhibitory GABAergic neurodevelopment without significantly affecting cholinergic excitatory signals. The results suggest that decreased activity of DAF-18/PTEN affects GABAergic development due to a downregulation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor activity.

The study also found that mutations in daf-18/PTEN and daf-16/FOXO result in developmental defects in GABAergic neurons, leading to altered morphology and function while leaving cholinergic motor neurons unaffected. The defects in the inhibitory transmission arise from the hyperactivation of the PI3K pathway, along with subsequent DAF-16/FOXO inhibition, in GABAergic neurons of daf-18/PTEN mutants. The substantial conservation of the main components of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans enhances the applicability of this model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment.
Summary
     The study investigated the role of innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. The researchers found that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes can inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, the study identified interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as a key mediator of inflammation that potently inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains.

     The study revealed that IL-1β activates the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus preventing syncytia formation. In vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium.

     The study demonstrated that IL-1β inhibits SARS-CoV-2-induced syncytia formation by activating the RhoA/ROCK pathway to initiate actin bundle formation at the cell-cell interface between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells. Importantly, IL-1β significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice in vivo.

     Fluorescence staining showed that SARS-CoV-2-infected lung epithelial cells fused with neighboring cells, promoting viral transmission in the airway epithelial cells, while IL-1β induced the formation of actin bundles to restrict syncytia formation and further viral transmission. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates and enriches RhoA to the cell-cell junction between SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and neighboring cells via the IL-1R-mediated signal to initiate actin bundle formation, preventing cell-cell fusion and viral spreading.

     The study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection and provides potential therapeutic targets for viral control. The findings suggest that proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1β, play a critical role in controlling viral infection by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion and viral transmission.
Summary
     Insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in Drosophila, the fruit fly, play a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, similar to mammalian pancreatic beta cells. Researchers used electrophysiological recordings to investigate how nutritional and internal state changes affect IPC activity in vivo. The study found that IPC activity is strongly modulated by the nutritional state, decreasing during starvation and increasing after refeeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, similar to the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application.

The researchers also discovered that diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (DH44PINs) respond to glucose perfusion, but do not affect IPC activity. However, other DH44Ns inhibit IPC activity. This suggests that populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis.

The study demonstrated that activating IPCs has a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduces starvation-induced hyperactivity, while activating DH44Ns strongly increases hyperactivity. These findings indicate that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state.

The research highlights the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but is influenced by multiple factors. The study provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of metabolic homeostasis and suggests that IPCs and DH44Ns work together to maintain glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to changes in the nutritional state. The findings have implications for our understanding of the regulation of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis in both Drosophila and mammals.
Scientists have developed a new method to visualize and study proteins in live human cells using a technique called endogenous tagging. This method involves adding a fluorescent tag to a protein within the cell, allowing researchers to track its movement and behavior in real-time. However, generating human cell lines with endogenous tags has been challenging due to the low efficiency of a process called homology-directed repair. To overcome this limitation, researchers used an engineered split protein called mNeonGreen to create a large-scale endogenous tag library in human cells.

    The split mNeonGreen protein consists of two fragments, mNG21-10 and mNG211, which can be reconstituted to form a functional fluorescent protein. By expressing the mNG21-10 fragment in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), researchers were able to efficiently tag multiple proteins with the mNG211 fragment. This approach enabled the creation of a high-quality endogenous tag library in human iPSCs, which can be used to study protein function in healthy cells and across different cell types.

    The researchers also demonstrated the ability to image iPSCs with high temporal resolution using a technique called CARE, allowing for the study of dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis. Cytokinesis is the process by which a cell divides into two daughter cells, and it is essential for cell growth and development. By using the split mNeonGreen system, researchers can now study this process in real-time, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying cell division.

    This work represents a significant step towards creating a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells, which will enable researchers to study protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro. The split mNeonGreen system provides a powerful tool for large-scale endogenous tagging, and its application in human iPSCs has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease mechanisms.
Researchers have developed a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions in the brain using chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes. This technique allows for controlled and repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology data. A custom-built current source provides stable current delivery throughout the lesion, enabling precise control over the extent and location of the injury. The method was validated using histology, current and voltage traces, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning.

The technique offers several advantages over traditional lesioning methods, including millimeter precision over the extent of the lesion and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury. It also permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This method can be used in various areas of the cortex, in multiple species, and with different types of multielectrode probes. The low-cost, external lesioning device can be easily integrated into existing electrophysiology recording setups.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this method using a linear multicontact probe in ex vivo rabbit cortex and showed that it can be used with passive multielectrode probes. The technique allows for small, permanent inactivation volumes while maintaining reliable neuroelectrophysiological recordings. The selection of electrical current pattern, amplitude, and duration, as well as the specific lesion electrodes' shape and location, offers many different combinations for complementary investigations into the causal role of cortical activity.

The method has been tested in various species, including rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus macaques, and can be easily adapted for use in smaller species, such as rats. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population's role in neuronal circuit function, while providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. The approach has the potential to advance our understanding of brain function and behavior, and can be used in various areas of neuroscience research.
Summary
     Bees play a crucial role in pollinating agricultural crops, but their populations are threatened by the use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids. These insecticides can contaminate floral nectar and pollen, posing a significant risk to bees. Research has yielded conflicting evidence on whether bees can detect and avoid neonicotinoids in sucrose solutions. To address this question, scientists conducted an experiment using a combination of behavioral assays and electrophysiology to investigate whether bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) can detect neonicotinoids in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed rape (Brassica napus).

     The study found that bumblebees did not avoid consuming solutions containing various concentrations of imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor, even when these solutions contained lethal doses of the pesticides. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered the activity of gustatory neurons in the bees' mouthparts, resulting in a slight reduction in firing rate or change in adaptation rate. These findings suggest that bumblebees are unable to detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of neonicotinoids using information from their mouthparts.

     The study's results are consistent with previous research that has shown that bees are not deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neonicotinoids. Bees have highly specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars, which are distinct from those reported in other insect species. The researchers also found that neonicotinoids in water did not elicit spikes in gustatory neurons, including those responsible for detecting nutrients and sugars. This suggests that bees are unable to taste neonicotinoids in nectar or water.

     The study's conclusions have implications for the use of neonicotinoids as a means of defending crops against pests without harming bees. If bees could detect and avoid neonicotinoids, these substances could be used to protect crops without posing a risk to bees. However, the current evidence suggests that bees are unlikely to detect neonicotinoids in nectar, putting them at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

     The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic era marked significant transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To understand how contemporary trophic interactions were influenced by host plant shifts and paleogeographical events, researchers integrated molecular data with information from the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. The analysis indicates that the crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinopsida (conifer) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead or decaying branches.

Belidae tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gondwana's breakup, surviving on distant and disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to angiosperms and Cycadopsida when and where conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. The two extant subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively, with Pinopsida being the most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae.

The analysis suggests that Belidae originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and subsequently colonized angiosperms as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. The two subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated and diverged during the separation of East and West Gondwana, and both have lineages that still develop on their ancestral host plant. The divergence time between Agnesiotis and Dicordylus in the East Gondwana clade, Belinae, was estimated at 44.7 million years ago, during the Paleocene-Eocene separation of South America and Australia.

Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhinotia (Australian region) and Proterhinus (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins. The analysis also suggests that angiosperm families known to be belid hosts, such as Arecaceae, Hydnoraceae, Balanophoraceae, and Fabaceae, did not diversify until the Cretaceous. During the early evolutionary history of Belidae, conifer lineages were dominant, consistent with Pinopsida being the most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding how tumors grow and evolve over time. One way to study this process is by analyzing the genetic mutations that occur within a tumor. In a recent study, researchers used high-resolution genetic data from hundreds of samples taken from resected hepatocellular carcinomas (a type of liver cancer) to gain insights into the early evolution of tumors in the body.

The researchers used spatial metrics to analyze the distribution of mutations within the tumors, which allowed them to infer how the tumors grew in earlier stages. They found that tumor cells grew predominantly uniformly throughout the tumor volume, rather than at the surface. This suggests that the growth of tumors is not limited to the outer layers, but rather occurs throughout the entire tumor.

The study also investigated how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumor, and how cell death contributes to the overall growth of the tumor. By analyzing the spatial distribution of mutations, the researchers were able to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumor evolution, including the growth rate and the interplay between tissue dynamics and genetic evolution.

The researchers used whole-exome mutation data from previously published studies (Ling et al., 2015; Li et al., 2022) to analyze the tumors. They developed metrics of intra-tumor heterogeneity that leveraged the information from the spatial position of all samples. This approach allowed them to infer how the tumors grew in earlier stages, providing new insights into the early evolution of tumors in the body.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of tumor growth and evolution, and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. The researchers' methods can be used to analyze the early evolution of tumors in vivo, and can provide valuable information for the development of new cancer treatments.

The study builds on previous research that has linked spatial tumor sampling with evolution, and provides new insights into the dynamics of metastasis (Jones et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2016; Alves et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2020). The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of the complex processes involved in tumor growth and evolution, and highlight the importance of spatial analysis in understanding these processes.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain organisms to adapt to changing environmental conditions through seasonal polyphenism, a phenomenon where an organism's physical characteristics change in response to seasonal variations. Cacopsylla chinensis, a type of insect, exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, transforming from a summer-form to a winter-form with distinct morphological features. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the temperature receptor CcTRPM play a crucial role in this transformation, affecting the insect's cuticle content and thickness. However, the underlying neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remained poorly understood.

    This study reveals a novel function of Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. The researchers identified two subunits of Bursicon, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β, which are regulated by low temperature and CcTRPM. These subunits form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness.

    The study also identified CcBurs-R as the Bursicon receptor, which plays a critical role in the upstream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis.

    The findings of this study provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor, shedding light on the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism. The study suggests that Bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development, and that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects. The research highlights the importance of further studies to understand how Bursicon mediates the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. A driver mutation in DMGs is the lysine to methionine substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M), which reshapes the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, researchers examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases (HDACs) and MYC in these tumors.

The study found that treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in a substantial decrease in cell viability. Transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed a synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulating prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination.

These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors. The study proposes a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigenetic and transcriptional pathways in H3-K27M-mutant DMG tumors. HDAC inhibition, in combination with the novel MYC inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic transcriptional signatures and reduced tumor growth in vivo. The findings emphasize epigenetic dependencies of H3-K27M-driven gliomas and highlight the therapeutic potential of combined treatments for this aggressive malignancy.

Previous studies have underscored the histone acetylation pathway as a potential drug target for this cancer. Pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat, were found to inhibit growth and restore gene expression alterations observed in H3-K27M malignant gliomas. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of epigenetic pathways affecting post-translational modifications of lysine 27 (methylation and acetylation) and lysine 4 (methylation) on histone H3.

High-level gene amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas. H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and MYC target genes, due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants, resulting in a viability dependency on MYC signaling. The PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, was shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma. To address the increasing need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs, the study tested whether dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation, using Vorinostat and Sulfopin, would yield beneficial outcome.
summary
     The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus is a key reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, the deermouse does not exhibit apparent disability or diminished fitness. To understand the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, researchers compared the genome-wide transcriptional responses of P. leucopus, Mus musculus (mice), and Rattus norvegicus (rats) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), an endotoxin that elicits inflammation.

     The results showed that P. leucopus had distinct LPS response profiles compared to mice and rats, characterized by non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. In contrast to mice and rats, P. leucopus displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics were also observed in a Borrelia hermsii infection model, suggesting that P. leucopus has a unique mechanism for infection tolerance.

     Further analysis revealed that P. leucopus had reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors, which may contribute to its ability to tolerate infections. The study also found that P. leucopus and mice had distinct profiles of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the blood, spleen, and liver, with P. leucopus exhibiting an "alternatively activated" or M2-type macrophage polarization phenotype, whereas mice showed a "classically activated" or M1-type polarization phenotype.

     Notably, P. leucopus had a more restrained transcriptional response to LPS compared to mice, with lower fold-changes in genes involved in leukocyte activation and migration. However, P. leucopus had greater fold-changes in genes involved in inflammation, such as Mmp8, Slpi, S100a9, and Il1b. These findings suggest that P. leucopus has evolved a unique mechanism for tolerating infections, which may be relevant to other animal reservoirs for human diseases.
Summary
     Caspases are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death. In humans, caspase 3 (CASP3) and caspase 7 (CASP7) recognize the same consensus motif, DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E (GSDME). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. The underlying mechanism of this observation was unclear.

     Researchers identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. The p10 subunit contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate CASP7, except in mammals.

     In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates, such as mice, but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates. The results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.

     The study found that a pufferfish GSDME, belonging to the teleost GSDMEa lineage, was specifically cleaved by both CASP3 and CASP7 at the site of DAVD to liberate the pyroptosis-inducing NT fragment. In teleost, there generally exist two GSDME orthologs, named GSDMEa and GSDMEb. The results suggest mutually independent evolution of GSDME and CASP7 in mice, which likely has distanced GSDME and CASP7 from each other. Similarly, human CASP7 and GSDME may also have undergone independent evolution, leading to the disengagement of GSDME from the substrate relationship with CASP7.

     The study identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis. Mutation of the cleavage site inhibited pyroptosis and significantly decreased LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage. These results indicated that TrCASP3/7 cleavage was required to activate TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis. The findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates.
A recent study investigated the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy participants to better understand its molecular mechanisms and inter-individual variability in response to the treatment. The study used a single-blind placebo-controlled design, where participants received an initial ketamine bolus followed by a continuous infusion. Resting-state functional connectivity was measured using data-driven global brain connectivity, and the results were related to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets.

The study found that both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine were multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability. The data-driven principal neural gradient effect of ketamine matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not. Additionally, behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level.

These findings highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry. The study's results suggest that a multi-dimensional approach is necessary to capture ketamine's acute effects and relate them to its hypothesized molecular mechanisms.

Ketamine has emerged as a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), with a response rate of around 65% in patients with TRD. However, individual differences in response to ketamine have been observed, and the relationship between ketamine's acute and delayed effects is complex. Previous studies have characterized ketamine's neural systems-level functional alterations using whole-brain approaches, demonstrating robust brain-wide effects, including increased global brain connectivity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in healthy controls and normalization of reduced PFC GBC in patients with major depressive disorder 24 hours post-ketamine.

The study's hypotheses were that ketamine would result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting inter-individual variability in response to ketamine, and that a multi-dimensional approach would allow for a closer relationship between ketamine's effects and its hypothesized molecular mechanisms, specifically SST and PVALB cortical gene expression maps. The study also investigated the extent to which multi-dimensionality is a property specific to ketamine by comparing it to two other psychoactive substances, psilocybin and LSD, which have shown preliminary clinical efficacy for the treatment of depression but have different pharmacological profiles.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-replicating units of life existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. However, the autonomous replication of such information carriers poses a problem due to the reduction in replication speed caused by product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands. To address this issue, researchers investigated the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under constant total population size and chemostat conditions.

The study found that large population sizes and small differences in replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the majority of replicator species, alleviating the error threshold problem relative to exponential amplification. Additionally, sequence properties, such as GC content, and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants. This suggests that fluctuations in building block availability may have favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation in the early evolution of life.

The researchers used a constant population model to investigate the diversity-maintaining mechanisms in parabolic regimes and demonstrated that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication. This proposes a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world.

Furthermore, the study considered a chemostat model of parabolic replication, taking into account monomer building block resources. The results showed that increased competition, mediated by a decrease in the resource influx rate, can induce a switch from coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest. The demonstrated diversity-maintaining mechanism of finite parabolic populations can be used as a plug-in model to investigate the coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators.

The findings suggest that replicating individuals in populations displaying parabolic growth kinetics are inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, a feature that can efficiently damp competition and promote coexistence. Parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit, providing a possible explanation for the preservation of viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and the provision of diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes.
Summary
     The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5), has been found to cleave human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TRMT1), a host enzyme responsible for a common post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. This cleavage results in the inactivation of TRMT1, leading to a decrease in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications in human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2. The cleavage site in TRMT1 matches the consensus sequence of Nsp5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins, and a single mutation within this sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The cleavage fragments of TRMT1 exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Furthermore, TRMT1-deficient human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular viral RNA compared to wild-type human cells. These findings suggest that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and perturbation of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with decreased TRMT1 levels and a reduction in m2,2G-modified tRNAs, and that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. The results provide evidence that TRMT1 is a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications. Additionally, the study found that TRMT1 is an endogenous cleavage target of Nsp5, resulting in methyltransferase inactive cleavage products, and that the putative cleavage site in TRMT1 includes a glutamine residue conserved at the fourth position, which is found in all Nsp5 cleavage sites of SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of TRMT1 in viral replication.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long been puzzled by the existence of microbes that are not inherently pathogenic, yet can cause disease when given the opportunity. One hypothesis is that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. To test this idea, scientists conducted an experiment with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast, to see if selection for adherence to a plastic surface would lead to increased virulence.

The researchers artificially selected yeast populations to adhere to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations, resulting in the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. These strains were then tested against wax moth larvae to measure their virulence. The results showed that the larvae injected with the evolved hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with non-multicellular strains.

This study supports the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, "accidental" pathogens. The researchers found that selection for adherence to a plastic surface led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence in the yeast. This is a common feature of organismal evolution, where selection on one trait can generate a correlated response in other traits. In this case, the correlated traits included those associated with virulence.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of pathogenicity and the potential for microbes to become opportunistic pathogens. The researchers suggest that the ability to adhere to surfaces, such as those found in industrial, medical, and domestic settings, may be a key factor in the evolution of virulence. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering the potential for "accidental" pathogenicity in microbes that are not inherently pathogenic. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between environmental selection and the evolution of virulence in microbes.
Scientists have discovered that proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains (PLDs) are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations, which can lead to the formation of abnormal biomolecular condensates. To understand the impact of these mutations on the stability of PLDs, researchers used a computational model called Mpipi to simulate the behavior of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins: hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1.

The simulations revealed the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and are applicable across the entire family of PLDs tested. The researchers found that the effects of successive mutations can be predicted by adding the effects of individual mutations, as long as the resulting mutation remains within the PLD composition and patterning biases.

The study demonstrates that scaling laws can be used to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates based on amino acid sequence mutations. The researchers employed a systematic approach to vary the amino acid sequence of the PLDs and determined how the phase behavior of PLDs changes with amino acid compositional perturbations. They analyzed three types of scaling laws for each type of mutation and found that the changes in the critical solution temperatures of PLDs can indeed be quantified by scaling laws, which are conserved across the family of PLDs investigated.

The study provides a quantitative framework to describe the phase behavior of a large set of protein variants via the identification of scaling laws. The researchers organized the data in a table to facilitate the interpretation of the scaling laws, which illustrates the effect of single-point mutations on the critical solution temperatures of the family of PLDs as a function of the PLD length. The results are consistent with experimental evidence and computational predictions, highlighting the importance of interactions involving aromatic residues in stabilizing condensates formed by PLDs. Overall, the study offers a new tool for predicting changes in the stability of PLD condensates and provides insights into the emergent behavior of PLD solutions in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules.
Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. Current approaches often rely on structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. However, these methods neglect the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. To address this limitation, researchers propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and combines it with the Fisher kernel. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, preserving the structure of the underlying model.

The HMM-Fisher kernel approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction. This method is shown to be accurate and reliable in predicting individual traits from brain dynamics models trained on neuroimaging data. The approach preserves the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is particularly important in studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous training and test sets.

The researchers demonstrate the potential of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach to leverage information from patterns of brain dynamics to predict individual traits in an example fMRI dataset and simulated data. They focus on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans acquired during wakeful rest. The parameters from these models are used to predict behavioral variables or traits.

The HMM is a probabilistic generative model of time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity dynamics. Despite its crucial role in interpreting model errors, reliability is not often considered in models predicting individual traits from neuroimaging features. The researchers show that using the Fisher kernel approach, which preserves the mathematical structure of the underlying HMM, can predict individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics accurately and reliably.

The HMM-Fisher kernel approach is compared to other prediction methods, including kernels that ignore the structure of the brain dynamics model, a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, and methods based on time-averaged functional connectivity. The results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach in predicting individual traits from brain dynamics models. This approach has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have been investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Crohn’s disease, which are associated with variants of the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene. Recent studies have shown that LRRK2 variants lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates, but the regulation of LRRK2 activity has remained poorly defined. To identify regulators of LRRK2 activity, a targeted siRNA screen was performed, which identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using imaging and immunopurification methods, researchers isolated lysosomes and demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation.

The study found that PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. These data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates at the lysosome. The researchers hypothesized that enhanced recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes may promote Rab phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of LRRK2 in proximity to its Rab substrates.

The study also examined whether two PD-linked genetic variants associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, had increased levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes. The results showed that Rab12, but not Rab29, regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and that Rab12 regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The study identifies Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity and demonstrates that it plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying PD and Crohn’s disease and highlight the importance of Rab12 in regulating LRRK2 activity.
Scientists have developed a new method to study the cell cycle of non-adherent cells, which are cells that do not stick to a surface, using a combination of a specialized surface, the FUCCI (CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach allows for precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells, which is crucial for understanding cellular biology and cancer research.

The new method was validated in two types of leukemia cell lines, NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics. The researchers tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells and found that the cell cycle analysis system provided detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. The system is also compatible with adherent cells, which are cells that stick to a surface, and is fully automated, making it a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development.

The cell cycle analysis system uses the FUCCI (CA)2 technology, which is a fluorescent indicator that demarcates cell cycle phases through color-coding. The system relies on two different software, Fiji and R, which are widely used by the imaging and data analysis community. The scripts for the image and data analysis workflows are publicly available, allowing researchers to customize the workflow according to their specific requirements.

The new method streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI (CA)2 indicator, making it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge. The system can analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per experimental condition, providing detailed insights into cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. This technology has the potential to revolutionize cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells. The system is also freely available, making it a valuable resource for the scientific community.
Using an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology, researchers investigated the relationship between brain structure and socio-ecological variables in 16 primate species. The study focused on the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which are involved in metacognition and working memory, respectively. The researchers used brain imaging data to examine the relationship between the size of these regions and a combination of socio-ecological variables, including body mass, daily traveled distance, and population density.

The results showed that the size of the FP and DLPFC, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance, and population density. This suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Notably, the FP volume was found to be more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, which is consistent with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions.

The study highlights the relative weight of social versus ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates. The findings support the ecological brain hypothesis, which proposes that brain size and structure are adapted to the specific ecological challenges faced by a species. The results also suggest that the size of the FP and DLPFC is related to the complexity of foraging strategies, with daily traveled distance being a significant predictor of DLPFC volume.

The study provides new insights into the relationship between brain structure and socio-ecological variables in primates, complementing laboratory studies and bridging the gap between cognitive neurosciences, behavioral ecology, and primate evolution. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of cognition in primates and highlight the importance of considering both social and ecological constraints in the development of cognitive abilities. Further research is needed to capture the metacognitive processes underlying social and foraging processes in the wild, as well as their interactions.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise. One key aspect of muscle growth is the radial growth of muscle fibers, which is characterized by an increase in cross-sectional area. However, it is unclear whether this growth is due to an increase in the size of individual myofibrils (myofibril hypertrophy) or an increase in the number of myofibrils (myofibrillogenesis).

To address this question, researchers developed a novel method called fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution (FIM-ID), which uses a standard fluorescence microscope to visualize myofibrils with high resolution and contrast. This method enabled the development of automated pipelines for measuring myofibril size and number. The researchers validated the accuracy of these measurements by comparing them to manual measurements obtained using electron microscopy (EM).

Using FIM-ID, the researchers found that the radial growth of muscle fibers in response to increased mechanical loading is largely due to an increase in the number of myofibrils (myofibrillogenesis), rather than an increase in the size of individual myofibrils (myofibril hypertrophy). This was observed in both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading.

The researchers used FIM-ID to analyze muscle biopsies from humans who had performed 7 weeks of progressive resistance exercise. They found that the number of myofibrils per fiber increased significantly after exercise, while the size of individual myofibrils did not change. This suggests that myofibrillogenesis is a key mechanism of muscle growth in response to increased mechanical loading.

The development of FIM-ID provides a time- and cost-effective means of studying muscle growth and myofibrillogenesis. The researchers believe that this method will be useful for a broad range of investigators studying muscle growth and development. Overall, the findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of muscle growth and have important implications for our understanding of muscle physiology.
summary
     Biomedical research has identified three mutations in the SNAP25 protein that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F, D166Y, and I67N. These mutations affect the protein's interaction with synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), a key player in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. In vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons, all three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion. The V48F and D166Y mutations led to a decrease in the readily releasable pool (RRP) size due to increased spontaneous release and decreased priming rates. In contrast, the I67N mutation decreased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes due to an increase in the energy barrier for fusion.

     The V48F and D166Y mutations increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion, whereas the I67N mutant decreased mEPSC frequency and evoked EPSC amplitudes. The RRP size was unaffected in the I67N mutant. These findings suggest that pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion. The preserved overall charge of evoked release in V48F and mild reduction in D166Y might point to a compensatory gain-of-function aspect to these mutations, in addition to the impaired Syt1 interaction.

     The role of Syt1 and Syt1:SNARE interactions in vesicle priming has been controversially discussed. The RRP is often assessed by applying a pulse of hypertonic solution to the neurons. Missense mutation in the SNARE bundle (I67N) leads to an increased amplitude of the energy barrier for fusion. Disease mutations display inefficient rescue of neuronal survival. Overall, SNAP25 encephalopathy caused by single missense point mutations presents with interdependent functional deficits, which must be overcome for successful treatment.

     In vitro analysis confirmed the increase in spontaneous release rate and decrease in evoked release by V48F and D166Y reported previously. Both mutations lower Syt1 association to SNARE-protein liposomes. These findings have consequences for our understanding of the simultaneous role of the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface in vesicle priming and release clamping. It further demonstrates the challenge faced by finding mechanism-based treatments of these disorders in the presence of multiple effects caused by single-point mutations. Part of the role of Syt1:SNARE interaction might be catalytic, lowering the energy level of a transition state along the path to priming, which will affect both rates. This might happen because transient binding to Syt1 might structure SNAP25 and assist in formation of the SNARE complex, whereas SNAP25 mutants might prestructure the protein, bypassing the need for Syt1.
Using data from 30 countries, a recent study has found a correlation between the proportion of women in a scientific discipline and the perceived quality of research in that field. Specifically, the study found that disciplines with a higher proportion of women tend to have lower research quality evaluations and lower funding success rates. This correlation holds true for both men and women, and is robust to factors such as age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures.

The study used independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers and 30 countries to examine research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores. The results showed a strong correlation between the evaluated quality of a researcher's work and the gender balance of their discipline. Researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines received lower evaluations, while those in male-dominated disciplines received higher evaluations.

The study also found that funding success rates displayed a similar correlation, with researchers in male-dominated disciplines having higher funding success rates than those in female-dominated disciplines. This was true for both men and women. The findings suggest that research from female-dominated disciplines is consistently evaluated as lower quality than research from male-dominated disciplines, which has a detrimental effect on everyone in those disciplines, but will disproportionately affect women.

The study's results are consistent with previous findings that women's work is valued less, regardless of who performs that work. The study's authors note that it is possible that the finding that research in female-dominated disciplines is evaluated as less good than research in male-dominated disciplines may be an outcome of feminization over time, but this could not be explored with the available data. The study's findings have implications for the evaluation and funding of research, and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors that influence research quality and funding success.
summary
     Scientists have developed a new strategy called P3 editing, which enables the control of genome editing in living cells using protein-protein interactions. This approach, termed P3 editing, links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, researchers have demonstrated that various known protein-protein interactions and chemically induced dimerization of protein domains can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. This strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells.

The P3 editing system is based on the dual-component gRNA of the native CRISPR-Cas9 system, but with the crRNA:tracrRNA dimerization domain replaced with two protein-binding RNA aptamers, such as MS2 and BoxB hairpins. This design mimics the functional molecules within the native CRISPR-Cas9 system, initially discovered as the dual-RNA-guided system. The P3 editing system has been shown to be efficient and specific, allowing for the control of genome editing via specific interactions between a pair of tagged protein domains.

Furthermore, researchers have explored the potential of P3 editing to incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. This could expand the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits. Additionally, molecular sensors can be used to control cellular function as components of synthetic biological circuits, and outputting molecular sensors to genome editing events may facilitate the design of such control structures.

Overall, the P3 editing strategy provides a powerful tool for controlling genome editing in living cells, enabling the design of synthetic molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs. This approach has the potential to expand the range of cellular activities that can be programmed by genome editing, and may lead to new applications in synthetic biology and biotechnology.
summary
     The KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex plays a crucial role in the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential in cardiomyocytes by mediating the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs). Mutations in this complex can cause long QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, which increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to activate KCNQ1 channels and increase IKs currents by binding to two different sites on the channel. This activation is thought to occur through a "lipoelectric mechanism," where PUFAs shift the voltage dependence of activation to more negative voltages and increase the maximal conductance of the channels (Gmax). However, the exact mechanism by which PUFAs increase Gmax is not fully understood.

     The KCNQ1 channel is a voltage-gated K+ channel that associates with the KCNE1 subunit to form the IKs current. This current is essential for the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Loss-of-function mutations in the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with LQTS, leading to a reduction in channel current and a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram. PUFAs have been shown to increase KCNQ1/KCNE1 maximum conductance by stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. This stabilization is thought to be the result of PUFAs promoting interactions between residues in the selectivity filter that favor the conductive conformation of the channel.

     The KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex has a small single-channel conductance and a low open probability, which contributes to the low IKs current. PUFAs have been shown to increase IKs currents by shifting the voltage dependence of activation and increasing Gmax. However, the exact mechanism by which PUFAs increase Gmax is still poorly understood. Further research is needed to fully understand the effects of PUFAs on KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels and their potential therapeutic applications in treating LQTS.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in various human brain disorders, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying this relationship remain poorly understood. A key enzyme, pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), controls the levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6. PDXP has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for vitamin B6-associated pathologies, but pharmacological inhibitors of this enzyme have been lacking. Researchers have now discovered a PDXP and age-dependent decline of PLP levels in the murine hippocampus, providing a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors.

Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, the researchers identified 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8-DHF increases PLP levels in a PDXP-dependent manner, validating PDXP as a druggable target. Notably, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, although its mechanism of action has been debated.

The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain. The researchers observed that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in the hippocampi of middle-aged mice, suggesting that therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not be sufficient to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive. The identification of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.

Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in the nervous system, with its status affecting cognitive function at any age. PLP deficiency has been associated with human brain disorders for decades, yet causal links remain unclear. The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor provides a potential therapeutic strategy to control intracellular PLP levels in the brain, offering new avenues for the treatment of vitamin B6-associated pathologies.
summary
     The development of the gonad in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a complex process that requires the coordinated production and migration of diverse cell types. The gonad's mirror-symmetric structure is guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which arise from the asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs) Z1 and Z4. Research has shown that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins: CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20. These Wnt proteins have distinct functions, with CWN-2 promoting normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, CWN-1 promoting reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively, and EGL-20 inhibiting the polarization of both Z1 and Z4.

In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 (RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs.

The study highlights the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. The results suggest that the distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 are a key factor in their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. The findings also demonstrate that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex processes involved in gonad development and the role of Wnt signaling in establishing a mirror-symmetric organ.
Researchers have been exploring the concept of tradeoffs in drug resistance, where resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable remains unclear. To investigate this, scientists conducted evolution experiments using yeast cells and the antifungal drug fluconazole. They used a technique called lineage-tracking to capture a wide range of mutations that provided a fitness advantage in the presence of the drug. The researchers then quantified the fitness tradeoffs for 774 evolved mutants across 12 different environments.

     The results showed that the mutants grouped into classes with distinct tradeoffs, suggesting that each group affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. Some mutants that resisted single drugs did not resist their combination, while others did. Additionally, mutants to the same gene had different tradeoffs than others. These findings highlight the complexity of relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments.

     By grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, the researchers reduced the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from over 774 to a manageable panel of six types. This allowed them to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness. The study's findings suggest that multidrug regimens that exploit tradeoffs may not be as straightforward as previously thought.

     The researchers used a high-throughput evolutionary approach to enumerate classes of drug-resistant mutants and their associated tradeoffs. They performed multiple laboratory evolutions in a range of fluconazole concentrations and sometimes in combination with a second drug to enhance the diversity of drug-resistant mutants. The results show that the mutations that provide the strongest fitness advantage often dominate evolution, making it difficult to capture a full spectrum of mutations.

     The study's primary goal was to count the number of different types of adaptive mutations, each defined by its unique tradeoffs. The results indicate that there are at least six distinct groups with characteristic fitness tradeoffs across the 12 environments surveyed. The findings have implications for the development of multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, the study guides efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation.
summary
     The central tendency bias, also known as contraction bias, is a phenomenon where the brain's judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy for the brain to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, another type of bias, known as recency bias or serial dependence, has also been observed, where the brain's judgment is influenced by the most recent sensory stimuli.

     Recent studies have suggested that both biases may be more related than previously thought. Research using an auditory delayed comparison task in rats found that when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. This suggests that the PPC plays a key role in modulating contraction bias.

     A model of the circuit involved in generating contraction bias was proposed, which suggests that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience produces short-term sensory history biases, leading to contraction bias. The model predicts that errors occurring at the level of individual trials are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory towards the sensory distribution's mean.

     The results of the study are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. The model was further validated by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task.

     Contraction bias has been repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities, where performance in perceptual tasks seems to reflect a shift of the working memory representation towards the mean of the sensory history. Biases towards the most recent sensory stimuli have also been documented. The proposed model suggests that contraction bias emerges as a statistical effect of errors in working memory, occurring due to the persisting memory of stimuli shown in the preceding trials. The integration of this persisting memory in the working memory module competes with that of the stimulus in the current trial, giving rise to short-term history effects.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a potential new target for improving lung cancer therapy: the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2). Previous studies have shown that PDLIM2 acts as a tumor suppressor that is often repressed in lung cancer, leading to cancer progression and resistance to chemotherapy and immunotherapy. To investigate this further, the researchers used human clinical samples and data to examine PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. They also developed an endogenous mouse lung cancer model and a clinically feasible nano-delivery system to test the therapeutic efficacy of systemically administered PDLIM2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPDLIM2).

     The results showed that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. Systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 demonstrated low toxicity, high tumor specificity, and antitumor activity, and significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. The combination of nanoPDLIM2 with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs led to complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice.

     Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). These findings established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other cold cancers.

     The researchers also tested whether nanoPDLIM2 could enhance the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and/or chemotherapeutic drugs. Systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 reversed the phenotypes caused by PDLIM2 repression and induced complete remission of all lung tumors in most mice without further increasing toxicity when combined with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. These findings provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers. The preclinical data also established a novel combination treatment of nanoPDLIM2, anti-PD-1, and chemotherapeutic drugs that induces complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals with a high safety profile. The researchers believe that these findings are applicable to other cancers, as PDLIM2 repression has been linked to numerous human cancers other than lung cancer.
Scientists have long known that animals must be able to assess the quality of their food in order to survive in challenging environments. However, the mechanisms that allow animals to evaluate food quality and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly are not yet fully understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a low-quality food evaluation assay system and used it to investigate how animals respond to poor-quality food.

     The study found that when animals are given heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli), a low-sugar food, it triggers a cellular response known as the unfolded protein response (UPRER) and an immune response. This response encourages animals to avoid the low-quality food. The researchers also discovered that the physiological system for evaluating low-quality food relies on the UPRER-innate immunity axis, particularly its neuronal function, which regulates feeding behaviors.

     Further investigation revealed that the UPRER-innate immunity axis assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals. The study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through the UPRER-innate immunity regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors.

     The researchers also found that animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment by supplementing their diet with sugar, which inhibits the UPRER-innate immunity regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study provides new insights into the role of the cellular stress response pathway as a physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments.

     The study's findings suggest that the slow physiological food evaluation system is an evolutionary adaptation mechanism for detecting nutrition deficiencies in food that was not detected by the quick sensory nervous system. The researchers propose that heat-killed E. coli may lack or contain altered levels of certain metabolites that activate or inhibit the UPRER and immunity, respectively. The study's results have important implications for our understanding of how animals evaluate food quality and adjust their feeding behavior in response to nutritional deficiencies.
Scientists have long recognized the importance of carbohydrates in various biological processes, but their role in modulating drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), remains poorly understood. GPCRs are a major class of proteins that respond to a wide range of signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and other molecules. In this study, researchers focused on P2Y purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a drug target involved in inflammation and immune responses, to investigate how carbohydrates activate GPCRs.

Using a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and functional studies, the researchers identified a specific binding site on P2Y14 for uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar molecules. They found that UDP-glucose, a type of sugar nucleotide, can activate the receptor by bridging two transmembrane helices, TM2 and TM7. The researchers also identified a conserved salt bridging chain, KDKE, between TM2 and TM7 that distinguishes different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine.

Further analysis revealed that the KDKE chain is a conserved functional motif for sugar binding in both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12). The researchers used this information to design three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12, demonstrating the potential for carbohydrate-based drug development for GPCRs. The study expands our understanding of how carbohydrates activate purinergic receptors and provides new insights for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs targeting GPCRs.

P2Y14 is a unique model system for studying carbohydrate modulation of GPCRs, as it is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, UDP-sugars. The researchers' findings suggest that the different arrangements of UDP-sugar-binding sites between P2Y14 and other sugar transferases may determine their sugar selectivity. The study also reveals a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif in both P2Y12 and P2Y14, shedding light on how carbohydrates regulate GPCRs.

The researchers' molecular models of different sugar nucleotides provide detailed information on carbohydrate activation and recognition of these receptors, which may inspire further carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs. However, the existence of other carbohydrate-binding motifs in GPCRs remains unknown, and further investigations are needed to add new concepts and physiological understanding to the field.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, it was observed that cancer mortality rates in several countries remained within historic levels, despite cancer being considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the United States. The researchers compared mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause (MC) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease.

The study found that nationally in 2020, multiple cause cancer mortality rose by only 3% over the pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to approximately 13,600 excess deaths. The mortality elevation was higher for less deadly cancers, such as breast, colorectal, and hematological cancers (2-7%), compared to cancers with a poor survival rate, such as lung and pancreatic cancers (0-1%). In contrast, there was a substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer's disease (19%).

To understand these differences, the researchers simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. The results showed that the observed mortality differences were primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19.

The study suggests that the lack of excess cancer mortality during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US may not be due to protection conferred by immunosuppression, but rather the competing mortality risk from cancer itself, especially for deadly types like pancreatic and lung cancers. The researchers propose that considering multiple cause-of-death records is essential to accurately reflect changes in coding practices associated with the emergence of a new pathogen. The study also highlights the importance of considering the size and age of the population living with cancer, as well as life expectancy under cancer diagnosis, in understanding mortality patterns during the pandemic.
The Smc5/6 complex, a core regulator of chromosome architecture, plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription in eukaryotic genomes. R-loops are common transcriptional by-products consisting of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes are not fully understood. This study demonstrates that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation, and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity.

The Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions, including active gene transcription and telomere length regulation. The complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during these processes and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops. The accumulation of R-loops in the chromosomes of yeast defective in both RNase H and the Smc5/6 complex is linked to severe growth defects.

R-loops are most frequently observed at highly transcribed genes but can also be formed at telomeres and near DNA replication forks. RNase H1 and RNase H2 are the primary enzymes responsible for the removal of R-loops in chromosomes, but recent studies suggest that RNase H2 is the only one that acts throughout the cell cycle. The Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels in the cellular response to R-loop formation: within and between pathways. It contributes to RNase H-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids from genomic DNA, and its role is substantial but not as extensive as that of RNase H enzymes.

This study reveals a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. The results demonstrate a direct and active involvement of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic chromosomes, highlighting its importance in maintaining genome stability and preventing the accumulation of toxic R-loops.
Researchers investigated the relationship between preserved communication abilities and healthy ageing in a study of 105 individuals aged 39-82 years. The study aimed to determine whether the age-typical loss of sensory acuity could be compensated for by an individual's preserved attentional neural filtering ability. The study used electroencephalographic and behavioural data to examine the longitudinal stability of this compensatory brain-behaviour link and its predictive value for individual change in listening behaviour.

The results showed that despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance remained stable over a two-year period. Additionally, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint, but not longitudinally. This suggests that neural filtering and listening behaviour follow largely independent developmental trajectories.

The study replicated the previously observed between-subjects brain-behaviour relationship, where an individual's neural filtering ability was found to impact their listening performance independently of age or hearing status. However, when analysed in a longitudinal sample of ageing listeners, the study did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain-behaviour links observed within each timepoint.

The researchers characterised the changes in hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance across the middle to older adult lifespan, as well as the longitudinal change from timepoint 1 (T1) to timepoint 2 (T2). They used linear mixed-effect models to test cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes with time, and quantified each measure's test-retest reliability as their T1-T2 Pearson's correlation.

The study found no systematic longitudinal change in neural filtering, consistent with the expectation that inter-individual differences in neural filtering are independent of age and hearing status. However, the longitudinal stability of the previously observed age- and hearing-loss-independent effect of neural filtering on both accuracy and response speed was not supported. The study's findings raise caution on the use of attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers investigated the relationship between the perception of taste and flavour, known as chemosensation, and the use of botanical drugs in ancient Greece and Rome. Chemosensation is the combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis, which enables animals to detect high-value foods and avoid toxins. The study aimed to determine whether the intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as specific tastes and flavours, could predict the therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient times. A tasting panel generated data on the chemosensory qualities of various botanical drugs, and phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models were applied to test the relationship between these qualities and the recorded therapeutic uses of the drugs.

     The results showed that chemosensation was strongly predictive of therapeutic use, with botanical drugs having high therapeutic versatility exhibiting simple yet intense tastes and flavours. Twenty-one out of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. The study found that, in addition to bitter-tasting medicines, starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs were also associated with versatility. The findings suggest that the uses of drugs in ancient Greece and Rome were based on observed physiological effects, which are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology.

     The researchers propose that chemosensation and underlying physiological effects mediated by chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology co-explained the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient times. The study provides an unprecedented insight into how chemosensation, in combination with physiological effects, guided human behaviour in pre-historic times and conditioned therapeutic expectations and humoral theory in historic times. The theory of humours was the principal underlying Western medicine from ancient Graeco-Roman times until the Industrial Age, but the study suggests that taste and flavour perception of botanical drugs links humoral theory to modern medicine. The study demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties, showing that chemosensory perception connects ancient therapeutic knowledge with modern science.

     Biomedical research has identified bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family as a leading cause of death due to sepsis in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. These bacteria, including non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri, are known to cause gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia. However, the mechanisms underlying their ability to enter the bloodstream remain poorly understood.

     Researchers have discovered that clinical isolates of these bacteria are rapidly attracted to sources of human serum. Using an injection-based microfluidics device, the study found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is mediated through chemotaxis, a process by which bacteria move towards a chemical stimulus, and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum.

     The study reports the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr, a chemoreceptor that recognizes L-serine, and identifies a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. The researchers found that Tsr is widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections.

     The study also found that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. The researchers define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and consumption of serum nutrients as "bacterial vampirism," which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

     The study's findings suggest that L-serine functions as a molecular cue that directs Salmonella toward serum, but nutrients present in serum other than L-serine provide the major growth advantages. The researchers also found that the bacterial attraction response to serum is robust and rapid, with the motile population reorganizing within 1-2 minutes of serum exposure to be significantly biased toward the serum source. The study's results provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the ability of Enterobacteriaceae to cause bloodstream infections and may have implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies.
biomedical researchers have identified a conserved genetic program that defines the cellular identity of male germ cells across animal species. This program is thought to have originated over 600 million years ago and has been retained throughout evolution. The researchers used network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species to identify the core components of this program. They found that approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes are required for the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell, with a third of these genes forming a deeply conserved genetic scaffold. This scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, the researchers uncovered 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies. The researchers propose that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact. They conclude that despite the rapid evolution of reproductive protein genes, the functional basis of metazoan male germ cell identity relies on an old, evolutionarily conserved genetic program that can provide relevant insight into spermatogenesis and human infertility. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the conserved male germ cell gene expression program and its implications for human reproductive health.
Biologists have long been interested in understanding how eukaryotic cells, such as the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, coordinate their flagellar beating to swim and steer. This study aimed to elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating. C. reinhardtii employs breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim and modulates the beating amplitudes differentially to steer. The synchrony of beating is supported by a mechanical connection between flagella, but how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony has remained elusive.

The researchers used a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum and found that the coordinated beating only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum. This asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. The study highlights a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and has implications for biflagellates' tactic behaviors.

Previous studies have shown that dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating is the basis of C. reinhardtii's tactic motility. Calcium has been speculated to facilitate such dynamic modulation, as it is involved in switching the beating mode. The researchers also developed a reduced stochastic model for the system to elucidate the mechanisms at the origin of the asymmetry. The model represents selective hydrodynamic loading and flagellar dominance in the coordinated beating.

The study employed oscillatory flows applied from an angle with respect to the cells' symmetry axis to exert biased loads on one flagellum. The results showed that the flagellar dominance and selective loading affect the coordinated flagellar beating. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to clarify the interplay between flows and flagella, reproducing all experimental observations. The findings suggest that the two flagella have differential roles in the coordination and imply that flagella are coupled to external flow only through the cis flagellum. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of flagellar coordination and has implications for understanding the tactic behaviors of biflagellates.
Summary
     Researchers investigated the underlying mechanism of the metabolic benefits associated with intermittent fasting. They found that intermittent fasting promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in the intestine, which in turn leads to the "beigeing" of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Beigeing is a process where white fat cells become more metabolically active, similar to brown fat cells, and increase energy expenditure.

The study showed that adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s into diet-induced-obese mice increased beigeing of white adipose tissue. Additionally, exogenous IL-22 was found to significantly increase beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Conversely, deficiency of the IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting.

Single-cell sequencing of sorted intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions suggested that intermittent fasting may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages.

These findings establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue and suggest that the ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. The study provides new insights into the complex relationship between the gut and adipose tissue, and highlights the potential therapeutic applications of targeting the ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis in the treatment of metabolic diseases. The results of this study demonstrate that intermittent fasting promotes beigeing of white adipose tissue through the intestinal ILC3-IL-22-IL-22R axis, providing a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue.
Biomedical researchers investigated the factors that influence defensive behavior in mice using a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. They paired a serial compound stimulus (SCS) consisting of a tone and white noise (WN) with footshock to examine how associative and non-associative mechanisms contribute to defensive responses. The SCS-footshock group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period and explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period on day 2 of conditioning. In contrast, control groups that received pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely exhibited jumping or darting during WN.

During extinction sessions, the paired group's tone-induced freezing decreased, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Notably, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings suggest that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression.

The researchers used a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits a continuum of consistent associative defensive responses during CS presentation, which is not typically observed in classical Pavlovian conditioning. The study highlights the importance of considering both associative and non-associative factors in understanding defensive behavior. The results demonstrate that associative factors are necessary for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression, while non-associative factors contribute to some defensive responsiveness. The findings have implications for understanding the neural mechanisms underlying defensive behavior and may inform the development of new treatments for anxiety disorders.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding how insects navigate their environment and keep track of their orientation. One key aspect of this navigation is the ability to encode head direction, which has been shown to be represented by a sinusoidal activity pattern in a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or if it provides a specific functional advantage.

     To address this question, researchers established the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and found that many circuits can perform this function with different activity patterns. Among these patterns, the sinusoidal one was found to be the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons.

     The researchers compared their predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding a strong agreement. They also demonstrated that the predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, which means that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but can develop during development.

     The study suggests that the consistent presence of the eight-column organization of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artifact but can be explained by basic evolutionary principles. The researchers also found that the position-integrating neurons in these insects are predicted to have sinusoidal activation patterns, which is consistent with previous electrophysiological and calcium imaging studies.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying insect navigation and suggest that the sinusoidal encoding of head direction may be a common motif in insect navigation due to its noise-resilient properties. The research also highlights the importance of Hebbian plasticity in the development of neural circuits and provides a framework for understanding the evolution of complex neural systems.

     The study's results have implications for our understanding of insect navigation and may also be relevant to the study of navigation in other animals, including mammals, which encode heading in a fundamentally different way. Further research is needed to compare the encoding of direction in insects with that of mammals and to explore the potential applications of the study's findings in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence.

     Biomedical research has shown that obligate parasites often induce significant changes in their hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these extended phenotypes remain unclear. A recent study investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for inducing leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants, but previous research suggested that the insects were attracted to leaves rather than the flowers.

     The current study made a surprising discovery that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, indicating a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, SAP54 alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. The study found that SAP54 suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to males. The host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase (SVP) emerged as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP.

     The study demonstrated that SVP is essential for the female preference to male-exposed SAP54 plants. Leafhopper females exhibited a preference for reproducing on SVP null mutant plants, contingent upon the presence of leafhopper males. SAP54 mediates the degradation of SVP in leaves, promoting the abundance of phytoplasma-carrying insect vectors and facilitating phytoplasma transmission. This highlights how a bacterial gene extends its influence beyond its primary plant host to modulate the host choice and reproductive behavior of the insect vector.

     The research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction, integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. SAP54 acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. The study provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes and opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.
Summary
     Candida albicans, a common human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health due to its ability to develop resistance to antifungal treatments. Researchers used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to study the response of C. albicans to antifungal drugs at the single-cell level. The study aimed to characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of drug tolerance in C. albicans.

     The researchers profiled the transcriptomes of thousands of individual C. albicans cells that were either untreated or exposed to the antifungal compound fluconazole ( FCZ ). The results showed that the cells exhibited heterogeneous expression patterns that correlated with cell cycle stage, with distinct metabolic and stress responses. After 2 days of FCZ exposure, the surviving cells bifurcated into two major subpopulations : the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state and the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state. The Rd state was characterized by the upregulation of genes involved in ribosome assembly, rRNA processing, and mitochondrial cellular respiration, while the Sd state was enriched for genes related to stress responses.

     The bifurcation of the cells into these two subpopulations persisted at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. The researchers also found evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) was activated in these subpopulations, which may facilitate cell survival. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of antifungal drug tolerance in C. albicans and highlights the importance of studying the response of individual cells to antifungal drugs.

     The use of a nanoliter droplet-based assay allowed for the detailed analysis of C. albicans cells in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs over a period of days. This approach provided a cost-effective and reliable method for studying the response of individual cells to antifungal compounds. The results of this study align with previous reports that associate cell cycle phase with the expression of stress response and metabolism-related genes. The findings of this study have implications for the development of new antifungal treatments and highlight the need for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying antifungal drug tolerance in C. albicans.
biomedical research article summary
     The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution suggests that species vary in the effectiveness of selection, with the census population size determining the minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be purged and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, effective population size is often estimated from putatively neutral genetic diversity, but this measure may not accurately capture a species' effectiveness of selection.

     A potentially more direct measure of selection effectiveness is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics comparing codon bias across species are confounded by among-species variation in GC content and/or amino acid composition. To address this issue, the authors propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS) based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, which corrects for both confounders.

     The CAIS is an extension of the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI), using information-theory-based Kullback-Leibler divergence to correct for GC and amino acid composition. This new metric can be calculated without data on polymorphism or mutation rate, without selecting reference genes, and without concerns about demographic history. The authors demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations and the Effective Number of Codons (ENC) to show that protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder.

     The authors posit that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of both genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias. Codon adaptation metrics more directly quantify how species vary in their exquisiteness of adaptation than estimates of effective population size based on neutral polymorphism. Both CAIS and ENC can be estimated for more species because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data, nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances, but only a single complete genome.

     The authors developed a new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates. They chose vertebrates due to the abundance of suitable data and as a stringent test case, given past studies finding limited evidence for codon adaptation. The degree of bias in synonymous codon usage driven by selective preference offers a more direct way to assess how effective selection is at the molecular level in a given species. This can be estimated from only a single genome, without polymorphism or mutation rate data for that species.
Sepsis is a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization (WHO), resulting in millions of deaths worldwide each year. The condition is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory immune response, highlighting the need for strategies to target inflammation. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a key mediator of inflammation, released by both inflamed host cells and tissues, as well as by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. This study investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP and its role in sepsis pathogenesis.

Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli), researchers demonstrated that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. Additionally, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, the local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase that hydrolyzes ATP for release. Abrogating bacterial ATP release showed that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival.

Furthermore, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulate expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. The study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. E. coli, a frequent facultative pathogen in patients with abdominal sepsis, released the highest amount of ATP in a standardized mouse model of abdominal sepsis.

The study found that ATP release is dependent on ATP generation and that released bacterial ATP suppresses abdominal inflammatory responses and worsens survival in a model of abdominal sepsis. ATP is rapidly metabolized in the extracellular space, limiting its mode of action to the immediate cellular vicinity. The study also investigated the role of ATP released by bacteria invading non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or blood, in the context of local and systemic infections. The results show that sepsis-associated bacteria release ATP in a growth-dependent and strain-specific manner, with E. coli releasing notably more cumulative ATP compared to E. faecalis and S. aureus. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its role in sepsis pathogenesis.
Using a large-scale longitudinal dataset of 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study, researchers investigated the relationship between genetic and environmental factors, cognitive intelligence, and psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in children. The study found that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs were significantly associated with lower polygenic scores (PGSs) for cognitive phenotypes, lower familial socioeconomic status (SES), lower neighborhood SES, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence was found to mediate the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs.

The study employed linear mixed models and a novel structural equation modeling (SEM) method to examine the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs mediated by cognitive intelligence. The researchers investigated the mediating role of cognitive intelligence within the impacts of cognitive phenotype PGSs, high family SES, low neighborhood SES, and positive family and school environments on PLEs.

The results showed that higher PGSs of cognitive capacity phenotypes were significantly correlated with higher intelligence, while lower PGSs were associated with lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs. The study also found that gene-environment interactions had significant effects on cognitive intelligence and PLEs, with cognitive phenotypes PGS adjusting for schizophrenia PGS showing a significant association with cognitive deficit in psychosis patients and individuals at-risk of psychosis.

The study's findings underscore the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs through their effects on cognitive intelligence. The results suggest that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children. The study's policy implications highlight the importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities and promoting supportive environments to reduce the risk of PLEs and other mental health issues in children. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationships between genetic and environmental factors, cognitive intelligence, and PLEs in children.
Using human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro model, researchers investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling in early fetal telencephalic development. FGF8 is a morphogen that plays a crucial role in establishing positional cues and regional cellular responses during embryonic development. The study aimed to elucidate the effects of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation in human cerebral organoids.

The results showed that FGF8 treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, leading to the formation of distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains within multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic regions, FGF8 affected the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Furthermore, FGF8 efficiently modulated key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders.

Transcriptomic analysis revealed a clear FGF8-mediated induction of ventral telencephalic genes, suggesting that one of the primary roles of FGF8 signaling is the promotion of ventral identity. The upregulation of ventral genes such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX3, and the downregulation of dorsal genes like EMX1, NEUROG2, SOX5, and LHX2, supported this finding.

The study demonstrated that FGF8 treatment leads to altered regional identities in 3D organoids compared to untreated controls, resulting in the development of multi-regional organoids with distinct co-developing brain domains. FGF8 efficiently modulated NR2F1 and other genes associated with brain disorders in human FOXG1+ telencephalic cells, underscoring its critical role in the fine-tuning of key neurodevelopmental and pathogenic pathways.

The findings highlight an FGF8-dependent effect on regional identity, along with the modulation of several neurodevelopmental disorder-related targets, including an evolutionarily conserved FGF8-NR2F1 molecular axis. The study proposes that FGF8-mediated modulation of key developmental genes guides the developmental trajectories of human brain cells along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior telencephalic axes. The ability of FGF8 to modulate target genes can vary based on the regional identity of the FGF8-exposed cells, and the co-presence of various regional domains in FGF8-treated organoids represents a significant outcome.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that sleep and feeding patterns in developing organisms, such as Drosophila larvae, lack strong daily rhythms early in life. As these animals mature, feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. However, the cues that trigger the development of this clock-arousal circuit are unknown. A recent study has identified a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae. The study found that in the 2nd instar larval period (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day, but by the 3rd instar larval stage (L3), these behaviors become organized into daily patterns. Forcing mature (L3) animals to adopt immature (L2) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit long-term memory (LTM). The development of the clock (DN1a) -arousal (Dh44) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Furthermore, the study demonstrated that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive the onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. These findings suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors. The study also investigated how developing larvae detect changes in their nutritional environments to drive the circadian consolidation of sleep and feeding at the L3 stage. It was found that Dh44 neurons act as nutrient sensors to regulate food consumption and starvation-induced sleep suppression through the activity of both glucose and amino acid sensing genes. The emergence of daily sleep-wake patterns is regulated by developmental changes in energetic capacity, and Dh44 neurons may be necessary for sensing of larval nutritional environments. The study also identified the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae. The development of this circuit promotes deeper sleep in L3, resulting in the emergence of long-term memory (LTM) capabilities at the L3 stage but not before. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the development of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors in Drosophila larvae.
Biologists have long observed that many animals moving through fluids, such as fish swimming in schools, exhibit highly coordinated group movement that is thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct energetic measurements demonstrating the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements have remained elusive. A recent study on giant danio fish (Devario aequipinnatus) has shed light on this phenomenon by characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of fish.

The study found that fish schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism-speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at approximately 1 body length per second. This indicates that fish swimming in schools reduce their total energy expenditure (TEE) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed, fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, resulting in a 53% lower TEE and total cost of transport.

The study also found that fish in schools recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance, which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes.

The researchers used a high-drag viscous aquatic medium as a model to understand how group movement by animals can be more energy-efficient than movement by isolated individuals. By increasing maximum aerobic performance, fish schools save anaerobic energy and reduce the recovery time after peak swimming performance. The study's findings support the hypothesis that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement, leading to reduced non-aerobic energetic costs and time of recovery for schooling fish swimming at speeds occupying the majority of their aerobic capacity.

The study directly measured both aerobic and non-aerobic energy used by schooling fish over a wide range of water velocities and compared the swimming performance curve to that of solitary fish. The results show that both solitary fish and fish schools have a concave upward shaped aerobic metabolic rate-speed curve over the lower portion of their speed range. However, fish schools swimming at approximately 1 body length per second consume less energy than at slower speeds, indicating a minimum metabolic cost at this speed. The study's findings provide new insights into the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements and may have implications for understanding the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in animals.
Summary
     Airway macrophages (AM) play a crucial role in preventing infection in the lung and are a target for host-directed therapy. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, particularly in lung-resident AM. To address this, researchers examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in their resting state and after priming with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung.

     The study found that human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. However, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM, which shifted to a "Warburg"-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM, and blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ-driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis.

     Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. The study provides evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.
Scientists have discovered that nocturnal bull ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon to navigate during the night. This is the first time this ability has been observed in any animal. The moon's polarized light pattern is much dimmer than the sun's, but it can still provide directional information to the ants. The researchers found that the ants use this cue to navigate home during the night, even when the sun is hidden by clouds or the horizon.

The study focused on nocturnal bull ants, which leave their nest at twilight and rely on the overhead solar polarized light pattern to navigate. However, many of these ants return home overnight when the sun is no longer visible. The researchers demonstrated that the ants use polarized moonlight to navigate home during the night by rotating the overhead polarized light pattern above the ants and observing their response. The ants altered their headings in response to the polarized moonlight, indicating that they use this cue to navigate.

The researchers also found that the ants can detect polarized moonlight throughout the lunar month, even when the moon is in its crescent phase and the polarized light levels are at their lowest. This suggests that polarized moonlight is a consistent and reliable cue for the ants. Furthermore, the study showed that the ants incorporate the polarized moonlight pattern into their path integration system throughout the night, just as they do with polarized sunlight during the day.

This ability to detect polarized moonlight has been theorized to be present in other nocturnal insects, such as bees and crickets, but this study provides the first behavioral evidence of its use in goal-directed navigation. The researchers suggest that polarized moonlight is likely detected and integrated into the ant's path integrator through the same visual pathways as polarized sunlight, allowing the ants to use the same underlying neural architecture for both cues. This study provides new insights into the navigation abilities of nocturnal animals and highlights the importance of polarized light in their navigation systems.
summary
     Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. The tails of early pterosaurs ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial for early pterosaur flight, but the mechanism by which this was achieved was unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats.

     Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to examine the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. Over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils were examined for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch, and four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence. The imaging revealed a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. This lattice supported a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system that maintained vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.

     The discovery of the cross-linking lattice in the tail vanes of early pterosaurs provides new insights into the evolution of flight in these animals. The lattice suggests that early pterosaurs used a dynamic tensioning system to maintain vane stiffness, which would have improved their flight control and maneuverability. The loss of vanes in later pterosaurs and their absence in birds and bats may be related to changes in flight style or the evolution of other control mechanisms.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of flight in vertebrates. The discovery of the cross-linking lattice in the tail vanes of early pterosaurs highlights the importance of dynamic tensioning systems in maintaining vane stiffness and improving flight control. Further research is needed to fully understand the evolution of flight in pterosaurs and the role of the tail vane in this process.
summary
     Adolescence is a critical period of development characterized by significant changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These changes are essential for transitioning into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. Research suggests that major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence underlies these behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. This study aimed to investigate differences in dopamine release and the underlying mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of adolescent and adult male rats.

     The study used fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release in the NAc core of adolescent (P28-35) and adult (P70-90) male rats. The results showed baseline differences in dopamine release between adult and adolescent rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood.

     Blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that the α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. The study confirmed the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis. The results suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release.

     The study found that stimulated dopamine release is decreased in the NAc core of early adolescent male rats, and this effect is driven by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine release through both acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs and GABA tone. The results also suggest that GABA and nAChRs have a complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release that may be age/developmental stage-dependent. The study used microdialysis in awake rats to confirm that the age-dependent differences in male dopamine release are mediated by a GABA mechanism involving α6-containing nAChRs in vivo. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms driving age-related differences in dopamine release and may have implications for understanding the development of psychiatric disorders.
(summary)
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the underlying causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a complex condition characterized by distinct behavioral traits. Recent studies using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have provided new insights into the developmental abnormalities associated with ASD. A recent study investigated the neural precursor cells (NPCs) of individuals with two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion, and found common reductions in neurite outgrowth and migration. Notably, despite the absence of genetic overlap between the two subtypes, the study identified hundreds of shared phospho-peptides, including those involved in the mTOR signaling pathway.

     Further analysis revealed that mTOR signaling alterations were present in NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and modulation of the mTOR pathway rescued ASD-associated phenotypes in both subtypes. This suggests that mTOR signaling dysregulation is a shared pathogenic mechanism underlying the developmental defects observed in ASD. The study also found enrichment of the ERK/MAPK and PKA pathways, indicating that altered cellular signaling plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).

     To investigate the role of mTOR signaling in ASD, the researchers conducted gain and loss of function studies on NPCs from both subtypes. Increasing mTOR pathway activity rescued ASD defects in individuals with low mTOR levels, while reducing mTOR pathway activity reproduced autism NPC phenotypes. Conversely, decreasing p-S6 in high mTOR ASD NPCs rescued ASD-associated phenotypes. These findings suggest that mTOR signaling dysregulation is a key driver of the developmental abnormalities observed in ASD.

     The study's results have significant implications for our understanding of ASD, highlighting the importance of shared pathogenic mechanisms across different subtypes. The identification of mTOR signaling as a common point of convergence for the shared ASD neurite and migration phenotypes provides a potential therapeutic target for the development of treatments for ASD. Further research is needed to fully explore the role of mTOR signaling in ASD and to translate these findings into clinical applications.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the diversity in structure and function of afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea plays a crucial role in the encoding capacity of the auditory circuitry. The synapses on the pillar side of IHCs, which have more presynaptic Ca2+ channels, activate at lower IHC potentials compared to those on the modiolar side. Postsynaptic SGNs also exhibit differences in their spontaneous firing rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges.

     To investigate the causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity, researchers conducted ex vivo paired recordings of murine IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons using stimuli and conditions that mimic in vivo SGN characterization. The results showed that synapses with high spontaneous rates of release (SR) were predominantly found on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates.

     The study found that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. The researchers used step depolarizations to emulate physiological receptor potentials, which are essential for in vivo characterization of sound encoding by SGNs. The results suggest that the heterogeneity of afferent synapses between IHCs and SGNs is a key mechanism for decomposing acoustic information in the cochlea.

     The study highlights the challenges in bridging the gap between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding. However, the findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of SGN firing diversity in the cochlea. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of SGN firing diversity and to understand how synaptic heterogeneity contributes to the encoding capacity of the auditory circuitry.
Summary
     The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, undergoes significant environmental challenges during its lifecycle stages, necessitating the regulation of chromatin accessibility for transcriptional control. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across various kingdoms, including plants and animals. Recent studies have highlighted the role of MORC proteins as transcriptional switches in apicomplexan parasites.

     This study employed CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and complementary molecular and genomics approaches to investigate the function of PfMORC in P. falciparum. The results demonstrate that PfMORC modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite's erythrocytic cycle and is essential for parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments revealed that PfMORC binds to sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition.

     Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies showed that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure, leading to parasite death. These findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.

     The study used CRISPR/Cas9 genomic editing to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC throughout the parasite's intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC). Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validated the role of PfMORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. Genome-wide distribution and regulatory impacts of PfMORC on the parasite chromatin, transcriptome, and cell cycle development were assessed using ChIP-seq in duplicate at the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages.

     The results demonstrate that PfMORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and survival but also has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation. These findings provide powerful evidence for the essentiality of PfMORC in P. falciparum and validate this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an investigation into the role of nerves infiltrating tumors in these alterations. A study using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas, forming a neuronal circuit. The activation of this circuit altered behaviors in the mice, including decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running. The study also found that tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos and increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts.

The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. However, analgesic treatment restored normal function at the tumor site, such as nesting behavior, but only partially restored normal voluntary running wheel behavior. This suggests that, in addition to pain, tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior.

The study found that the tumor-brain connection occurs independently of pain and drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. The elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, but also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. The absence of nociceptor neurons in tumor-bearing animals decreased cFos and ΔFosB in the PBN and ΔFosB in the SpVc, suggesting that the tumor-brain communication was disrupted in the absence of nociceptor neurons.

The study demonstrates that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit that extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. The findings suggest that the neural connection between tumor and brain, together with the functional alteration of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons within this circuit, might contribute to the changes in mental health experienced by cancer patients and survivors. The study highlights the importance of unraveling the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain to develop targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer.
Summary
     Scientists have analyzed the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact on the biophysical properties of the nucleocapsid protein (N-protein). The N-protein is a highly expressed and multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in the virus's life cycle. The researchers used a large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 to examine how mutations in the N-protein's amino acid sequence affect its biophysical properties.

     The study found that variations in the physicochemical parameters of the N-protein's intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) allow for local plasticity, but also impose functional constraints that are similar to those found in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, the researchers observed that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impacts on the protein's thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation.

     The study also found that in the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects that shift the balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties. This includes the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. The results suggest that genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, particularly in the IDRs.

     The researchers used computational methods to evaluate the range of biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein's folded domains and IDRs across the observed mutant spectrum, as well as related coronaviruses. They also conducted biophysical experiments with several representative N-protein mutants derived from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern to characterize their variation in thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, energetics of NA binding, assembly, and liquid-liquid phase separation propensity.

     The study found that a large biophysical parameter space is available for viable N-protein, with the potential for mutations to exert nonlocal effects modulating overall protein biophysical properties. The researchers conclude that exploiting the emerging mutational landscape and sequence space presents both a challenge and opportunity to explore the biophysical phenotype spectrum and uncover the salient functional principles of RNA-virus proteins.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding the mechanisms behind hibernation, a state of metabolic suppression that allows small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. A recent study aimed to investigate whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo changes during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. The researchers isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus) and larger hibernators (Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus) and conducted experiments to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand.

The results showed that myosin structure was preserved in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, but in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor led to higher levels of energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures (20°C). However, when the experiments were repeated at 8°C, near the body temperature of torpid animals, myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, the researchers observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemlineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule and mitigate myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure.

The study also found that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Furthermore, the researchers observed that myosin is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potential contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis. These findings suggest that myosin plays a crucial role in the adaptation of skeletal muscle to hibernation, and that changes in myosin metabolic states may be an important mechanism for energy conservation during periods of torpor. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying hibernation and has implications for our understanding of energy metabolism in mammals.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long understood that chondrocyte columns play a crucial role in bone elongation, particularly in the growth plates of developing bones. These columns are formed when chondrocytes, the cells responsible for cartilage production, undergo clonal expansion following a complete rotation of their division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. However, a recent study has challenged this understanding by analyzing the 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice.

Using a combination of 3D imaging and morphometric analysis, the researchers found that most chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate do not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation. Instead, incomplete rotations of the division plane result in non-stereotypic cell stacking, giving rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis. These clusters are composed of cells that have undergone successive incomplete rotations during cell division.

Further analysis revealed that both clusters and columns are present in the growth plates of postnatal mice, with complex columns composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. The study also found that the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns correlate with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development.

The researchers propose that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determine the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. This work provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development, highlighting the importance of 3D analysis in understanding complex cellular arrangements. The findings suggest that clusters may promote expansion, while columns support elongation, providing a new understanding of the intricate processes involved in bone growth and development.
Scientists have been interested in proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) due to their ability to improve the oral bioavailability of various classes of drugs. These transporters are found across all kingdoms of life and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Recent studies using cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have provided new insights into the conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and SLC15A2. However, these studies left open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling.

     To address these questions, researchers used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map out the full conformational cycle of SLC15A2 and its thermodynamic driving forces. They computed conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the presence or absence of peptide substrate, identifying a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. The simulations revealed key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which were validated experimentally in cell-based transport assays.

     The study also used constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations to establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underlying secondary active transport in POTs. The results provide a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and pave the way for integrating knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.

     The researchers constructed a model of the alternating access mechanism of POTs using recent bacterial and mammalian peptide transporter structures. They explained how the movement of two protons through the transporter drives accompanying conformational changes and how conformational changes and proton-movement events are coupled to the presence of substrate. The study established several distinct effects of the presence of substrate, linking ligand binding with protein conformational changes and protonation of titratable residues.

     To investigate the mechanism of peptide-proton coupling, the researchers calculated the affinity of a bound Ala-Phe substrate molecule using ABFE simulations in different protein states. They found that the affinity is similar in the OF and IF states, indicating that the binding of substrate alone does not thermodynamically drive the transporter from OF to IF. The study employed enhanced sampling simulations to obtain conformational free energy landscapes in dependence on a range of protonation states and substrate binding conditions, providing a detailed model of a plausible sequence of steps for substrate and proton-coupled alternating access in mammalian POTs.
Scientists have long believed that the brain suppresses neural responses in the auditory cortex during vocalization to increase sensitivity to auditory feedback, allowing for the detection of speech errors. This hypothesis has been confirmed in non-human primates, but its direct link to human speech monitoring has remained unclear. To investigate this, researchers used intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. They first mapped the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Next, they used a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations.

The results showed that overlapping sites in the STG exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback, with a strong correlation between the two measures. This supports the hypothesis that auditory suppression increases sensitivity to speech errors in humans. Furthermore, the study found that delaying auditory feedback during speech production enhanced auditory responses in the STG, and the degree of sensitivity to feedback delays was variable across different recording sites. A significant correlation was observed between speech-induced suppression and feedback sensitivity, providing evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and speech monitoring.

The researchers also found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if they were engaged in a DAF paradigm, suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity. This indicates that the brain's ability to detect and correct speech errors is closely linked to the suppression of neural responses in the auditory cortex during vocalization. The study's findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying human speech monitoring and suggest that auditory suppression plays a key role in detecting and correcting speech errors.
Scientists have conducted a comprehensive analysis of McrBC systems, a common type of prokaryotic defense mechanism, and identified a previously uncharacterized branch known as coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoCoNuTs). These systems are found in diverse prokaryotes and exhibit a wide range of genomic associations. CoCoNuTs are characterized by the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases, and they show extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes.

Further investigation revealed that CoCoNuTs contain domains capable of interacting with translation system components, such as the SmpB-like OB-fold, Hsp70 homologs, and YTH domains, as well as RNases like HEPN. This suggests that CoCoNuTs target RNA, and some may also target DNA via McrC nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III, are often encoded in the same predicted superoperons as CoCoNuTs.

The CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides or RNA fragments with cyclic termini that bind associated CARF domains. Researchers propose that CoCoNuTs, along with ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy similar to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. This strategy involves an initial immune response to eliminate viral DNA and/or RNA, followed by an abortive infection response leading to programmed cell death or dormancy via host RNA cleavage if the initial response fails.

Phylogenetic analysis of CoCoNuTs reveals a complex structure, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes that differ in their domain compositions and genomic associations. The RNA targeting capability of some CoCoNuTs can be inferred from their similarity to Type III-A in encoding CnuD Hsp70-like proteins. Higher-order associations of Type II and Type III-A CoCoNuT systems with various DNA restriction systems suggest a two-pronged DNA and RNA restriction strategy reminiscent of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. The conserved association of CDC48-like ATPases with Type III-A CoCoNuTs, which encode the potentially tmRNA-binding SPB domain, supports the scenario of tmRNA interaction. Structural analysis of the bacteriocin-like protein encoded in these loci indicates that it adopts an inactivated PD-(D/E)xK-type restriction endonuclease fold, potentially nucleic acid-binding.
Summary
     Calcineurin, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. In Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), calcineurin is involved in regulating the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP), which is essential for maintaining intestinal health. Research has shown that inhibition of calcineurin leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection.

The study found that calcineurin inhibition also mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Additionally, the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan.

Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, and increased amounts of calcium ions activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin. The rhythmic DMP cycle in C. elegans is known to be regulated by rhythmic calcium waves.

The study also examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on C. elegans innate immunity. Surprisingly, the knockdown of tax-6, the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection despite enhancing lifespan. Tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP).

Calcineurin has been shown to regulate various processes in C. elegans, including thermotaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan. Knockdown of tax-6 is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan via multiple pathways, including autophagy and CREB-regulated transcriptional coactivators (CRTCs). The relationship between lifespan and innate immunity appears to be complex and remains to be fully understood.
Researchers investigated how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory input or internal representations, and it is unclear how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts. According to the cognitive space theory, different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions.

The study aimed to test the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation by designing a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, suggesting that cognitive space is a principle for representing conflicts.

The researchers hypothesized that different types of conflicts are represented as points in a cognitive space, with the distance between the points reflecting the geometry of the cognitive space and scaling with the difference in the sources of the conflicts. The dimensions in the cognitive space of conflicts can be the aforementioned domains, in which domain-specific cognitive control processes are defined. For a specific type of conflict, its location in the cognitive space can be parameterized using a limited number of coordinates, which reflect how much control is needed for each of the domain-specific cognitive control processes.

The cognitive space can also represent different types of conflicts with low dimensionality, allowing for domain-general cognitive control as conflicts from different sources can be resolved using the same set of cognitive control processes. The researchers further hypothesized that the cognitive space representing different types of conflicts may be located in the frontoparietal network due to its essential roles in conflict resolution. Two solutions to resolving different conflict types were proposed, differing based on whether the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. The domain-general cognitive control theories posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can thus flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts. This is supported by the generalizable control adjustment.

Scientists have developed a new computer model, called the Hernandez-Hernandez model, to understand how smooth muscle cells in blood vessels regulate blood flow and blood pressure. These cells, found in the walls of systemic arteries and arterioles, play a crucial role in controlling the diameter of the vessels. The model is based on new experimental data showing sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from mice.

The model suggests that the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular calcium signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels are different in males and females. Although experimental data indicate that KV1.5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations suggest that the KV1.5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. In contrast, the model predicts that KV2.1 channels play a primary role in controlling membrane potential in female myocytes, which have larger KV2.1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation than male myocytes.

The model also shows that the gating of a small number of voltage-gated potassium channels and L-type calcium channels drives sex-specific differences in intracellular calcium and excitability over the physiological range of membrane potentials. Furthermore, the model predicts that female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used calcium channel blockers compared to male. This suggests that antihypertensive drugs may have different effects in males and females.

The Hernandez-Hernandez model is the first to integrate sex-specific variations in voltage-gated KV2.1 channels and predicts that KV2.1 channels play a critical role in controlling membrane potential in female myocytes. The model also predicts that clinically used antihypertensive calcium channel blockers cause larger reductions in calcium currents in female than in male arterial myocytes. Additionally, a one-dimensional vessel representation of electrotonically coupled arterial myocytes connected in series suggests that calcium channel blockers are more potent in females, resulting in a more substantial reduction in intracellular calcium in female arterial smooth muscle compared to male.

Overall, the Hernandez-Hernandez model provides a new framework for investigating the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs and highlights the importance of considering sex-specific differences in calcium and potassium channels in the development of new treatments for hypertension.

Summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a protein called CYRI-B as a potential mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with a poor prognosis, characterized by high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. The study found that CYRI-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumors in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of the Cyrib gene, which encodes the CYRI-B protein, accelerated tumor formation and increased the area of the pancreas showing lesions with high levels of phospho-ERK and phospho-JNK, two key downstream targets of KRAS and RAC1 that drive proliferation and expansion.

In the early stages of cancer development, CYRI-B appears to act as a buffer of RAC1 hyperactivation, preventing excessive cell growth and proliferation. However, as the disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis, the process by which cancer cells spread to other parts of the body. The study found that CYRI-B-depleted tumor cells showed reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1.

The researchers used a mouse model of metastatic PDAC to investigate the role of CYRI-B in pancreatic cancer. They found that CYRI-B localizes on macropinosomes in pancreatic cancer cell lines, suggesting a possible mechanism for how CYRI-B loss could affect tumor progression. Macropinosomes are vesicles that internalize nutrients and signaling receptors, and the study suggests that CYRI-B plays a role in regulating this process.

Overall, the study implicates CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into the pathways controlling metastasis. The findings suggest that CYRI-B may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PDAC, particularly in the early stages of the disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of CYRI-B in pancreatic cancer and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.
Scientists have identified a group of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) called HERV-K (HML-2) in rhesus macaques, a type of non-human primate. These viruses are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that have been integrated into the macaques' genome over time. The study found 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions that suggest recent or ongoing infectious activity in the animals.

Further analysis revealed that 106 of these proviruses form a clade characterized by a specific sequence between the env gene and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), which is derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K (HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM), but not great apes, indicating it originated after the ape/OWM split. Similar proviruses were also identified in white-cheeked gibbons, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons.

The study also found that the LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in the U3 region, which disrupts the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. However, the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating that the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

The researchers characterized a clade of HERV-K HML-2-related ERVs in rhesus macaques and other OWMs that include an ~750 bp non-coding region between env and the 3' LTR, derived from a recombination with a HERV-K11 HML-8 retrovirus. This characteristic indicates that SERV-K1 is a relatively young insertion, less than about 500,000 years old, and suggests that rhesus macaques may harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses.

The study's findings provide a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time and for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis. Previous studies have identified HML-2 proviruses in rhesus macaques, including one study that detected expression of env mRNA and identified an Env-specific immune response in a macaque. The current study's findings support the possibility that HML-2 viruses were recently or are currently active in rhesus macaques.
biomedical researchers investigated the role of Enterococcus faecalis in wound infections using a mouse model. They employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to analyze over 23, 000 cells from infected and uninfected wounds. The study aimed to elucidate the molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. The results revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, including dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes that contributed to an anti-inflammatory environment. The researchers found that E. faecalis infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes and modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution. Additionally, the study discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulated chemokine signaling pathways and promoted anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. The findings suggest that E. faecalis infection induces immunosuppression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, delaying the immune response. The study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the host response to persistent E. faecalis wound infection, offering new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections. The research highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with delayed healing and provides a foundation for future studies aimed at investigating bacterial factors contributing to wound pathogenesis. The study's findings have implications for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to combat wound infections and promote effective wound healing. Overall, the study provides a detailed understanding of the molecular changes associated with E. faecalis infection in wounds, shedding light on the complex interactions between bacteria, immune cells, and tissue cells during the wound healing process.
Scientists have long known that plants can communicate with each other through the release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) when attacked by herbivores. These VOCs can trigger defense responses in neighboring plants, but the timing and mechanisms of this process are not well understood. A recent study used a high-throughput mass spectrometry system to investigate the temporal dynamics of VOC transfer and response between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants.

The study found that continuous exposure to natural blends of VOCs from herbivore-attacked plants resulted in a predictable temporal response pattern in neighboring plants. Specifically, a burst of terpene release occurred at the onset of the second day of exposure, which was not due to terpene accumulation during the night, but rather coincided with delayed jasmonate accumulation in the receiver plants. This delayed burst occurred independently of day-night light transitions and could not be fully explained by the dynamics of VOC release from the sender plants.

Further experiments revealed that the delayed burst was the result of a stress memory from VOC exposure during the first day, combined with secondary exposure to bioactive VOCs on the second day. The study suggests that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced VOCs results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern.

The researchers propose several hypotheses to explain the ecological relevance of the clocked temporal kinetics of defense activation in neighboring plants. One possibility is that responding most strongly to VOC cues on the second day may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. The study also found that VOC-mediated priming on the first day yields a clocked response to VOCs perceived the next day.

To test this hypothesis, the researchers exposed receiver plants to VOCs from control plants or herbivory-induced plants for 1.25 hours, then disconnected them and exposed them to clean air for 17 hours. Half of the plants were then exposed to a secondary trigger, HAC, which showed the strongest correlation with all measured terpenes. The results suggest that the strong delayed volatile burst may be due to the interaction of an initial VOC burst that primes plants for higher VOC release at the onset of the second day, and a secondary trigger in the form of bioactive VOCs released from sender plants at the onset of the second day.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding the origins of human language and its unique properties, such as recursion. Recursion refers to the ability to place a vocal signal inside another of a similar kind, which is a fundamental aspect of human language and music. However, previous studies have found no evidence of recursive vocal patterns in nonhuman primates, suggesting that this ability may be exclusive to humans.

Recent research has discovered that wild flanged male orangutans exhibit a unique vocal behavior, where their long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences. This pattern is consistent with two hierarchical strata, where the lower stratum consists of three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms that are not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples. This suggests that the recursive structures in orangutan vocalizations are not the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures or anatomical artifacts, but rather a genuine example of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics.

This finding is significant because it represents a case of recursive vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music, which are typically associated with human language. The researchers propose that recursive vocal combinatorics may have first emerged as a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, which was later recruited and re-engineered for the generation of linguistic combinatorics.

The study's findings open up new avenues for research on the evolution of recursion in humans. Future studies could investigate recursive call sequence patterns in other orangutan vocal contexts and other great ape vocal behaviors to test the idea that recursive vocal combinatorics were first a feature of proto-musical expression. Additionally, a structural approach to analyzing primate vocal combinatorics, particularly in the wild, could provide insights into possible precursors and proto-states for the evolution of recursion within the hominid family. This approach may also reveal untapped signal diversity in nature and unrecognized combinatoric possibilities within the human clade.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ongoing battle between viruses and their hosts, which has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life's evolution. A key aspect of this arms race is the interaction between viral receptors and host cells, where viruses exploit cell surface proteins to initiate infection. In a recent study, researchers investigated the relationship between the MDA5 receptor and 5'ppp-RNA viruses in a lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy.

The study found that MDA5, a homolog of the RIG-I receptor, can substitute for RIG-I in recognizing 5'ppp-RNA viruses in vertebrates without RIG-I. This suggests that MDA5 has evolved alternative functions to detect viruses that were initially recognized by RIG-I. The researchers propose that this redundancy may have led to the loss of RIG-I from the species genome during evolution.

Furthermore, the study revealed that 5'ppp-RNA SCRV virus can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, promoting its own replication and immune evasion. This adversarial strategy highlights the complex arms race between virus replication and the innate immunity of its reservoir hosts in vertebrates.

The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrates and viruses, shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system. The research also offers a new perspective on the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates, which is a widespread event. The study's results suggest that MDA5 has evolved to compensate for the loss of RIG-I, providing a new understanding of the functional diversity of innate antiviral activity.

The study used a teleost fish, Miichthys miiuy, and a bird, Gallus gallus, both of which lack RIG-I, as well as two 5'ppp-RNA viruses, SCRV and VSV, to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5'ppp-RNA virus and host. The results demonstrated that the MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5'ppp-RNA viruses. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex relationship between viruses and their hosts, and highlight the importance of continued research into the evolution of the immune system.
The study investigated the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition in patients with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Twenty-nine consecutive patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. Body composition parameters, including fat body mass (FBM), lean body mass (LBM), and bone mineral density (BMD), were evaluated using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM, fat mass at arms, and fat mass at trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was also observed. The study found that FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition, particularly on FBM, suggesting that FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and guide clinicians in the evaluation of body composition in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT.

This study is an ancillary study of a prospective trial and is limited by its small sample size. However, the results suggest that FSH serum levels may be associated with changes in body composition in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. The study's findings are consistent with previous research showing that FSH levels are associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity in postmenopausal women. The study's results are hypothesis-generating and require further investigation to confirm the relationship between FSH and body composition in prostate cancer patients undergoing ADT. The study was partially funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals, which had no role in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SCD. Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels contribute to the pathophysiology of SCD. This study investigated the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition in failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD, and improves contractile function.

The study used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic heart failure (HF), including a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. The animals were randomized to receive dantrolene (DS) or placebo in early or chronic HF. The primary outcome was the incidence of VT/VF and SCD. The results showed that DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function.

The study found that inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD. The study highlights the importance of exploring new antiarrhythmic targets and developing new therapies for SCD.
Summary
     The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family, including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, plays a crucial role in regulating various biological processes through Smad transcription factors. In Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates body size through a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. This study aimed to identify direct target genes of Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri in C. elegans. Using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis, the researchers found that SMA-3/Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri have both overlapping and unique target genes. SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator at a genome-wide scale, while SMA-9/Schnurri targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppressed the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size regulation for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. The findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that regulate the secretion of extracellular components, such as collagen, into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation. The study also identified Smad-independent roles for SMA-9 in functions such as immunity, which is consistent with the pronounced role of vertebrate Schnurri homologs in immunity. Overall, this study provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of Smad and SMA-9/Schnurri in C. elegans and highlights the complexity of their interactions in regulating various biological processes.
Summary
     Cancer immune evasion is a major obstacle to the success of checkpoint immunotherapy in treating metastatic cancers. Recent research has identified the embryonic transcription factor DUX4 as a potential contributor to this phenomenon. DUX4 is a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation, and its expression has been found in a small subset of primary tumors. This study investigated the expression of DUX4 in metastatic tumors and its association with immune cell exclusion and response to PD-L1 blockade.

     The study found that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. In a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients, DUX4 expression was significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade. Furthermore, DUX4 expression was a significant predictor of survival, even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features. Patients with DUX4-expressing tumors had a median reduction in survival of over 1 year compared to those without DUX4 expression.

     The study also examined the correlation between DUX4 expression and PD-L1 levels in the tumor and immune compartments. DUX4 expression was found to be associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity, mirroring previous observations in primary cancers and cancer cell line models. The researchers hypothesized that DUX4 expression induces an immunosuppressive gene expression program, consistent with its established function in inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling in primary cancers.

     Urothelial cancers exhibited the highest frequency of DUX4 expression among the five metastatic cancer cohorts analyzed, suggesting that DUX4 may be particularly important in this tumor type. The study's findings demonstrate that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic cancers and is associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased response to PD-L1 blockade. These results motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.
Summary
     Livestock abortion is a significant disease syndrome affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. Despite its importance, there is a lack of data on the causes of livestock abortion, which hinders effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health. A surveillance platform was established in Tanzania to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. Between 2017 and 2019, 215 abortion events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated, with attribution achieved for 19.5% of cases. The study found that delays in obtaining samples significantly affected attribution, and histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through community-based field officers, practical sample collection, and molecular diagnostic platforms. The findings suggest that livestock abortion surveillance can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses, and identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study highlights the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for both syndromic and event-based surveillance, and demonstrates the potential for an effective reporting and investigation system to be operationalized across a range of settings in Tanzania, including remote rural areas. The study's results have implications for establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa. Non-infectious conditions, such as nutritional, metabolic, and toxic conditions, are also likely causes of livestock abortions in Tanzania, and recent stressful events, including drought and wild predator attacks, may play a role in unattributed abortion cases. The study's findings contribute to the limited information available on current practices, effectiveness, and challenges/opportunities of livestock abortion surveillance in low- and middle-income countries.
Summary
     Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC), the primary constituent of cigarette smoke, has been shown to increase the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. This effect is mediated through the activation of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and protein kinase C (PKC), leading to the induction of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs. Notably, this effect was not observed in Paneth cells.

     The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) abolished the effects of NIC on ISCs, suggesting that Notch signaling plays a crucial role in NIC-induced ISC proliferation. Furthermore, NIC was found to enhance in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after the loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, and DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. These findings indicate that NIC triggers a pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs, which may contribute to the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers.

     The study suggests that blocking the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling pathways may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers. Extrinsic factors, such as NIC, may increase the risk of cancer by promoting stem cell division. The data indicate that NIC increases the abundance and proliferation of ISCs, which may partly explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers.

     The study provides new insights into the pathway by which stem cells respond to NIC, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggests an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer. The findings validate that NIC affects ISCs rather than Paneth cells via Hippo-YAP/TAZ and Notch signaling activated through nAchRα7. The crosstalk between Hippo, Notch, and Wnt signaling regulates mammalian intestinal homeostasis, and the study highlights the potential therapeutic targets for treating NIC-induced colon cancer.
summary
     The Hsp70 chaperone system plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which are associated with stress, aging, and disease. Hsp70 solubilizes aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones, including J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). This study investigated the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes on Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing.

     The results show that Hsp110 plays a major role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining the final efficacy of the process. Hsp110 catalyzes the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto the aggregate surface, modifying aggregates into smaller species that are more readily processed by chaperones. The stimulation of Hsp70 by Hsp110 is stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif.

     Furthermore, the study demonstrates for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. This destabilization of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface may improve disaggregation but also lead to inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. The balanced interplay between co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.

     The study also found that the substrate-binding activity specific to Hsp110 is not necessary to increase the Sis1-Ssa1 binding to aggregates, and the effective NEF concentration is negatively correlated with its affinity for Hsp70. The results suggest that Hsp110-dependent stimulation of disaggregation is limited to its initial stages, including chaperone recruitment to aggregates and their disassembly, but not final protein folding.

     The initial Hsp110-dependent loading of more Hsp70 onto aggregates correlates with their remodelling into smaller aggregated species, which improves their recognition by the Hsp104 disaggregase. Hsp110 may cause the release of Hsp70 from an aggregate, as well as of a JDP, unless it remains tethered via another interaction. The fate of the displaced proteins is yet to be established. The positive effect of the Hsp110 NEF on protein recovery from aggregates is substantially more pronounced when the Hsp70 chaperone system comprises a class B JDP. Theoretically, the stimulation by Sse1 might occur at one or many stages of protein disaggregation, starting from the association of the Hsp70 system with an aggregate surface, through polypeptide disentanglement, to the final folding of the released substrate.

     Biomedical researchers have developed a low-cost wearable digital insole to analyze gait patterns in individuals with musculoskeletal conditions such as knee arthropathy. Traditional gait analysis in clinical settings relies on subjective visual observation due to the high cost and complexity of equipment required for objective analysis. The new digital insole uses machine learning algorithms to analyze force plate data collected from participants with knee arthropathy and controls. The results show that the digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements, with an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (auROC) of 0.86 and area under the precision-recall curve (auPR) of 0.90. The study also demonstrated that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data can accurately identify individuals using digital insoles based on their gait characteristics.

     The researchers trained a support vector machine (SVM) model on force plate data to predict disease status and found that it performed well on both the training and test sets. The model was then applied to a separate, independent dataset derived from digital insole studies on individuals with knee osteoarthritis and controls, achieving an auROC of 0.83 and auPR of 0.86. This suggests that the digital insole can measure vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) similarly to a force plate.

     The study highlights the potential of wearable digital insoles as a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods. The low cost and ease of use of digital insoles make them an attractive option for at-home gait assessments, which could improve the frequency and depth of patient monitoring. The researchers also developed a novel machine learning framework for application within digital insoles to detect knee arthropathy status and identified disease-specific gait patterns in knee arthroscopy. The study provides a framework for the clinical development of at-home gait assessments using wearable technology, which could improve the diagnosis and monitoring of musculoskeletal conditions such as knee arthropathy.
Researchers have been searching for alternative treatments to opioids for managing post-surgical pain due to their severe side effects and risk of accidental death. A recent study investigated the potential of a human amniotic membrane ( AM ) product called Clarix Flo ( FLO ) as a non-opioid therapy for post-surgical pain. The study found that local application of FLO attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity in mice without causing the known side effects of opioid use. This effect was achieved through the direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways.

     The researchers further purified the major matrix component of FLO, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ), which has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. They found that HC-HA/PTX3 replicated the pain-inhibiting effects of FLO on DRG neurons. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3 induced cytoskeleton rearrangements that inhibited sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief.

     The study used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO. Since HC-HA/PTX3 mimics FLO in its ability to inhibit pain behavior and has higher purity and greater water solubility compared to FLO, it is well-suited for investigating cellular mechanisms. The findings suggest that HC-HA/PTX3 may attenuate the activation of key receptors involved in pain control such as TRPV1, TRPA1, and MrgprD. Additionally, it fundamentally decreases nociceptor excitability by inducing membrane hyperpolarization and altering intrinsic membrane properties.

     Overall, the study highlights the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. The identification of HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition provides new insights into the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. These findings have significant implications for the development of novel non-opioid treatments for post-surgical pain.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the color intensity of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and their functional characteristics. RPE cells, derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPE), were analyzed for their color intensity and gene expression profiles at the single-cell level using an Automated Live Imaging and Cell Picking System (ALPS). The study found that the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells did not correlate with specific gene expression profiles, suggesting that the color of RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functional characteristics.

The researchers used ALPS to photograph each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. They categorized the iPSC-RPE cells into four clusters based on gene expression, but found no correlation between the color intensity of the cells and their gene expression profiles. This led the researchers to hypothesize that the color of RPE cells may be a temporary condition that does not strongly indicate their functional characteristics.

Further analysis of the transcriptome of the iPSC-RPE cells revealed that the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, and there is a time-lag between mRNA expression, production of enzymes, and synthesis of melanin. The researchers also found that gene sets related to retinoid recycling, an important feature of RPE cells, showed weak correlation with the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells.

Previous studies have suggested that in vitro pigmentation of stem cell-derived RPE cells may not necessarily reflect their levels of functional maturation. For example, bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted, and iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented when prepared become heavily pigmented after engraftment. These findings support the idea that the color of RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functional characteristics, and that other factors, such as retinoid recycling, may play a more important role in determining the functional maturity of RPE cells.
Researchers have developed a novel behavioral apparatus called the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MarmoAAP) to study cooperative behaviors in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). This apparatus addresses the limitations of traditional research methods, which often fail to capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. MarmoAAP enables high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting.

The MarmoAAP apparatus is designed to accommodate a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities, making it a versatile tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. It also provides a platform to perform investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. The combination of a highly modular and adaptable design, high-resolution behavioral data, and integration with neural recordings positions MarmoAAP as a robust and versatile tool for unraveling the complexities of primate behavior.

The researchers aimed to develop a task that captures the nuances of cooperative behaviors and allows for high-resolution data collection, making it more suitable for investigating the underlying neural mechanisms in primates. They introduced an innovative method for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets using an automated apparatus and task. The MarmoAAP apparatus and associated behavioral paradigms create an avenue for simultaneous neural recordings while freely moving marmosets are engaged in tasks implemented by MarmoAAP.

MarmoAAP significantly increases the number of trials available for analysis, ensuring ample statistical power when investigating the relationship between neural activity and behaviors. By incorporating behavioral metrics from video and audio recordings with the timing of marmosets' pulling behaviors and reward delivery, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between behavior, vocal communication, and cooperative interactions in this species. The MarmoAAP apparatus and associated automated cooperative pulling paradigm are expected to make a significant contribution to the study of marmoset social behaviors in the field, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations.
Biomedical researchers investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the developing offspring using a physiologically relevant murine model. They found that early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential, indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation.

The study replicated regions identified as sensitive to gestational alcohol exposure in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). The researchers employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to assess CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver, two target organs affected by ethanol. They also conducted candidate gene testing of regions identified in prior studies as sensitive to early moderate PAE.

The exposure period covered the equivalent of pre-conception up until the first trimester in humans, reflecting a typical situation in which women may consume alcohol up until pregnancy recognition. The primary outcome of the study was differences in offspring DNA methylation, and secondary outcomes of behavioral deficits across neurodevelopmental domains relevant to FASD were also examined.

In a validation study, DNA methylation array data from 147 newborn buccal swabs from the Asking Questions About Alcohol in Pregnancy (AQUA) cohort were analyzed. The results showed no evidence of differential DNA methylation at specific CpG sites corresponding to mouse differentially methylated regions (DMRs). However, in the murine model, alcohol effects on DNA methylation were predominantly tissue-specific, with only two genomic regions and four genes that were similarly affected in both liver and brain.

A maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. The study demonstrates that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlights a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions. The findings suggest that early moderate PAE can have long-lasting effects on genome regulation, which may contribute to the development of FASD.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long considered all genes to be equivalent targets for RNA interference (RNAi), a process in which double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is used to silence gene expression. However, recent studies have shown that the loss of certain regulators of RNAi in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. To investigate this phenomenon, scientists have identified an intersecting network of regulators that act on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. This network includes the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3.

     The researchers found that any two of these proteins are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene. Notably, the requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Using quantitative models and simulations, the scientists discovered that changing the cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, and that animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells. Additionally, they found that cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within 'pUG zones' matching the dsRNA.

     The study used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to the efficacy and resistance of RNAi. The researchers characterized the skeletal pathway required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA and found that the requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA. A dynamic model of RNA changes during silencing by dsRNA revealed several criteria for efficient RNA silencing.

     The study suggests that similar mechanisms could be used to generate other 22G RNAs that are independent of RDE-10, and that future studies are needed to test each aspect of the model. The findings have implications for the use of RNAi as a tool for gene silencing in plants, insects, and humans, and highlight the importance of considering gene-specific factors in the functional outcome of RNAi.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the underlying mechanisms of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) and identify potential predictors of mortality. They analyzed whole-blood RNA sequencing data from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. The study aimed to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM severity and mortality, and to determine the best predictors of death.

Using weighted gene co-expression network analysis, the researchers identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality. A consensus analysis revealed distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. The study found that increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization.

The researchers employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, followed by logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose the best predictors. Four hub genes – MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4 – were identified as strong TBM mortality predictors. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death.

The study also identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status. In HIV-negative TBM, the candidate predictors consisted of the combination of common hub genes, HIV-negative specific hub genes, and clinical biomarkers such as age, TBM severity, and CSF lymphocyte count. The researchers selected potential gene predictors from 26 common and 10 HIV-specific hub genes, which represented the dominant modules associated with mortality.

Transcriptional profiles associated with TBM mortality stratified by HIV status showed that in HIV-negative individuals, 786 genes were differentially expressed, whereas in HIV-positive individuals, 1620 genes were differentially expressed. The study suggests that host transcriptional signatures associated with TBM mortality differ according to HIV status. The findings provide insights for potential therapeutic targets and a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes in TBM.
Summary
     Antibodies are essential tools in biomedical research for detecting and characterizing proteins. However, many commercial antibodies fail to recognize their intended targets, making it difficult to assess the feasibility of having a potent and specific antibody for each protein in the human proteome. To address this issue, researchers developed a standardized approach to characterize 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 neuroscience-related proteins using parental and knockout cell lines. The study found that more than 50% of the antibodies failed in one or more applications, but around 50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, suggesting significant coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The study also identified hundreds of underperforming antibodies used in published articles, highlighting the need for manufacturers to reassess and improve their products. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were revised or removed from the market. The study provides an efficient strategy for achieving coverage of the human proteome by mining the existing commercial antibody repertoire and using the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts. The researchers developed optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence applications and tested 614 commercially available antibodies against 65 human proteins. The results suggest that approximately two-thirds of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody. The study provides an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for representing and comparing antibody performance, estimating the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies, and assessing the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods. The raw data are openly available for further analysis and validation. The study aims to contribute to a comprehensive and standardized ecosystem for validating commercial antibodies.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have a growing need to independently control gene expression in multiple tissues within the same animal, particularly in the context of inter-organ communication studies. To address this need, scientists have developed technologies that combine the GAL4/UAS system with a second binary expression system, such as the LexA system or QF system. A new resource has been created to facilitate the combined use of these systems in various Drosophila tissues.

     The resource includes a set of over 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions generated by CRISPR knock-in, which have been verified for tissue specificity in larvae. Additionally, constructs have been built that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. These constructs can be integrated into the fly genome, allowing for the isolation of fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD using FLP/FRT recombination.

     The researchers have also evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of shRNA fly lines as a community resource. This library will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.

     To generate the LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions, the researchers used CRISPR-based HDR to clone T2A-LexA-GAD, T2A-QF, or T2A-LexA-GAD-T2A-QF fragments into a donor plasmid. They selected genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns and tissue specificity, including genes that induce expression of fluorescent reporter genes and molecular genetic reagents such as shRNAs for RNAi.

     The resulting stocks, vectors, and protocols will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously, making it easier to study inter-organ communication and other complex biological processes. This resource will provide a valuable tool for the scientific community, enabling researchers to explore new areas of research and gain a deeper understanding of biological systems.

     The transcription factor Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is essential for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Recent studies have shown that Bcl11b regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses through the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2. C1ql2 directly interacts with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 (25b+), to exert its functions. Disruption of the C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+) interaction by expressing a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or deleting Nrxn3 in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b and C1ql2 mutant phenotypes. This study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. The findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.

     Bcl11b is a zinc finger transcription factor involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Bcl11b is essential for synapse function in the mossy fiber circuit of the adult murine hippocampus. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms downstream of Bcl11b remained elusive. Bcl11b plays a crucial role in the development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and hippocampal learning and memory. In the mature hippocampus, Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber synapses.

     This study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of mossy fiber synapse function. Recent genetic studies suggested that single components of this pathway are associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. The study demonstrates that these molecules are interconnected in one regulatory pathway. Conditional ablation of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus leads to structural and functional changes of mossy fiber synapses, characterized by an overall reduction in synapse numbers, loss of bouton complexity, misdistribution of synaptic vesicles, and loss of long-term potentiation. Reintroduction of the synaptic organizer protein C1ql2, which is a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b and is downregulated in Bcl11b mutant dentate gyrus granule neurons, rescues the structural and functional changes of mossy fiber synapses. The study identifies a Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3-dependent signaling pathway in the control of basic structural and functional properties of mossy fiber synapses. Analysis of this regulatory pathway in mice may provide important novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Summary
     The study investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein Sfp1 in regulating gene expression in yeast. Sfp1 is known to control the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation. The researchers found that Sfp1 can regulate transcription by binding to promoters, similar to other transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions of genes, known as gene bodies. They discovered that after binding to promoters, Sfp1 interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and affects its configuration, leading to dissociation or conformational change of the Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. Backtracking is a process where Pol II pauses or reverses direction during transcription.

     The study also found that Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs during transcription and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and these mRNAs is controlled by their promoters and coincides with Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin. The researchers observed that Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin correlates with the extent of backtracked Pol II. They propose that Sfp1 accompanies Pol II after promoter recruitment and regulates backtracking, which in turn allows Sfp1 to relocate to the nascent transcripts and regulate their stability.

     The study suggests that Sfp1's co-transcriptional binding imprints the fate of mRNAs, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between transcription and mRNA decay. The researchers also found that Sfp1's two modes of transcription regulation are connected, with its effect on transcription elongation linked to its function on mRNA stabilization. The study provides evidence that Sfp1's binding to gene bodies and Pol II occupancy are correlated, and that Sfp1's function extends beyond transcription initiation to encompass transcription elongation.

     The study's findings indicate that Sfp1's interaction with chromatin affects both Pol II elongation and mRNA half-lives, suggesting a mechanistic linkage. The researchers also found that backtracking is associated with co-transcriptional binding of Sfp1 to nascent RNA, and that Sfp1 binds a subpopulation of mRNAs whose transcription is stimulated by Sfp1. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of Sfp1 in regulating gene expression and highlights the complex interplay between transcription and mRNA stability.
Summary
     Researchers investigated the connection between programmed cell death (PCD) during plant development and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. They focused on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. Mutations in both dPCD regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants also exhibited hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This suggests that root cap PCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root.

    Reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells. This indicates a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots. The study proposes that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. S. indica was found to downregulate BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation.

    Transcriptome analysis showed no significant changes in SMB expression during fungal colonization, but a significant decrease in BFN1 expression was observed after 6 days post-inoculation (dpi) in Arabidopsis colonized by S. indica. Reporter lines showed a reduction in BFN1 promoter activity in epidermal cells in contact with the fungus compared to mock-treated roots. BFN1 expression and nuclear localization in the root cap or xylem were not affected by S. indica.

    The study suggests that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization. Impaired dPCD in the Arabidopsis smb-3 and bfn1-1 mutants increased colonization by the beneficial endophyte S. indica. The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolonization along the entire primary root, indicating that the extra sheet of cell corpses surrounding smb-3 roots provide additional and easily accessible nutrients that fuel fungal colonization. While dPCD protects the meristem from microbial colonization, the study proposes that some adapted microbes manipulate host dPCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of BFN1 to facilitate accommodation in the root. Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins, fungal-derived signaling molecules or a systemic response of Arabidopsis roots underlies BFN1 downregulation by S. indica remains to be investigated.
summary
     Biomedical research has identified large vesicle extrusion from neurons, known as exophers, as a potential mechanism contributing to neurodegenerative diseases. Exophers can spread pathogenic protein aggregates and promote inflammatory responses. However, the factors regulating exopher extrusion are not well understood. This study investigated the role of mechanical force in exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a nematode worm commonly used in scientific research.

     The study found that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteostressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production.

     The study also found that genetic interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths, while genetic interventions that suppress ALMR exopher production are associated with shorter uterus lengths. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, suggesting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus.

     The study concludes that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. The findings draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
biomedical research article summary
     Deficient Wnt signaling has been implicated in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and recent studies suggest that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) may play a role in the disease. This study investigated the contribution of DKK3 to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. The results show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD patients and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages of the disease. In mouse models of AD, extracellular DKK3 levels are increased, and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around amyloid plaques.

     The study found that DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway and a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, knocking down DKK3 in mouse models of AD restores synapse number and memory. The results suggest that DKK3 is a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD.

     Further investigation revealed that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways. Knocking down DKK3 in mouse models of AD ameliorated the changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus, both before and after plaque deposition. The study also found that DKK3 affects synapse number around amyloid plaques in mouse models of AD, supporting the hypothesis that DKK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this disease.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms that contribute to synapse vulnerability in AD. Synapse loss is a strong correlate of cognitive impairment in AD, and the mechanisms that trigger synaptic changes remain poorly understood. This study sheds light on the role of DKK3 in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. The results suggest that DKK3 is a key driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD, and that knocking down DKK3 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating the disease.

     The global rise of antibiotic resistance has led to a pressing need for new drugs against bacterial pathogens. Researchers have turned to natural compounds used by microbes to inhibit competitors as a potential solution. A recent study investigated the antibacterial properties of pyoverdines, iron-chelating compounds produced by environmental Pseudomonas species. The study found that pyoverdines have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens.

     A screen of 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens revealed several pyoverdines with high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Furthermore, pyoverdine increased the survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes.

     Experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. The study suggests that pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens. The researchers propose that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas species could be potent agents to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition.

     To test this hypothesis, the researchers screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains isolated from soil and freshwater habitats for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, the researchers elucidated the chemical structure to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition. The study found that pyoverdines have a high affinity for iron and can induce iron starvation and growth arrest in human pathogens.

     The researchers applied the concept of siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities to human opportunistic pathogens. They investigated whether siderophores from non-pathogenic environmental bacteria can induce iron starvation and growth arrest in human pathogens. The study demonstrated that pyoverdines exhibit antibacterial activity in hosts and have low toxicity at effective concentrations. The results suggest that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas species have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens.
Summary
     Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder characterized by a failure of prefrontal networks, but the exact mechanisms underlying this failure are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have shown that disruptions in synaptic function contribute to this failure, but the link between synaptic disruptions and network-level failures remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits to investigate the relationship between N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) synaptic function and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia.

The model revealed that the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influences oscillatory spike synchrony. Specifically, reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, such as those that occur during behavior. This finding is consistent with dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this synchrony by administration of NMDAR antagonists.

The study provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. The results establish a theoretical basis and circuit mechanism for how reduction of NMDAR synaptic function implicated in schizophrenia could lead to the desynchronization of neural activity in prefrontal recurrent circuits. The model also shows that spiking networks situated close to a boundary in the synaptic parameter space separating asynchronous and synchronous activity states can explain a variety of biological observations, including the emergence of 0-lag synchronous spiking between individual prefrontal neurons and the failure of synchronous spiking to emerge between prefrontal neurons when NMDAR synaptic currents are reduced.

This study builds on previous modeling studies that have addressed the relationship between NMDAR function and oscillatory activity in prefrontal networks, but did not address the specific topic of how slow NMDAR recurrent excitation and external input jointly influence spike timing dynamics at the neuron level and oscillatory dynamics at the population level. The findings of this study provide new insights into the circuit mechanisms responsible for the link between NMDAR synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics in schizophrenia.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have investigated the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, typically in low-oxygen environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis involve the differentiation of endothelial cells into two distinct cell types: Tip and Stalk cells. This process is controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication. However, the dynamics of spatial patterning of cell fate specification during angiogenesis are not yet fully understood.

     Using a controlled experimental model of angiogenesis combined with mathematical and computational analyses, the researchers found that the regular spatial patterning of Tip and Stalk cells can undergo an order-disorder transition at a relatively high input level of the pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. This transition results in robust but temporally unstable cell differentiation, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. The researchers also found that sprouts form in a manner that maximizes their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin.

     The study suggests that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation that enables but does not instruct subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. The researchers propose a dynamic view of angiogenic induction, where VEGF input can induce NOTCH signaling and the formation of Tip cells that can behave as mini-sprouts. However, the inputs specifying cell fate can be contradictory, leading to complex dynamic outcomes that are still poorly understood.

     The researchers used a mathematical model to simulate the angiogenesis process and calibrated the model's parameters to match the experimentally observed Tip/Stalk fractions at a VEGF input of 100 ng/ml. They also quantified the spatial patterning characteristics of the inferred positions of Tip cells in the experimental angiogenesis model. The study highlights the need for more refined models that explicitly integrate the interconnections between biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-Stalk fate. The findings of this study can contribute to a better understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes.
biomedical summary
     The locus coeruleus (LC) is a brain region that plays a critical role in learning and memory, particularly in the hippocampus. Recent studies have suggested that the LC may release dopamine, in addition to norepinephrine, into the hippocampus, which could be important for memory formation. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and the specific role of dopamine and norepinephrine in memory formation are not well understood.

     In this study, researchers investigated the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. They found that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. The researchers also demonstrated that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus, and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity.

     Importantly, the study showed that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not. This suggests that dopamine release from the LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory formation than norepinephrine. The researchers propose that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning.

     The study provides new insights into the role of the LC-hippocampus interaction in learning and memory, and highlights the importance of dopamine in memory formation. The findings have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory, and could potentially inform the development of new treatments for memory-related disorders. The study's use of optogenetic stimulation to enhance long-term memory formation also suggests a potential therapeutic approach for improving memory function.

     Overall, the study demonstrates the critical role of the LC-hippocampus interaction in learning and memory, and provides new evidence for the importance of dopamine in memory formation. The findings have significant implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying learning and memory, and could potentially lead to the development of new treatments for memory-related disorders.
