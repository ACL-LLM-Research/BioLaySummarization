In Caenorhabditis elegans, the process of cell reprogramming, where germ cells are converted into somatic cells, requires chromatin perturbation. Researchers have discovered that the GL-1/Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in this process, contrary to its known function in maintaining undifferentiated germ stem cells. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcript analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, they found that GL-1/Not promotes reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GL-1/Not target facilitating reprogramming. This finding has implications for development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

GL-1/Notch signaling is essential for maintaining a pool of undifferentiated stem cells in the C. elegans germ. However, researchers found an unexpected role of GL-1/Not in promoting cell reprogramming. To understand this phenomenon, they identified genes activated upon increased GL-1/Not signaling and found a possible antagonistic relationship between GL-1/Not and PR2. The C. elegans PR2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6, and levels of corresponding transcripts were not altered by GL-1/Not signaling. Analyzing genes with higher baseline germ expression, the disproportionate linkage of Not-activated was striking. In C. elegans, genes are largely silenced by C. elegans PR2.

Researchers identified regulated by GL-1/Not, including genes maintaining germ stem cells. Unexpectedly, many activated by GL-1/Not were also repressed by cell-stabilizing chromatin PR2. They show GL-1/Not and PR2 have antagonistic effect on cell-fate decisions and co-regulation of common, ut-1.
A study investigated the role of the adaptor protein SK2 (SK2) in defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia) infection in mice. K. pneumonia is a significant pathogen that causes respiratory, blood, and bladder infections. The study found that SK2- mice had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice, which was controlled by SK2 expression in innate immune cells. SK2- neutrophils and monocytes were present in lungs and neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K. pneumonia infection, but K pneumonia-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was abolished in vitro. K. pneumonia-induced neutil ROS required the activity of Src family kinases (SFK), Syk, B, PLC2, and PK. The loss of SK2 significantly hindered K pneumonia-induced phosphorylation of FK, Sy, and Py2, implicating SK2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen signaling pathways. SK2 signaling in neutils was essential for K pneumonia-activated ROS production and promoting bacterial clearance during infection.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the role of the hypnoite reservoir in Plasmod vivax transmission. The model accounts for the activation and death of hypnoites in the liver, which cause relapse infections weeks to months after initial infection. The model is validated with data from tropical strains of P vivax and embedded in a P viv transmission model to demonstrate the build-up and depletion of the hypite reservoir. Results show that the reservoir is dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypites and some having heavily infected livers. Those with more hypites are predicted to experience relapse and contribute to P viv transmission. Incorporating hypite-killing drugs like primaquine into treatment regimens is predicted to reduce viv transmission, as those with most hypites are likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.
Selective logging in Amazonian forests results in the emission of over 90g of carbon (C) per hectare per year, which is then balanced by forest regrowth. A study of 133 permanent plots across Amazonia reveals regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass affect post-logging carbon recovery. Above-ground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield (21±3 Mg ha-1) than in the south (12±3 Mg ha-1) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). Survivors play a key role in regrowth and a comprehensive map of post-disturbance recovery in Amazonia is provided.

The study partitions post-disturbance carbon gain from growth and loss of trees ≥20 cm DBH and elaborates drivers of recovery in forests by selective logging across Amazon. Long-term data from 13 experimentally-disturbed sites in the Amazon and Guiana are used. Sites meet criteria: located in tropical forests with annual precipitation above 1000mm, total area above 1ha, at least one pre- and at least two post-cens. Selective logging is studied due to economic implications for management and data from the TFO network are unique in duration and extent.

Results are up-scaled to Amazon using maps of climate, conditions, and soil density and predictive maps of changes over 10 years under 40% loss, a common intensity after logging in Amazon. Climate change draws attention to human impacts on carbon cycles and 2.1±1 Pg yr-1 loss by various disturbances in tropical forests. Selective logging causes 2.1±1 Pg yr-1 loss.
Researchers have identified two distinct populations of stem cells in the adult mouse brain's lateral ventricular subzone (SVZ): neuro-initiating cells (NICs) and quiescent stem cells (pre-PC). NICs are characterized by high expression of Glast, EGFR, and Plexin2, and are mitotically active and short-lived, forming neurospheres that undergo multilineage differentiation. In contrast, pre-PCs are quiescent, express higher levels of Glast, and lower EGFR and Plex2, and cannot form neuropheres but express stem cell markers and are long-lived in the SVZ. NICs are depleted by temozomide, while pre-PCs survive and repopulate the SV. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 polycomb protein depletes both NIC and pre-PC, with pre-PC more dependent on B-1 for Cnka (16ink4) repression. The study distinguishes quies NSCs from NIC, enabling their study in vivo.
Researchers have investigated the function of Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues, using cryo-electron microscopy and cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that Pie1 has a bowl-shaped structure capable of inducing membrane curvature, suggesting that Pie1 channels may interact and influence each other's distribution and function. The study examined Pie1 channels at endogenously low and overexpressed at high levels, and used stochastic simulations of Pie1 distributions to show that both endogenous (1-2 channels/μm2) and non-physiological (10-100/100/μm) densities cause substantial overlap. The results indicate that Pie1 density has no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension, suggesting that Pie channels at physiologically relevant densities inherently behave as mechanotrans. This property enables cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire membrane.
Researchers investigated the effect of volatility on decision-making in perception by introducing a novel manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex in macaque monkeys and humans. The study aimed to test predictions of the bounded accumulation model, which suggests that an increase in noise leads to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically higher confidence. The manipulation was applied to a well-studied motion task and verified by recording from neurons in the macaque's visual cortex, specifically in areas MT and MST, known to represent momentary evidence in tasks. 

The study found that increasing the variance of momentary evidence, or volatility, increased decision speed and confidence across a range of stimuli with minimal accuracy impairment. The magnitude of effects agreed with predictions of the bounded accumulation model. To test the influence of volatility on decision-making, the study required independent control over signal and noise in evidence, which was achieved by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus. The manipulation was verified by recording from direction-selective neurons in the macaque's MT and MST areas, known to represent momentary evidence in tasks. 

The relationship between volatility and decision speed was studied using a reaction-time version of the random motion discrimination task. Three human participants completed 663 trials, and one macaque completed 1,137. Each trial started with fixation on a central spot for 0.5s, followed by two targets. The study used the manipulation to test the influence of noise on choice, reaction time, and confidence in monkeys and humans.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the insulin-like signaling pathway maintains a relatively short lifespan by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of mammalian FOXO transcription factors. Calcineurin (PP2 phosphatase) also limits lifespan, but its mechanism is unknown. This study shows that Caenorhabditis calcinein TAX-6B1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMII) ortholog UNC-43 regulate lifespan through DAF-16. UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates D-16, promoting its nuclear localization, while TAX-6B1 dephosphylates D-16, leading to inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMII and calcineurin. Direct targets of worm calcine have not been identified, but this study found D-16 is phosphorylated and activated by UNC-43 at serine 286, phosphoryl group removed by TAX-6B. UNC-43 and TAX-6B regulate lifespan through reversible phosphorylation of D-16. Data suggest CAMII (UNC) and calcine (TAX-6B) extend or shorten lifespan by phosphorylating or dephosphylating serine of D-16. The antagonistic nature of these enzymes raises possibility that opposing effects on D- and common signal (Ca/CAM) UNC and TAX-6 would negate each other and have no control D- In cases, nuclear induced by UNC or TAX was diminished by D- RNA. Insulin signaling overpowers CAMII and calcine in regulation of D- localization.
Researchers have investigated how fruit flies groom their bodies using sequential movements, a process that remains poorly understood in the nervous system. They found that distinct motor programs for cleaning individual body parts are organized in a hierarchy, with earlier programs suppressing later ones, allowing the sequence to progress. By activating specific neural subsets, they controlled each motor program and showed that suppression mediates sequential selection. A computational model replicating independently evoked movements in parallel, but selected serially through suppression, reproduced the grooming sequence. This is the first example of an innate sequence implemented by a hierarchical model for generating actions.

The study demonstrated that dust on the body elicits different motor programs for five parts progressing in series. By targeting subsets, they gained control over each program, showing they are organized in a hierarchy. An empirically derived model demonstrated how suppression mediates the selection of programs. The ability to select behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided infrastructure for sequential actions (Houng and Hart, 1995). Activation and parallel models describe mechanisms generating sequential behavior (Flood et al,201;2013). These have invigorated interest in neurons driving behavior, but also enable probing organization through specific actions. This study the principles underlying control in an innate behavior common to most animals-grooming (Sachs,198). Animals have mechanisms for selecting favorable and suppressing different programs. A finding is that hierarchical among behaviors leads to sequence emergence. Identifying circuit for each module and how interact will reveal organization in the system through suppression.
Researchers have identified a protein called Shugoshin-like 2 (Sol) that plays a crucial role in coordinating essential processes during meiosis I in mammalian oocytes. Meiosis is a complex process of cell division that requires accurate chromosome segregation, which depends on coordination between cohesion, kinetochore-microtub interactions (K-fib), and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Sol, in addition to protecting cohesin, turns off the SAC, promotes congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis spind, facilitates Kib formation, and limits bivalent stretching. Its ability to protect cohes depends on interaction with PP2, silencing SAC is mediated by direct binding to Mad2. Sol's effect on bivalent and Kiber formation is independent of PP2, mediated by recruitment of MCA and inhibition of Aurora kinase activity. Sol's multiple interactions link many processes for faithful chromosome segregation.

Sol helps turn off SAC by binding PP2 and MCC protein Mad2, moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting kinetokines MCA, and promotes Kiber formation by downregulating Aurora/C activity. Meiotic segregation is highly dependent on various biochemical processes. Depletion of Sol in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences during me I, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in kinetochore-microtule attachments. Sol silences SAC by binding Mad using similar MIM to Mad's partners Cdc20 and Mad1. Delayed biorientation of bival on meind, increased bivalent, and Aurora/C activity at kinetores, accompanied by increase in lateral and decrease in kinetochore-microtules. Sol deficiency delayed APC/CC20 activation, required to shut SAC.

A single protein regulates chromatid cohesion, chromosome, spindle checkpoint, and Aurora/Cases. Different mutations alter regulation but not processes, proving pleiotropy in SolΔ oocytes not due to secondary or tertiary effects. Sol defective PP2 binding fails to protect centrom cohes, like S1 in yeast. Sol deficiency causes changes chromosome and microtule dynamics.
Neuron-wide RNA transport combines with netrin-mediated local translation to spatially regulate the synaptic proteome. Research has shown that experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity require localized RNA and protein synthesis, with local translation playing a role in altering synapse structure and function during formation and plasticity. This study investigates whether local stimulation also triggers RNA transport from the nucleus to synapses. Imaging in cultured Aplyia sensory-motor neurons, RNAs were found throughout the neuron arbor, but translation was enriched at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. Investigation of mechanisms revealed a role for calcium-dependent netrin-1/DCC signaling in regulating local translation. Spatially restricting gene expression by regulating translation rather than delivering RNAs to synapses maximizes the neuronal ar's readiness to respond to local cues.

The study found that, in addition to regulating translation, stimulation controls RNA trafficking from the nucleus to subcellular sites, consistent with previous reports of activity regulating mRNA localization in neurons. A trans-synaptic signal promoting localized translation was suggested, with a role for netrin-1/DCC in local translation at synapses. RNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the SN to synaptic and non-syn sites, but translation was enriched at sites of contact and stimulation. Results indicate spatial regulation in Aplyia sensory neurons is primarily at translation rather than RNA targeting the nucleus. Measures demonstrated localized translation at synapses and stimulated synapses.

Netrin-1 release from SN or MN during synapse formation and plasticity triggers translation at synaptic but not non-syn contacts. Recombinant F-netrin-1 was incubated with Aplyia sensoryotor cultures to test netrin regulation of localized transcripts.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the formation of complex patterns in multicellular structures using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type emergence and cannot selectively perturb specific subpopulations. The study employed an inducible CRISPR system in iPSC to silence proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension, ROCK1 and CDH1. Mosaic knockdown of ROCK or CDH resulted in differential patterning within iPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, retaining epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown stimulated a transient wave of gene expression within mixed populations that stabilized with self-organization. Mosaic patterning enables interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating understanding molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis.

The study used an inducible CRPR system in iPSC to silence proteins that regulate adhesion and cortical tension. Genetically controlled symmetry events within iP populations by creating mixed populations with and without CRPR system then induced knockdown. Knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH parallels induction pattering via adhesion. This study explored mechanical manipulation of iPSC subpopulations results in controllable selforganization into repeat patterns. However, methods cannot selectively discriminate cells or address emergence heterotyp interactions multic organization. CRPR within subpopulations provides avenues to control emergence asymmetric phenotypes and multicellular patterns. Mosaic KD interrogated creation physical asymmetries in homogeneous leads multicellular pattern formation. Induction of KD ROCK or CD1 results 'bottom' cell formation iP colonies preserving pluripency.
Researchers have proposed a normative theory to explain why the precision of visual working memory decreases with the number of items encoded. The theory suggests that the brain minimizes the sum of an error-based cost and neural cost associated with encoding. A model based on this theory was constructed and found to predict size effects, which are mediated by probability, aligning with previous findings. The model also accounts for effects of size and probability on precision in delayed-estimation experiments. Additionally, it was found that the amount of resource invested can vary non-monotonically with size. The theory suggests it is sometimes optimal to encode a subset or none of relevant items in a task. This raises the possibility that cognitive limitations arise from cost minimization rather than constraints.

 The theory may apply beyond working memory tasks, as it has been speculated that attention selectivity arises from balancing performance against spiking costs. It provides a formalism to test this speculation and explains size effects in attention tasks. The model was tested on data from nine delayed-est experiments and accounts for effects of size and probability with few parameters. It also accounts for nonotonicity between size and total resource invested in encoding. The model predicts a nonotonic relation between population spiking and size at the neural level. This can be tested using neuroimaging experiments. The study focused on size and probability effects on encoding, but the theory also makes predictions about incentive manipulations on precision, as they affect the behavioral cost function.
Researchers have discovered that the Irish potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans uses a protein called PRD54 to interfere with the plant's autophagy process, which is a natural defense mechanism used by plants to protect against diseases. Autophagy involves the breakdown and recycling of cellular components to eliminate pathogens. PRD54 binds to the autagy protein ATG8, stimulating the formation of autagosomes and depleting the autagy receptor J2 out of AT8 complexes, thereby countering host defenses. This is the first time a pathogen has been shown to antagonize a host autagy receptor to counteract defenses. Unlike other pathogens, PRD54 activates autagy to eliminate defense-related compounds and reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling. The study shows that pathogens can activate autagy for their benefit, not just disrupt it, and highlights the complexity of plant-pathogen interactions. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms of defense-related autagy and how pathogens manipulate autagy for nutrient uptake.
Researchers have developed a novel in vitro model to study how human cardiac fibroblasts (CF) respond to combined mechanical and oxygen changes, mimicking pathological conditions such as ischemia. They used a multi-stimulus device to apply cyclic strain and controlled oxygen tension to primary human CF, revealing differential responses to individual and combined stimuli. Cyclic strain increased proliferation, YAP translocation, PDGF secretion, and collagen presence, while hypoxia and loss of contractility (2% strain) induced inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases release. This model recreates a pathological environment to understand CF responses during cardiac injury, replicating for the first time the combination of oxygen and mechanical cues, highlighting emerging cellular mechanisms. The study contributes to in vitro models of cardiac disease, which have been studied under physicochemical stimulation such as mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical proibrotic cytokines. The model provides insights into synergistic contributions of environmental signals in early CF activation relevant to fibrotic disease. In the proliferative phase of myocardial healing, excessive CF proliferation and phenotypic switch to fibrot response are observed. To understand environmental modulation of CF proliferation, the fraction of mitotic cells (PH3+/DAPI) under mechanical and oxygen changes was examined. The combination of H and reduced contractility elicited inflammatory and fibrot remodeling, while individual stimuli regulated proliferative and collagen responses. This has implications for myocardial remodeling and the model provides a tool for understanding pathological mechanisms and reparative strategies.
Researchers have identified two isoforms of the DOM nucleosome remodeling complex, DOM-A and DOM-B, in Drosophila, which are necessary for transcriptional regulation through distinct mechanisms. DOM-B incorporates H2.V, the fly ortholog of H2.Z, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR complex, while DOM-A functions as an ATP-independent histone acetylase complex similar to yeast Nu4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. This study provides an example of how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation, as seen in yeast and humans where nucleosome and histone acetylase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Dophila generates diversity through alternative splicing of a single gene. The DOM-A and DOM complexes have distinct domains, with DOM-A featuring a long ATPase domain, raising the possibility that it serves as a central subunit of a Nu4-type complex in Dophila, similar to the well-stud yeast complex. However, ATP activity of DOM is dispensable for H4 acylation by DOM-A, a principle conserved across metazoans. H2 is primarily found at promoters and enhancers, regulating initiation and elongation, and is introduced by the SWR complex in yeast.
Researchers investigated the role of β-catenin (Ctnb1) in motor neuron differentiation at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), a critical for proper interaction between motor neurons and muscle cells. Tn1 is essential for motor neuron differentiation, but little is known about the retrograde signal from muscle to neuron. Using an in vivo genetic approach, they found that the transcriptional activity of tn1 is necessary for presynaptic differentiation, while its cell adhesion function is dispensable. They identified Slit2 as a tn-directed retrograde factor, which, when expressed in muscle, rescues presynaptic deficits in tn1 mutant mice and induces synaptophysin puncta in spinal cord axons. This suggests Slit serves as a factor used by tn1 to direct presyn differentiation. Tn associates with Tcf/Lef-elements in the Sl2 promoter, and Sl2 expression is promoted by elevated tn. Sl2 is concentrated at the NMJ and transgenic mice expressing Sl2 in muscle diminish presyn deficits, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density, and depressed EPP.
Researchers have developed a method to quantify the dynamics of force transmission at cell-cell junctions in epithelial clusters with subcellular and multi-cellular resolution. They applied this technology to spontaneously forming adherent epithelial cell clusters and found that basal fluctuations in force were coupled to E-cadher localization at the level of individual cell junctions. At the multi-cell scale, cell force exchange depended on cell position within the cluster and was adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through a cell required modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomy contractility in the cell and its neighbors. This study provides insights into mechanisms controlling mechanical homeostasis in epithelial tissues and highlights the method as a resource for studying mechanotransduction in cell adhesions.

The researchers used a cell-cell force measurement method to quantify spatially and temporally the transmission of mechanical forces through cell-cell junctions of adherent epithelial clusters. Time-resolved measurements showed cell forces at junctions fluctuate over time during interphase and cell divisions. They investigated how basal variations were coupled to localization of molecular components cell junctions, focusing on Eadher, the backbone of adherens junction epithelial cells. Along the junction, local stresses correlated with Ead localization. Expanding to force fluctuation analysis at cell scale, found propagation intercepted by anchorage extracellular and actomy contraction. The method revealed transmission across cluster short-ranged, typically one cell diameter due anchoring forces by cell-matrix and actomy contractility.
Researchers have investigated the structure and function of huntingtin, a protein associated with Huntington's disease, to understand how its polyglutamine expansion causes the disease. They used biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and mass spectrometry to study the protein. Huntingtin is composed of five domains and has an α-helical soloid structure with amino and carbox-terminal regions forming a central cavity. Polyglut expansion increases α-hical properties and affects intramolecular interactions among domains. The study reveals characteristics of full-length huntingtin affected by polyutamine expansion, solving the puzzle of how the amino-terminal polyut tract confers disease-causing property.

A panel of purified recombinant human huntingins with varied polyut tracts were analyzed to determine the impact of polyut on structural features. Results suggest hunting may undergo conformation change upon interaction with partners. Single-particle microscopy of recombin humanins with polyut lengths 23 and 78-resid was performed to investigate the proposal that hunting's shape enables structural impact of amino polyut tract. Biophysical analyses of native recombin humanins provide a solution to the mystery of polyut position in modulating structure and function.

The α-helix content of hunting was measured using circular dichroism and plotted against polyut length. Results show a significant increase in αelix content with increasing polyut length. This suggests hunting's αeloid structure enables modulation of function by polyut tract size.
Ferritinophagy via NCO4 is a critical for erythropoiesis and is regulated by iron-dependent HER2-mediated proteolysis. N4 is a selective receptor for autophagic turnover of ferritin, a process essential for regulating intracellular iron availability. The interaction between N4 and ferritin is mediated by a key arginine in ferritin and a C-terminal element in N4, required for delivery to lysosomes via autophagosomes. N4 abundance is controlled by autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome. Ubiquitin-dependent N4 turnover is promoted by excess iron, involving an iron-dependent interaction between N and HER2 ubiquitin ligase. In zebraf and cultured cells, N4 plays an essential role in erythropo differentiation. This study reveals the molecular basis of the N-ferritin complex and how intracellular iron modulates N-mediated ferritinagy in an iron-dependent setting. When iron levels are high, N4 is low, promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture. Conversely, when iron is low, N levels increase to promote ferritinagy. N interacts directly with ferritin via conserved N-terminal and conserved ferritin residue. Mutation at binding sites abrogates in vivo and abolishes ferritinagy. HER2 uses its C-homology domain to recognize N under high conditions to mediate N turnover via ubiquitin-proteome, reducing N levels and increasing ferritin for capture. N-mediated ferragy is important for cellular homeostasis. N was identified as ubiqulation when V34 autagy activator inhibited and promotes ferragy.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP), a brain region crucial for higher-level cognition, but whose functional organization has remained unclear. They proposed that the LP is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing more abstract information for efficient and flexible cognition. However, support for this theory has been limited. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed rostral-caudal gradients of abstraction in LP, and dynamic modeling showed asymmetrical LP interactions indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to assumptions, the strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned midLP as the apex of the hierarchy. Moreover, cognitive demands modulated connectivity towards LP consistent with a role in integrating information control operations. The strengths of these dynamics were related to higher-level cognitive ability. These results suggest the LP is hierarchically organized with midLP synthesizing abstract and concrete to control behavior.

The study confirmed the rostral-caud axis of LP operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus-domain specificity and control. Interactions among LP sub-regions examined whether cognitive demands elicited asymmetrical influences of hierarchical processing. The hierarchical orientation of midLP in connectivity and top-down from rostral to midLP during control were positively related to higher-level ability. The organization of LP is tied to cognitive capacity. Data suggest top-down within LP is a determinant of higher function. Strongly asymmetrical projections from mid to other LP regions were related to higher ability, suggesting a beneficial hierarchy with mid at the apex.

Interactions within LP were examined by varying demands on domain and control. Collectively, demands engaged LP for a comprehensive account of function. Found progressively rostral processed abstract levels of control with Feature, Contextual, and Temporal eliciting rostral activations. Dynamic modeling showed hierarchical strongest in midLP. Demands elicited top-down from ro to mid and bottom from caud to mid. Analyses connectivity and modulations suggest mid forms a nexus where converges influence.
Researchers have identified a gene called TBCD1, which is specific to humans and their close relatives, that plays a crucial role in the development of the brain's outer layer, the cortex, and its folding. Cortical expansion and folding is linked to higher intelligence, but the mechanisms behind it are not well understood. TBC1 is duplicated in humans and their ancestors, but its role in brain development was unknown. The study found that expressing T1 in mouse brain cells in the womb led to the generation of a type of cell called outer radial glia, which are abundant in humans and great apes. Down-regulating T1 in human brain cells reduced the generation of these cells. Cells with T1 were found in areas of the brain that folded. This study shows a human gene required for outer glia generation and cortical expansion and folding. 

The researchers found that T1 promotes the generation of outer gl in mice with high proliferative ability seen in great apes. This generation is accompanied by cortical folding. Another human gene, ARHG11, promotes basal cells and folding in electropated mouse brain. T1 appeared before AR11 in human evolution and may control other genes in expansion and folding. This study shows brain development can be regulated by genes duplicated in human evolution. Cortical regions with electropated cells showed folding at 3 days postnatal. At 7, folding was more pronounced, suggesting T1 effect on formation. Delamination and proliferation of cells are required for T1 generation and folding. Researchers examined T effect on intrinsic signaling in cells. T in electoration at 13.5 reduced Tr1 expression in cells at 15.
Researchers investigated the role of ubiquitination in the transcriptional activity of the plant immune coactivator NPR1, which plays a crucial role in activating systemic acquired resistance in plants. They found that ubiquitination of NPR is a progressive event, with initial modification by Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL) promoting chromatin association and expression of target genes, while polyubiquination by E4 ligase U4 targets NPR for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities by UBP/7, proteome-associated deubitinases enhance NPR longevity. Immune transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E and E ligases balanced by deubitinases fine-tuning NPR activity without sacrificial turnover. Loss of U4 uncouples NPR target expression from proteome activity, highlighting progressive ubiquination's importance for NPR activity. CRL-mediated ubiquination is required for NPR to attain full transcriptional activity, while stepwise formation of ubiqu chains by U4 inactivates NPR and promotes degradation. Initial ubiquination boosts NPR transcription coactiv activity, enhancing promoter occupancy and genomic mobility. The study examined E4 ligases, which extend pre-existing ubiquitin chains, and found that U4/M3, implicated in degradation of NLR immune receptors, contributes to NPR ubiquination prior to degradation. Chains of four or more ubiquitin are necessary for proteas recognition, suggesting processive ubiquination provides a window for NPR to activate genes. The study indicates ubiqu chain extension and trimming can fineune transcription outputs of unstable activators without sacrificial turnover.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 siRNAs) guide cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. 24 siRNA biogenesis requires RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (R2) and DICER-like 3 (D3). However, siRNA precursors are mostly undefined. Researchers identified Pol and R2-dependent RNAs (PR RNAs) that accumulate in D3 mutants and are diced into 24 RN by D3 in vitro. PRs are mostly 26-45 and initiate with purine adjacent to pyrimidine, characteristics by Pol transcripts in vitro. R2 terminal transfer activity, demonstrated in vitro, may for occasional non-templated nucleides PR RNA 3 termini. The 24 siRN primarily correspond the 5 or 3 ends PRs suggesting a model siRN are from end PR duplex by single events.

Pol and R2 are essential for 24 si biogenesis and physically associate in Arabid and maize. Dozens PR can at a given locus, but individual PR represent Pol-R units. Data indicate short-stranded PR accumulate D mutants immediate precursors siRN, D3 cut precursors 24 RN vitro. Results consistent with Nagano et al. PR are dependent both Pol and R2. views 24 si loci abundant PR accumulate mutants also wild-type not mutants. 23 24 signals reduced ribonuc digestion, unaffected ribuc, si exists double-strand. PR accumulate mutants substrates D3. RNA isolated mutant incubated FLAG-tagged D3 affinity-purified transgenic anti-resin.
Researchers investigated the development of neural networks in the brain during the postnatal period using high-resolution electrophysiology in mice. They found that mature cortical networks emerge rapidly after a discrete but volatile period at the beginning of the second week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by neural quiescence, followed by spatially distributed, temporally precise, and organized activity. A similar developmental trajectory was observed in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. The researchers hypothesize that this quiescent period is necessary for the emergence of coordinated networks.

The transition between immature and mature network dynamics was marked by decreased cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second week. After this point, precise synchronization and oscillatory in space and time emerged robustly. Multiple functions emerge during early development, including precise spatiotemporal coordination of synaptic and cellular activity in brain functions. However, how networks develop into their mature form for complex cognition remains poorly understood.

The maturation of cortical dynamics is preceded by a discrete, evolutionarily conserved period during early development. During this, oscillations and spiking display a nad that shifts from local, loosely, sensory-driven patterns to internally, spatially distributed and temporally activity. The emergence of advanced network properties may be heralded by disappearance of immature patterns. Cortical microcircuits undergo changes in anatomical connectivity and functional between layers, initiated through increase in synogenesis in superficial layers. Neural spiking is recruited to oscillatory with strong, phase-lock, and higher precision, characteristic of adult networks in information processing.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to study the population structuring of multi-copy antigen-encoding genes in Plasium falciparum, a parasite that causes malaria. The model extends earlier "strain theory" by considering the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of unique repertoires in a population of hosts and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission. Empirical comparison of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of immune in structuring parasite diversity.

The model considers the effects of immune selection on populations with antigen-loci that are multi-copy and recombining. It explores the shaping of parasite populations resulting from selection exerted by competition among repires for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity. The model tracks all possible repires given a pool of genetic variants and whether structured populations emerge from selection pressures exerted by distinct repires for hosts.

The model is based on the var family of Plasium falcum, which encodes erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1), the major antigen of the parasite's blood stages that binds to host receptors to sequest within host tissues. The model suggests that control strategies reducing transmission will not drastically reduce gene diversity because a reservoir of parasite with diverse, non-overlapping repires will remain.
A bacterial effector protein from Shigella flexner, called OI, deamidates a glutamine residue in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC, converting it to glutamate (Q100). This modification disrupts the interaction between UBC and the RING ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, silencing the NF-κ inflammatory response. The study reveals that deidation inhibits UBC/TR6 interaction by three mechanisms: creating an intramolecular saltbridge in UBC that competes with a critical intermolecular saltbridge at the native interface, perturbing transient complexes necessary for association, and repulsion between negatively charged E100 and TR6 reducing transient interactions. This post-translational modification alters the conformation and stability of transient complexes, inhibiting protein-protein association.
Researchers investigated the effects of activating and inactivating two types of cortical interneurons, somatostatin-positive (S+) and parvalbum-positive (Pb), in the auditory cortex of awake mice using single-unit recordings. Contrary to the assumption that both activation and inactivation would provide consistent insights into interneurons' computational roles, the study found that inactivation of S+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivation of Pb interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, suggesting these neurons support separable functions. However, activating S+ and Pb interneurons showed no differences. A network model was used to understand this asymmetry, revealing that small changes in parameters, such as spontaneous activity or light strength of manipulation, determined whether activation or inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions about interne functions.

The study manipulated two families of cortical interneurons, S+ and Pb, while recording neural responses to tones in the auditory cortex of mice. To evaluate interne suppression of auditory responses, a linear framework was applied to 59 units from Ch2/S and 57 from Ch/Pb mice whose responses were tuned and suppressed by interne activation. Units suppressed by more than 80% were excluded to avoid floor effects, including narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units. Stimulus preferences of interne themselves are important for output, such as in auditory, Pb cells are rapidly activated by broad tones, while S inter respond slowly to narrower tones.

Optogenetically manipulating interne in the cortex, a neuron's FTC in light-on versus light conditions would reveal whether change is fit a model, and to what extent transformation multiplicative/additive, subtractive, or combination.
Researchers used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to externally modulate oscillatory activity in the right frontoparietal network, which supports working memory (WM), and found that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed that ACS effects depended on the relative phase of stimulation and internal processing. Specifically, synchronous ACS during the WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Functional connectivity results showed that the phase of frontopetal stimulation influenced information flow within the WM network. The study demonstrated a link between performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization across the frontopetal network activated by the task. Manipulations of ACS modulated underlying brain activity and ACS influenced long-range connectivity in a phase and state-dependent manner. The study tested four hypotheses: (1) WM performance was enhanced by entraining activity within the frontopetal network activated by demands; (2) brain activity in the frontopetal network was modulated in phase-dependent; (3) changes in blood oxygen level dependent on phase stimulation correlated with performance; (4) connectivity across brain regions was modulated in phase-dependent. Frontal interactions increased with synchronous stimulation, whereas posterior increased with desynchronous, suggesting information flow through brain involved in WM was differentially affected by varying phase. The study demonstrated the role of phase in cognitive WM processes and neural correlates with this process.
In vertebrates and amphibians, and fish, embryonic polarity is largely specified by maternal determinants that fix cell fates early in development. However, amni embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. Researchers sought to understand how polarity is determined in these embryos. In the chick, the earliest known factor is cV1 (homolog to mammalian growth factor 1, GDF), a transforming growth factor (Tβ) expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen for upstream regulators of c1 in normal and manipulated embryos to form twins uncovered the transcription factor Pit2 as a candidate. Pit2 is essential for axis formation and acts as a direct regulator of c1 by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Pit, V1/GDF, and Nodal are also key in left-right asymmetry, suggesting the same polarity mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.

A molecular screen for genes involved in earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity identified transcription factor Pit2 as a direct regulator of c1 during development and twinning. In invertebrates and amni vertebrates, embryonic polarity is established by localization of maternal determinants in cytoplasm/cortex of fertilized egg. This generates differences between blastomeres that form by division from egg, specifying orientation of embryonic axes. Higher vertebrates retain regulative development until late stage, suggesting localization of maternal determinants not essential for specifying polarity.

Results implicate Pit2 as earliest described gene regulating embryonic axis and twinning. Pit is a transcription factor expressed same as c in embryos and bisected marginal zone, before c. Time-course of Pit2 expression in whole and isolated halves compared to c.
Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors in response to odor gradients. To investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, researchers subjected flies to precisely defined odor waveforms and examined patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OS) and projection neurons (PN). A significant transformation between OS and PN spike patterns was found, with PN strongly signaling OS spike rate and rate of change. A two-dimensional model admitting OS rate and rate change as inputs predicted PN output. When cascaded with rate-change encoding OS, PNs signal acceleration and rate of dynamic stimuli to brain, enabling animals to respond to odor onsets.

PNs relay olfactory information to higher centers such as mushroom body and lateral horn. Recent studies reported Drosila OS encode concentration and rate as function of time. Building on this, researchers asked how PNs contribute to dynamic olfactory representations. First and second-order neurons in Dila olfactory system were tested with varying odor concentrations and a 2D model for processing olfactory information. Shape of 2D nonlinearity and low error supported hypothesis PN rate dependent on change of feed OS input.

It is crucial for insects to detect and respond to odor before drifting relative to plumes. Dila early system signals acceleration to brain. This encoding allows detection at early phase. Several studies investigated dynamic stimuli in early olfactory systems, observing significant processing (Bawat et al, 2007; Geffen et al,2009; Kim et al,201; Nag and,201; Martelli et,201). Together, acceleration in Dila lobe allows higher centers to respond onsets of rising stimuli.
In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with paternal cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilized products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb (Pc) protein family. Research has shown that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin, likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing Pc function. A study found that mutants of the MADS transcription factor AGL have impaired auxin transport from endos to integuments, resulting in seed abortion. It is proposed that AGL regulates auxin transport from endos to integuments, leading to removal of Pc block on seed development.

Data suggests production of aux in developing endosperm is trigger for seed development. To challenge this hypothesis, plants were investigated for MADS transcription factor A62. ag62 seeds abort after fertilization around 3-4 days after pollination, correlating with endos cellularization and failure to develop coat. A dual role for post-fertilization auxin production is proposed, driving endos and seed development. ag62 has defects in coat development in fertilized ovules and endos development in autonomous seeds, suggesting AGL and auxin mediate both endos and seed pathways.

Multiple lines of evidence support this hypothesis: aux rapidly accumulates in integuments after fertilization, impaired biosynthesis but not signaling in endperm causes defects in coat, ovules of transgenic producing ectopically in central initiate coat without fertilization, and failure development in ag62 correlates with failure. Coat initiation is generated in fertilized central/endos. Seed development requires production aux in fertilized central/endos and likely transport to ovule in AGL-dependent manner. Fertilization results in production aux exported to integ, lifting P2 block on development allowing elongation and differentiation.
Researchers have mapped the functional landscape of the receptor-binding domain of bacteriophage T7 using a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library). This method allowed them to create a large library of phage variants with single amino acid substitutions at every site, resulting in 1660 variants. They quantified the functional role of each variant on multiple bacterial hosts, generating high-resolution maps of regions with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific patterns, many of which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties, revealing adaptation to individual hosts. They discovered gain-of-function variants against hosts and host-restrict variants that eliminated certain hosts. To demonstrate utility, they engineered highly active T7 variants against urinary tract pathogen Escherichia coli. This approach presents a framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in phage-bacterial systems.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, rely on other dimensions such as duration during speech perception. This study investigated the neural basis of this strategy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 individuals with amus and 15 controls. Participants read sentences with indicated grammatical boundaries, then heard sentences differing in pitch and/or duration, and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amus group between left frontal language regions and right pitch-related areas, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. These connectivity differences were not present during a control task. Results indicate that perceptual dimension reliability is linked to connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism.

The study found individuals with amia, who rely less on pitch than controls to process language, exhibited decreased connectivity between frontal and right pitch regions. In the task, participants matched sentences with visually presented based on pitch, duration, or both dimensions. The study used fMRI to scan individuals with amia and controls to determine the reliability of auditory dimensions in speech perception. Results are consistent with an account that right auditory areas are not connected to frontal as during tonal tasks, but less integrated with left regions when processing language. No differences in activation during speech are consistent with reports that amics and controls do not differ in pitch representations. The extent of pitch-responsive regions within cortex is similar in amia and controls. Brain encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is unimpaired in individuals with amia. It is suggested that amics neglect pitch because they learned their memory is unreliable, and this down-weight is reflected in decreased connectivity between auditory and areas integrating regions.
Researchers have discovered a new contagious cancer, Devil Tum 2 (D2), in the Tasman devil, a species that already harbors a widespread cancer, Devilum 1 (D1). In contrast to D1, D2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, indicating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the highly expressed MHC I alleles in D2 cells are common among devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing alleles. In parallel, MHC I loss emerges in vivo, D2 may mimic the trajectory of D1. The study proposes that contagious cancers exploit histocompatibility between tumour and host, but loss allogenic antigens facilitate transmission of D2.

D2 cells can pass between individuals without host immune response protection, and conditions for emergence of contagious in species are unknown. D2 cells express M class I in vitro and vivo, unlike D1, which lost M I (Siddle et al, 2013). D2 express non-polym, non-class M I (SahaUK) reducing immunogenic. Classical M I with highest in D2 is shared with devils. M I varies among D2 in vivo, suggesting M subclones could emerge as D transmits. Results show D2 express M I, unlike D1 and contagious in dogs, CTV. Further analysis is needed to define host response D2 and tumour evolution. D1 cells are M I negative, possible D1 regulated I after transmissible and transmission among shared M alleles.

Similarity of M I between D2 and devils reflects shared range and genotype founder (Stnitz et al,201). Frequency among population may impact D2 spread. Heterogenic M in D suggests I not fixed and lost D2.
Researchers have investigated the neural circuits in the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG), a region critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, using optogenetic mapping in mice. They found a dissociation between parallel circuits in superficial SG that process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit low-rhease (LR) pyramidal cells in SG, while neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by clastral and cingulate inputs, sources of nonpatial information. Precise subaminar and dendritic arbor within SG layer 1 permits parallel processing. Thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation despite receiving direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. Parallel streams identify a principal subtype positioned to support spatial computations in SG.

The study highlights a retrosial circuit enabled by precise subamin organization of principal subtypes and axonal afferents. LR receive directional and spatial inputs from anterioralam and subulum. Synaptic thamic inputs to cells give rise to rate coding of angular speed in LR cells. Integrating these streams in downstream neurons within ipsilateral and contralateral gran and dysgran SG is crucial for understanding retrosial computations. Thalam and subulum preferentially control LR, while clastr and culate control RS. Synaptic thamic allow robust encoding of angular by LR models, though inputs only contain direction, not speed.

LR and RS pyramidal neurons in layer 3 of SG have distinct morphology and properties, making them suited to integrate direction from thalam and spatial from hippocamp via subulum. Integration of directional and distance is key function of retrosial as whole.
Researchers have identified a potential link between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the development of tauopathies, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition characterized by the accumulation of tau protein aggregates in the brain. To investigate the mechanisms behind the spread of tau aggregates after TBI, the study used zebraf, a fish model that expresses a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor to report tau accumulation. Zebraf larvae subjected to a novel TBI paradigm exhibited features of T, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and tau inclusions. The application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued T-induced tauopathy and cell death, suggesting a role for seizure activity in the prion seeding and spreading of tau following T. The study reveals postumatic seizures as a drable mechanistic link between T and the pr-like progression of tauopathy.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions, focusing on how the arrangement of cortical regions affects measures of brain connectivity. They found that the shape and location of brain regions strongly interact with modeling brain connectivity, and that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. The study suggests that cross-subject variations in spatial configuration of brain regions are often interpreted as changes in functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of understanding these effects when interpreting functional imaging data and cognitive traits.

The study aimed to identify how key aspects of resting-state functional MRI (rfMRI) data influence measures of connectivity and relate to trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals, addressing a significant confound in previous studies. Recent advances have tackled the issue of spatial misalignment across individuals. The organization of the brain into large-scale functional networks has been extensively investigated using resting-state functional MRI. Spontaneous fluctuations in brain regions as measured with rfMRI show correlations, revealing patterns of functional connectivity.

Partial correlation analysis showed that network matrices contain unique subject-level information not reflected in spatial organization of functional regions. The conceptualization of brain organization is relevant to interpreting findings. The implication is that subject information in adopted 'connectivity' largely reflects variability in location of regions rather than coupling strength, for methods mapping group-level parcellations onto data.
Researchers investigated the role of TBP and TBP2 in the activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells. They found that TBP, not TBP2, is the essential component of the pre-initiation complex (PIC) that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated muscles. TBP is expressed in myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts and primary mouse satellite cells, whereas T2 is not. TBP deficient mice showed intact regeneration potential and satellite cells isolated from T deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with same efficiency as wild-type cells. The study compared RNA profile of Tbp and T2 genes in satellite cells from wild-type mice and C2 myogenic cell line. T expression was detected in satellite-derived myotubes and C2 myotubes. However, the integrity of skeletal muscles in T2 mice during adult life was not explored, and the possibility that T2 promotes muscle expression in satellite cells was not ruled out. The requirement of T for skeletal differentiation and absence in myot suggest the TID complex may be present in myogenic and drive transcription during myoblast into myot. To test this hypothesis, T subunits of TID complex were detected in cultured C2 and satellite mylast myot at RNA and protein levels. No defects in satellite ontogenesis were found in absence T2 expression. Importantly, comparable satellite cells in muscles of WT and T mice 12 days after injury were detected, indicating intact capacity to proliferate, self-renew and differentiate during regeneration in absence T2.
Researchers used a large-scale optogenetic interface to stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocortic activity in the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex of macaques. The study aimed to investigate the effects of stimulation on large-scale network dynamics. Two measures of network connectivity were tracked: the response to focal stimulation and baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes, which were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S1 or M significantly strengthened functional connectivity between areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network, reflecting correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This work extends Hebbian plasticity to large circuits, with implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.

The study demonstrated a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network, explained by a Hebb model of large-scale-induced plasticity. Next, the impact of stimulation on connectivity between and within areas was investigated, testing whether stimulation-ev activity drives large network plasticity in a Hebb manner. The goal was to investigate large functional reorganization following stimulation, informing future neurorehab strategies. A large optogen interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of populations and large μ-ECo activity across S and M. First, two measures of functional connectivity were established, providing complementary views of plasticity. Hebb rules were used to explain synaptic plasticity, exploring if large stimulation changes are consistent with Hebb plastic. The Hebb model was tested by comparing correlations induced by stimulation with network changes after conditioning. Artifact-free signals allowed this test. Despite differences, both support a key role for Hebb in sensorimotor plasticity. Understanding the relationship requires study of intermediate timeframes and cortical mapping, important for future work. The interface enabled robust estimation of functional and stimulation-evoked correlations.
A study was conducted on a rhesus macaque monkey born without primary visual cortex (V1) to understand the neural consequences of damage to this area. The monkey's behavior was unremarkable, but visual task performance was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that structures outside the lesion were normal. Visual stimulation with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field dots activated pulvin. Cortical activation was sparse but included patches consistently across the lesion and control monkeys. Functional analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas correlated with V/MT activation without V. Despite subcortical responses to stimulation, there was little evidence for subortical input to V/MT supporting residual function or blindsight phenomena.

Visual structures, both cortical and subort, outside the lesion remained intact in the monkey with little atrophy, suggesting a role in residual function. An intact network of extrastate cortical areas was comparable to controls. Connectivity between subort regions and V/MT was weak, but microstructure intact. Enlarged ventricles within the lesion may have affected anesthesia pattern. Figure showed no V/MT activation to checkerboard or moving stimuli. Connectivity analysis was performed. Weakened tract between VMT and subort nuclei indicated little strengthening of connections underlies residual vision. Residual vision can manifest in determining information from faces, as in patient (Bur et al, 2013), suggested surviving loss V1. For motion, monkey showed activation in V/MT dorsal ST both hemispheres, possibly subthreshold difficult detect BOLD. Without strong V/ responses, a network of cortical areas showed similar B response VMT (Goodale, 201). Retinal may reach dorsal areas via LG and pular, but lack activation due anesthesia makes difficult. No differences between S and controls in pathways LG-VMT and pular-VMT suggests either support residual abilities.
The innate immune system's ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the intracellular environment is crucial for defense against pathogens. However, the mechanisms distinguishing between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus are not well understood. Researchers used biochemical and single-molecule techniques to study the innate sensor IF16 and found that it one-dimensionally scans long stretches of exposed dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular platforms. Nucleosomes prevent IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with this one-dimensional movement. This unique scanning-assisted mechanism allows IF16 to distinguish and assemble on foreign DNA efficiently.

 IF16 is a key immune sensor that detects dsDNA and assembles signaling platforms in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It plays a role in defense against pathogens such as herpes virus. Researchers observed a unifying mechanism explaining IF16's foreign-dsensing pathways. IF16 assembles faster on longer dsDNA composed of three domains: pyrin and two ds-binding domains. The one-dimensional assembly plays a role in IF16's immune responses. Chromatin acts as a feature allowing IF16 to distinguish host from DNA in the nucleus.
Researchers have developed a novel proteomics technique called spatially targeted microproomics (ST) that allows for the interrogation of micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, then soaked in a solution containing the photo-tag 4-benzylbenz-glyc-histidine. Confocal imaging with two-photon excitation is used to covalently photo-tag all proteins within ROI to a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. As a case study, amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse and post-mortem AD were examined, confirming known constituents and discovering new ones. ST can be applied to various samples including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo, specimens, biopsy, and post-mort tissue.

The technique combines two-photon laser microscopy with photochemical labeling and mass spectrometry. Two-ph excitation has been used for microscopic 3D-resolved photochemistry. Predominant photo-tagged protein in ST sample is Aβ, not visible in non-plaque due to low abundance. Photo-tag procedure uses two-ph microscopy, not conventional confocal. ST offers single-mic-scale 3D resolution better than current LCM, providing clues to neurodegenerative disease etiology and advancing cell biology research on small features not amenable purification.
The Frizz3 gene plays a crucial role in controlling axonal development in distinct populations of cranial and spinal motor neurons. Disruption of the Frizz (F3) gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial nerves, phrenic nerve, and dorsal nerve in fore and hindlimbs. In F3−/− limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the plexus, unlike the phenotypes of other axon-guiding mutants, F3−− dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to normal developmental cell death, coinciding innervation muscle targets in vivo, providing evidence that developing neurons with long axons are programmed to die unless axons arrive at targets on schedule.

In the limb, absence F3 leads to specific stalling among LM axons distinct from phenotypes produced by defects in other signaling active limb guidance. Affected cranial and spinal neurons die after axons, providing vivo evidence that axons arrive targets essential signals relay cell bodies. The cause of ax deficiency in VII, XII, phic, and limb in F− mice is: 1) motor differentiation, 2) excessive death, or 3) growth/guidance. Majority F− ax do not follow erroneous trajectories, aberrant pathfinding unlikely relevant. 5.5 is active independent ultimate target. One model precocious neuron in F− embryos invokes survival factors produced targets along ax trajectory, suggested co-culture with cord and plate (Wang and Tess-Ligne,199). A wave precocious death observed in− controls. Thus,− a subset exhibits ax growth apoptotic death E.11-E.5. Controlling growth may F function in motor neurons. F−,− and− brains have identical defects multiple tracts (Wang et al,200,2006;T et al,2005) and−−,−,− and− spinal commural horn neurons exhibit rostral defect.
Researchers investigated the role of transposable elements (TEs) as enhancers in the regulation of gene expression in embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Transposable elements are repetitive DNA sequences that have been co-opted by the embryonic and extraembry lineages of the early mouse embryo, but their functional significance in gene regulation is unclear. The study tested a set of long terminal TE families as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells using epigen and transcriptomic data, which suggested that a large number of TEs contribute to tissue-specific gene expression. Genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR interference of RL13 elements in embryonic cells revealed that only a minority play significant roles in regulation. The results suggest that a subset of T are important for gene regulation in early development and highlight the importance of functional experiments evaluating regulatory roles of T.

 The study used CRIS interference to test the regulatory roles of multiple TE enhancers in embryonic stem cells and found data consistent with chromatin accessibility that TE enhancers may support lineage-specific expression of subset genes. However, correlations may emerge without causal links between T and expression. To test functional role of TE enhancers in regulation, performed CRPR genetic excision of selected T. Validated small effect of TE enhancers on expression with additional genetic experiments. Chose RL13 elements displayed 2-fold H3ac levels upon CRi but little effect neighbouring expression.

 The study tested regulatory function of TE families in embryonic and trophlast stem cells using genetic and epigenetic approaches and compared with predictions from extensive analyses epigen and transcript data. Identified number of T drive expression lineage-specific genes. Genetic work necessary evaluate proportion TE act redundant with regulatory. Contrasting findings epigen work revealed large LTRH elements significant regulation nearly genes human carcinoma cell.
Researchers have investigated the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that has independently emerged in at least 60 plant lineages from the ancestral C3 pathway. A meta-analysis of 18 lineages with C3, C, or intermediate C-C photosynthesis was conducted to parameterize a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. A novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model was developed and experimentally verified to predict the evolution of the C4 phenotype. The study found that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. Ancestral and phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis determined the evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis. The order of C trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers, allowing for convergent evolution of the complex trait. A predictive model was developed to infer evolutionary trajectories from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data, providing insights into the evolution of the complex trait. The emergence of the C4 phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, making photosynthesis an ideal for mathematical modeling of trait transitions on an underlying landscape. Distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative histories in response to non-photosthetic pressures. Early events determined downstream phenotypes of C sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across space. Mechanistic diversity underlies multiple pathways generating C photos and may facilitate convergent evolution of complex traits, benefiting efforts to recapitulate acquisition through genetic engineering of C species.
Researchers studied the protein SpoIVA, a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. SpoIVA evolved from a TRAC class P GTPase, but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. They reengineered the nucleotide binding pocket of Spo to mimic its ancestral GTP activity and found that SpoAGTP functioned as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP intermediate required for polymerization. Incubation with ATP did not promote polymerization, revealing that the nucle base, in addition to energy from hydrolysis, is critical for specific functions. They also found that increased ATP levels relative to GTP at the end of sporulation drove the change in nucle preference in Spo. 

SpoAGTP, functional in vivo, could use either ATP or GTP to induce conformation change after hydrolysis, but polymerized only in presence of ATP, suggesting a requirement for the base, not energy from hydrolysis, for function. 5 hours after spor initiation, Spo is assembling the spore coat, suggesting selective pressure drove switch in specificity from GTP to ATP. Consistent with this, physiological ATP, not G, facilitated conformation in Spo and SpoTP. Both Spo and SpoTP failed hydroly-mediated changes in presence 0.06 GTP, but did so in 1.5 ATP. Examining polymer at different ATP concentrations, neither Spo nor SpoTP polymerized in 0.
A study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life by restoring leptin signaling at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice null for the leptin receptor (LepR) gene. The results showed that defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including poor development of arcuate nucleus projections, were recovered by Lep reactivation in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. Lep reactivation in adulthood also led to reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh expression and defects in reproductive and growth systems. The study revealed early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. Changes in leptin signaling during development may affect organization of neural circuits regulating energy homeostasis, favoring metabolic diseases later in life. Early postnatal leptin block leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. Lept or Lep deficiency reduces brain mass, disrupts projections from AR neurons to paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus, and causes behavioral and cognitive problems. The study evaluated consequences of lack leptin in life on brain development. Lept affects developmental processes, especially in brain. Rodents exhibit postnatal lept surge between first and second age not associated with changes fat or food intake. Findings contribute to understanding metabolic programming of metabolic, neuroocrine, and developmental consequences from absence leptin in life, especially in context of childhood obesity.
Arabidopsis thaliana heterotrimeric G proteins regulate immunity by directly coupling to the FLS receptor. The FLS receptor perceives the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the cytoplasmic kinase BIK. Heterotrimeric proteins composed of the non-canonical G protein XL2, the G protein AGB, and the G proteins AG1 and AG2 are required for FLS-mediated responses through an unknown mechanism. This study shows that in the pre-activation state, XL2 directly interacts with FLS and B1, and functions with A1 and AG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of B1, allowing immune activation. Following activation by fl22, XL dissociates from A1 and is phosphorylated by B in the terminus. The phosphorylated XL enhances production of reactive species (ROS) by modulating the NAD oxidase Rho. The study demonstrates the proteins are directly coupled to the F2 receptor and regulate signaling through pre- and post-activation mechanisms.

In this study, XL2, A1, and AG/2 modulate fl22-triggered immunity by coupling the FLS-B1 receptor. Prior to activation by fl, the proteins attenuate proteome degradation of B, ensuring signaling competence. After fl stimulation, XL dissociates from A, indicating ligand-induced dissociation of from. Importantly, introduction of a transgenic B1 restored fl-triggered responses and resistance in lg and ag mutants, demonstrating a function of the heterimer protein to maintain signaling in the pre-state. In addition to lig-induced dissociation XL from A, fl induces phosphorylation in the termin.

The results show proteins interact the F-B receptor during F signaling and are consistent with defects in responses and Rho phosphorylation in mutants. Proteins positively regulate and B stability. A is required for accumulation but not F and B. We show XL directly with F and B to regulate F-mediated immunity. These studies support plant kinases roles by coupling heterimer proteins. The proteins coupled the F receptor are subject to regulations during signaling.
Researchers investigated the Arabidopsis circadian clock at the single-cell level, examining its robustness and coordination across the plant. Under constant environmental conditions, they observed single-cell oscillations, albeit desynchronized, with two waves of clock activity: one going down and one up the root. Cell-to-cell coupling was evident, especially in the root tip. A model suggested that cell-to-cell coupling and period differences between cells generated the observed waves. The study revealed the plant clock's spatial structure, suggesting a decentralized system unlike the centralized mammalian clock, with multiple coordination points.

Using a reporter for the core gene CIRIAN ASSOCIATED 1 (CA), they examined the Arabid clock across the whole plant at single-cell resolution over days. Data showed coherent waves of gene expression, suggesting coupling. Coupling was estimated using the order parameter (Kuramoto, 1984) and a technique for mammalian circadian cells (Rougem and Naef,2007). Results showed damping at the plant level was due to desynchronized oscillating cells with different periods, not noise or low molecule numbers. Two waves of gene expression, up and down the root, combined with variable periods, caused desynchronization.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanisms underlying multi-talker speech perception in adults with clinically normal hearing. They found that multialker intelligibility varied widely among individuals, but could be predicted by neural-lock to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured through ear EEG recordings. Combining temporal processing, pupil-indexed listening, and FM accounted for 78% of variability in multialker intelligibility. Bottom-up and top-down markers of poor multialker perception were identified, which could inform next-generation clinical tests for hearing disorders.

A battery of behavioral and physiological tests was developed to account for nearly 80% of variability in multialker intelligibility, not involving linguistic cues. Individual variability was found in clinically normal hearing subjects, but neither measure correlated with multialker recognition thresholds. Individuals with steeper pupil functions had difficulty in multialker task, leading to correlation between pupil change and intelligibility (r = 0.53, p=0.03). The study aimed to develop objective markers explaining poor communication complaints in clinically hearing individuals. Data suggest association between psychophysical FM and speech-noise intelligibility attributed to early auditory encoding. A correlation between low FM and intelligibility might reflect fast processing fidelity and intelligibility.
Researchers have developed a method to non-invasively image and measure single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the living retina, a part of the central nervous system. The mammalian eye's transparency allows for a non-invasive view of microvess, but imperfections in the eye's optics blur microscopic retinal capillaries and blood cells. To overcome this, they used 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to measure blood flow in C57/BL6 mice without surgery or contrast. Measured flow ranged four orders of magnitude (0.0001-1.55µL/min) across vessel diameters 3.2-45.8µm. An ultrafast imaging pipeline and automated analysis measured millions of cell speeds.

The study achieved single-cell velocity measurement in all vessel sizes of mammalian retinal circulation, a problem due to automation needed for larger vessels containing thousands of cells per second. They paired ALO imaging with ultra camera to nonvas image cells without contrast. This enabled high-throughput measurement of hundreds of cells per second. Quantification of blood flow will be applicable to clinical approaches using same instrumentation.

The study innovated imaging strategies and algorithms to nonvas image cells in smallest to largest vessels (diameters 3.2-45.8µ) without contrast. They showed label-free adaptive imaging improved blood contrast in retina compared to dye techniques, especially high flow. The method may serve as window to microcirculation in CNS and systemic health. Combined imaging enabled single-cell resolution in tight and sparse formations. All cells were imaged near-infrared without dye. Resolution enabled sub-mic precision measuring diameters. 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied.
Researchers have identified a receptor-like kinase, Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SYK), as crucial for the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis in plants. However, the mechanisms that distinguish between these two symbiotic fates have been unclear. This study shows that ectopic expression of receptor-like genes, Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR), N5, and SYK initiate nodule organogenesis and nodulation gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpression of NFR or N5 associated with endogenous SYK in Lotus japonicus Epasis revealed that dominant SYK initiates signalling independently of N1 or N5 and upstream a set of genes required for generation of calcium-spiking in both symbes. Only SYK but not FR triggered expression of AM-related genes, indicating the receptors play a key role in decision between AM or root nodule symbiosis development.

The study used overexpression constructs of FR, N, N5, or unrelated EF receptor kinase (EF) for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. EF did not interfere with nodulation in wild-type plants. Endogenous full-length SYK was coimmunprecipitated with N and N, but not EF, demonstrating association of SYK and Ns. SYK-mediated signalling specificity may be explained by complex formation of SYK with N and N, and Lys-kinases that mediate recognition signals from the fungus, resulting in release of negative regulatory mechanisms or unbalanced stoichiometry of SY and putative negative regulators of AM and root symbiosis signalling.

Common symbiosis genes in legumes are required for AM and root nodule symbiosis, a subset is essential for generation or decoding of calcium-spiking. Lotus japonicus encodes RL Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SYK). Under conditions, SYK-N association was detected in absence of nod factor. Mammalian tyrosine kinases and plant RLs ligand-induced dimerization is critical in signal initiation. Nitrogen-fixing symbiosis legumes accommodate rhobia inside root cells in nodules that provide favourable environment for fixation. Expression of three symb RL constructs from Ubiquitin promoter leads to spontaneous nodule formation in transgenic.
Researchers have developed a new software toolkit called DeepKit, which enables fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning. Quantitative measurements are crucial for various scientific disciplines, including neuroscience and ecology, and state-of-the-art deep learning methods have improved data quality and detail by automatically estimating animal body parts from images or videos. However, current methods have limitations in speed and robustness. DeepKit addresses these issues with an efficient multi-scale deep model, StackedNet, and a GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for keypoint locations with sub-pixel precision. This improves speed by 2x with no loss in accuracy compared to existing methods. The toolkit is demonstrated with challenging animal estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of individuals. It reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across sciences.

The software, DeepKit, is built on state-of-the-art individual estimation using convolutional neural networks for fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization. The new estimation model, Stacked, offers improvements over existing models. Code, documentation, and examples are available at https://github.com/graving/deepose under an open-source license. The goal is to achieve fast estimation by Pereira et al (2019) while maintaining predictive power of models like DeepCut Math et al. These advances could lead to higher-resolution, reliable datasets revolutionizing understanding between behavior, brain, and environment. DeepKit measures animal posture from images achieving fast using CNNs relies on GPU processing large batches or downsampling, increasing error Math and Warren (2018). Stacked model can run at 30-110 Hz depending on resolution. In contrast, computer vision methods, deep-learning can achieve human accuracy by annotating data and training a CNN to estimate body parts directly.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which innate immune cells, such as macrophages, sense and respond to infection by intracellular pathogens. They found that disruption of glycolytic flux, the process by which cells break down glucose for energy, triggers the assembly of inflamomes, multi-protein complexes responsible for initiating inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, a form of cell death. This signal is mediated by a drop in NAD levels and increase in mitochondrial ROS production, which can be rescued by adding products that restore NAD production. This mechanism is important for host response to intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimur, which disrupts host glucose metabolism.

Typhimur infection impairs NAD production, leading to mitochondrial ROS formation essential for NLR3 inflamome activation. Disruption of glycol flux is a biologically relevant trigger for NLR3 inflamome activation, mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, linking cellular metabolism to inflammation initiation. Innate cells sense metabolic production and flux through glycol pathway, activating NLR to initiate responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and tyim limit glycol through distinct mechanisms, resulting in NLR3 inflamome formation and pyptosis.

NAD consumption increased upon pyruate treatment, indicating productive metabolism downstream glycol in infected BMDs. Data indicate glycol perturbation a mechanism innate sense homeostasis during tyim infection and induce pro-inflammatory via NLR inflome and pypt death. Functionally, innate cells sense metabolic perturbation as danger, inflamome, caspase activation, and cytokine secretion. Results suggest disrupting gly flux serves trigger inflammation and death in macroages. Disturbance gly flux by intracellular pathogen S.
Researchers have identified a novel DNA-binding site in the PALB2 protein, which plays a crucial role in homologous-directed repair (HDR) in cells. PAL2 is a tumor suppressor linked to various malignancies, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia, and coordinates BRCA1 and BRCA2 functions during HDR and interacts with chromatin proteins. The PAL2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain (NDB) stimulates RAD51 recombinase activity and surprisingly possesses strand exchange activity without RAD51. Moreover, NDB stimulates inverse strand exchange and can use RNA as a substrate. The study reveals a versatile interaction of PAL2 and highlights the importance of PAL2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells. Mutations in four amino acids reduce RAD51 formation and HDR efficiency by 50% in a cell model system. PAL2-DB itself stimulates RAD51 strand reactions. The data demonstrate a novel activity of PAL2 and highlight the importance of PAL2 DNA in chromosome maintenance. PAL2 interaction with DNA is critical for BRCA and RAD51 recruitment to DSB and efficient repair in cells. The study also shows PAL2-DB stimulates RAD-mediated strand exchange in vitro.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterial protein Mre, a prokaryotic actin homologue, forms antiparallel double filaments in vitro and in vivo. Unlike other actin filaments, which are composed of pairs of protofilaments arranged in a parallel fashion, Mre protoaments adopt an antipar arrangement. Crystal structures of Caulobacter Mre reveal the antipar protoaments, a novel architecture among actin proteins. The antipar arrangement allows each subunit to interact with membrane-bound components of the elongome and enables non-polar assembly and disassembly of filaments. The mechanism of protofil formation is similar to other actin proteins, involving domain closure upon polymerization. Co-crystallization with antimicrobial agents A22MP reveals their inhibitory mechanism and sheds light on ATP hydrolysis during polymerization.

The antipar arrangement of protoaments is unprecedented in the actin family, ensuring amphipathic helices bind to membrane and protoaments interact with bitopic proteins. Deleting the N-terminal amphathic helix and hydrophobic loop residues makes the protein prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of Caulobacter M shows the typical actin fold, two domains on either side of the nucleotide cleft, separated into subdomains A and B. The antipar protoaments are essential for Mre's function in cell shape maintenance, demonstrated by in vivo site-specific crosslinking of antipar orientation in E. coli. Cryo-EM shows pairs of protoaments tightly bind to membranes. Crystal structures of nucleotide and polymer states reveal conserved conformation changes accompanying antipar formation.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis for the difference in petal number between Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirs, two closely related species. They found that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 (AP1) accounts for the species-specific difference in petal robustness. The effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions, where A. thaliana AP masks the phenotypic expression of petal quantitative trait loci in C. hirs, conferring robustness. C. hirs AP1 fails to complement this function of A. thalian AP, conferring variable petal number. Regulatory regions of AP contribute to this divergence. Petal number is maintained in C. hirs despite standing genetic variation in accessions producing four-pet flowers.

The study identified AP1 as a major gene effect in the transition from robust four-petaled A. thalian to variable petal in C. hirs. AP polymorphisms do not directly contribute to within-species variation in C. h petal number. Instead, decanalization of petal in A thalian reflects robustness to genetic variation. Complementing A thalian AP mutants with C. h AP1 locus mimics variable pet number in C. h. This suggests hidden variability in the regulatory network controlling pet number in A thalian beneath uniform wild-type development.

Floral organs with pet identity show no variation in number outside second whor, as predicted by ABC model. AP is ectopically expressed in third whor petals of mutants C. Ectopic expression AP is associated with invariant petals, whereas endogenous AP in whor two C floral meristem is associated variable pet number.
Proinsulin misfolding is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes. The synthesis of insulin, critical for metabolic homeostasis, begins with the folding of the proinsulin precursor, including the formation of evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. Normal pancreatic islets contain a subset of proins molecules with at least one free cystine thiol. In human or rodent islets with perturbed endoplasmic reticulum environment, nonproinsulin enters intermolecular disulf-linked complexes. Genetically mice with wild-type islets, disulf-linked of proins are abundant, and leptin-deficient mice, the increase of such complexes with onset islet deficiency and diabetes. Proulin-Cys (19) and Cys (20) are necessary and sufficient for proins disulf-linked complexes; pro-Cys (19)-Cys (19) coval homimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting structural basis aberrant proins formation. Increased proins misolding via disulf-linked is early associated with prediabetes that wors β-cell dysfunction in type diabetes.

A subfraction of proins molecules in the ER bear unpaired cystine.

SUVH1 is a histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9)-specific methyltransferase that targets peric regions and is crucial for assembling heterochatin. It recognizes trimethylated H3K (H3me3) via its chromodomain (CD) and H3me allows SUVH to target chromosomal regions. However, the detailed mechanisms, especially for chromatin without preexisting H3me, are poorly understood. This study shows SUV1's CD (SUV1-CD) binds nucleic acids and this is important for its function in heterochatin assembly. SUV-CD had higher affinity for RNA than DNA and its ability to bind nucleic was independent of H3me recognition. SUV bound major RNAs in vivo and knockdown of major RN lowered SUV retention on peric. SUV mutational studies indicated that the nucleic-binding and Hme-binding of SUV-CD were crucial for perentric heterochatin assembly. These suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to SUV's specificity.

SUV1-CD's nucleic activity integrates with recognition and binding of methylated H9 to establish SUV-mediated perentric heterochatin such as Hme formation, HP accumulation, and repressive status. Also, SUV bound major RNA in vivo dependent on nucleic activity and knock of RN lowered SUV retention on peric heterochatin. Data suggest chrom-bound contribute to targeting and retention of SUV at regions. In addition to establishing Hme, SUV-CD's RNA activity contributes SUV's association Hme-rich per regions. Knock of major transcripts further supports that RNA binding SUV contributes stability chrom. Intriguingly, SUV-YA interacted partially with major RN. This does not fit model SUV-CD's RNA and Hme activities cooperatively function in SUV's chrom targeting However, also found SUV-YA loosely chrom. Considering, SUV-YA may interact RN without binding chrom.

Furthermore, found HP-binding and chrom activities SUV's N-terminal contributed SUV-mediated perentric Hme formation. Collectively results demonstrated different SUV other than lysine activity cooperatively regulate SUV-mediated perentricochatin.
Researchers investigated the role of the entorhinal cortex in spatial processing, specifically whether grid cells' activity depends on physical movement. Grid cells in the entorinal cortex allow for precise spatial decoding and have been hypothesized to contribute to various cognitive functions. A prerequisite for this hypothesis is that grid activity does not depend on physical movement. The study found that movement of attention, without physical movement, elicits spatial fields in the entorinal cortex. Monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus in the periphery and identified a significant population of entorinal cells with spatially structured fields. This contrasts with recordings in the hippocampus where grid-like representations were not observed. The results provide evidence that macaque entorinal cortex neurons do not rely on physical movement.

The study tested the hypothesis that grid cells participate in cognitive functions by recording units in the entorinal in monkeys performing a covert attention task. The results provide strong evidence that activation of entinal cells with spatial fields does not require physical movement. Previous demonstrated that stationary grid cells can be activated by eye movements as monkeys explore scenes. To examine spatial representations in the entinal during covert attention, the activity of 141 neurons in entinal of rhesus macaque performing covert tracking was recorded. Monkeys maintained fixation while attending a small dot moved around the monitor. The neural for overt and covert is largely overlapping, suggesting entinal cells can represent not only location but locus in general. The investigated whether fields entinal are activated by covert attention in absence of physical. Monkeys performed at accuracy with errors due saccades outside the window Depending motivation completed cycles. To examine spatial entinal neurons, the standard measure was evaluated Sol et al; Lang et al; Brandon et
Researchers have developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice that produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. The task, called perceptual value-based decision-making, was trained in 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, with over 5 million choices collected into a publicly available database. Learning speed varied across mice, but once trained, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories relied similarly on visual stimuli, past successes, and failures, and estimates of stimulus probability to guide their choices. These results demonstrate that complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and providing an unprecedented dataset and open tools to study decision-making in mice. The study suggests a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through open-science approaches.

The researchers implemented identical equipment and protocols to study mouse behavior across laboratories. Mice learned the task in all laboratories and performed comparably after learning. They adopted comparable reliance on visual stimuli, past, successes, and estimates of prior probability. To facilitate reproducibility, an open science approach was adopted, sharing hardware, software, and protocols. It is recognized that data and techniques should be available to the broader community (Bdo et al, 2019; Charles et al). Results from a large cohort of mice demonstrate reproducible methods and results across laboratories. Most mice learned the task, often at different paces, and performed comparably, with no differences.

Physiological studies of decision are carried out in mice to access genetic, imaging, and tools for brains (Carini and Church, 201; Glick et 2014; O'Connor 2009). The International Laboratory aims to explore the basis of behavior in multiple laboratories. Results can be compared, knowing differences unlikely due to behavior. Resources will catalyze new adaptations and variations, accelerating high-quality studies of neural correlates.
Researchers have created a comprehensive atlas of gene expression and cell types in the intestine of Schmidtea mediterrane, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate its organs, including the gut. Using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing, they identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression previously undetected by other approaches. Systematic analysis revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Spatial LCM uncovered regionalized gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially among intestinal goblet cells. Two intestine-enrich transcription factors, gli-1 and RE2, were identified to regulate regeneration and maintenance of goblet cells, respectively. The planarian transcriptome is a resource for investigating mechanisms in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration.

The study identified 22 intestine-enrich transcription factors, including those required for production and maintenance of goblet cells, setting the stage for further studies of this type. Characterization of the planarian transcript provides a framework for next steps. Methods for applying LCM to planarian tissue were developed to define expression and types in the intestine. The intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, storage, transport, immunity, and other roles, demonstrating homology with digestive systems of other animals, including humans. A detailed description of intestinal types facilitates studies of digestive cell. The RNAi phenotypes of gli-1 and RE2 suggest distinct mechanisms govern goblet differentiation and maintenance. Observations reinforce conservation intestinal expression and indicate roles performed by human digestive organs consolidated in the planarian. The transcript enables identification of genes for regeneration and functions of distinct intestinal types.
Researchers have discovered a novel mechanism of sensory coding in the peripheral nervous system of weakly electric fish, where receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. This contrasts with receptors insensitive to waveform variations that produce oscillating potentials. The oscillating receptors are most sensitive to frequencies found in collective signals of conspecifics and correlate with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies, indicating different perceptual capabilities correspond to receptor physiologies. 

The study investigated how divergence in sensory perception relates to differences in peripheral coding in Mormyrid fish, which communicate by producing species-specific electric discharge (EOD) at variable interpulse (I) intervals. Oscillating receptors are tuned to lower frequencies than peak frequencies of conspecific EOD and confer sensitivity to I that can only be produced by groups, whereas spiking receptors detect signals from individuals. Playback experiments showed species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond I within range of enhanced sensitivity. This novel coding may represent adaptation for detecting signals from groups of fish. Oscillatory activity is widespread in neural networks.

Behavioral experiments tested hypothesis that species with oscillating receptors exhibit selective responses to subisecond I and species spiking do not. A single fish was presented with a train of conspecific E at constant I. Results showed species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to subisecond I and species spiking did not, supporting the hypothesis.
Researchers have determined the 3.5 Å resolution cryo electron microscopy structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1, which infects and kills Bordetella species that cause whooping cough. The structure reveals two major protein folds: jellyroll for the capsid protein (CP) and HK-like for the major capsid protein (MCP). Notably, the topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the Johnson fold previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. The new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old, with β-sheet and electrostatic interactions contributing to non-covalent chain formation in BPP, unlike coval interprotein linkages in HK97. The termini of both CP and MCP are positioned for D-based phage engineering.

The atomic description of BPP head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-coval molecular interactions of bacteri capsid formation, and clarify relationships B- MCP and CP with other viruses. The 3D structure of BPP was determined by single-p cryoEM and an atomic model derived. BPP is a short-tailed ds virus and member of Podiridae, infecting and killing Bordella causing whooping in humans and mammals. It has T icosahedral caps, 670 in diameter. A 7 resolution BPP showed capsid has HK-like fold with an additional protein component.

BPP and MCP adopt two major folds, jelly and HK/Johnson. The Johnson in B MCP is non-circular perm compared to known topology. Until now, Johnson has been observed in Siphiridae and Myiridae families, exemplified by gp of HK97. The 5 Å map bears same B topology as reported and detailed in this study. B and HK represent only feasible of Johnson. All known structures with Johnson adopt HK, including gp of HK in Siphidae.
Researchers investigated how the deng virus (DENV) adapts to different host environments by serially passing it through human and mosquito cell lines and analyzing the effects of single nucleotide variants on fitness using ultra-deep sequencing. They found that a large influx of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare host-specific beneficial mutations, shaping adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the proteome and cluster in defined regions of the genome. These phenotypically adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. Evolutionary constraints in this system mirror those observed in DENV and Zika strains, indicating key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term evolution.

The study quantified the cost of deleterious mutations across the DENV genome, highlighting negative selection shaping diversity in viral populations. It will be interesting to understand how functional and structural features shape these patterns and contribute to overall fitness. Examples illustrate the ability to recapitulate and identify shifts in DM to uncover mechanisms of selection and adaptation operating on DENV in cells and populations. Clusters of mutations in regions suggest elements targeted by selection in each host.

Analysis reveals fitness as a balance between beneficial and deleterious alleles during adaptation. Adaptation relies on host-specific mutations clustered in regions of DENV and enriched regions with structural flexibility. CirSeq characterized fitness landscapes of DENV adapting to human and mosquito cells by tracing allele trajectories for all single nucleotide variants. This reveals positive and negative selection shaping evolutionary paths in distinct environments. Notably, beneficial mutations clustered at specific locations, suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of host selection. Allele values mapped on three-dimensional structure of DENV E, a transmembrane protein forming outer layer of envelope.
Researchers used single-particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (sPALM) to study the behavior of KRas12, an active mutant form of the Ras protein, on the cell membrane of U2 cells. They found that KRas12 exists in three distinct states: an immobile in 70 nm domains, embedded in a larger 200 nm domain that confers intermediate mobility, and the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. KRas is continuously removed from the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, similar to internalization and recycling. Importantly, the diffusion and trafficking properties of KRas remain invariant over a range of expression levels. The study reveals how membrane organization dictates diffusion and trafficking of Ras and offers insight into spatial regulation of Ras signaling. 

The partition of KRas into three states remains over a wide range of KR expression, demonstrating KR diffusion and trafficking through mobility and nanodomains is maintained homeostatic. Data paint a picture of spatiotemporal KRas on the membrane, providing basis for understanding of Ras multimer formation and signaling. A model was defined to demonstrate intermediate and imm states of KR are associated with distinct membrane domains. Sizes of immobilization and intermediate domains KR were 70 and 200 nm, consistent with nanoscopic membrane regulating Ras organization. A new model proposes membrane dynamics KR, where nanodomains dictate diffusion and trafficking, implications in multimer and signaling.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling gradient formation in the dorsal-ventral axis of vertebrates and invertebrates, specifically in zebraf embryos. The prevailing view in vertebrates is that BMP gradient formation occurs through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. However, this study quantified BMP activity in wild-type and mutant embryos and combined with mathematical modeling to test hypotheses for gradient formation, ruling out shutling and transcriptionally-formed mechanisms. Instead, a source-sink mechanism was proposed, where a restricted antagonist acts as a sink to drive BMP dorsally and form the gradient. Bmp2 diffusion supported this model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.

A quantitative imaging method was established to measure BMP signaling in zraf embryos, integrated with mathematical modeling to inform model selection. The model provided key parameters to identify the mechanism forming the BMP gradient. The hypothesis that BMP gradient largely reflects bmp expression was tested, but not supported. Through quantification and modeling, a new mechanism was presented where antagonists and ligand establish BMP patterning the DV axis in zraf.

BMPs act as morphogens in development, including patterning the embryonic axis, neural tube, and Drosila wing. BMP systems are established by extracellular regulators. In vertebrates, the mechanism of BMP and antagon shaping the gradient is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include an inverse of antagonists shaping the gradient, and antagon generating peak signaling by shuttling ligand.
Researchers have characterized a previously uncharacterized lysosomal protein, MF1, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters. MF1 is not glycosylated and contains a dileucine-based sorting motif necessary for its transport to lysosomes. Mice lacking MF1 develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics analysis of lysosomes from MF1 knockout mice revealed GL as a critical accessory subunit for MF1. MF1 and GL physically interact, with GL essential for maintaining normal levels of MF1 in lysosomes and vice versa. GL knockout mice mimic the phenotype of MF1 knockout mice, indicating a tightly linked MF1/GL lysosomal protein complex.

MF1 is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady state, not glycosylated, ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues, and transport to lysosomes mediated by dileucine sorting motif in N-terminus. To determine physiological functions of MF1, MF knockout mice were generated. Differential proteomics of liver lysosomes from wildtype and MF1 mice identified GL as essential for MF1. GL is highly glycosylated lysosomal protein of unknown function. Deficiency MF1 leads to reduced GL and vice versa.

MF1 belongs to major facilitator superfamily transporters, mediating secondary or passive processes over cellular membranes. Previous studies identified novel lysosomal transporters, this study characterized one candidate, MF1 in detail. Identified GL as essential subunit MF1 and role in liver and LSEC homeostasis. Data indicate MF not transporter for tested amino acids under conditions. Deficiency MF affects lysosomal composition. Lys from wildtype and MF mice isolated by differential centrifugation sucrose centrifugation injection mice Tylox.
Researchers have gained insight into the process of microtub transport by kines motors, which is essential for various cellular processes in eukaryotes, by developing atomic models of nucleotide and ATP states of the moneric kines motor domain microtules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5-Å resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of AD-bound kines, a mechanistic scheme was inferred where microtule attachment, mediated by a conserved 'chpin' residue kines (N255), triggers clam opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of AD. Binding of ATP closes the cleft in a manner tightly coupled to translocation of cargo, via kines'neck' element. These transitions are reminiscent of analogous nucle-exchange steps in myosin and F-ATase motors and inform how two heads of kines dimer gate each other to promote stepping microules.

The mechanism allows microules to regulate kines affinities for AD and ATP by modulating conformation of switch, yielding structural basis for kines nucleotide behavior on microules. Several sites in kines have been identified that uncouple motor nucleotide from micro affinity, but structural basis of uncoupling remained unclear. To clarify kines microtule cycle, high-resolution cryoEM reconstructions of human moneric kines motor (K349) attached to microtules in different states were obtained, representing motor before and after binding nucleotide in presence of AD-aluminum (AD•Fx). Nucleotide and ATP models of kines-microt complex are depicted, as well as X-ray structures AD-bound kines K construct (PDB:1MJ, which undocked and docked linkers). Cry-analysis of AD and ATP-bound states NK mutant support hypothesis, revealing previously unidentified modes kines attaching to microule but rotationally.
Researchers have identified a novel quality control (QC) pathway for misfolded proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two temperature-sensitive (ts) proteins, sam-2Hs and sen-1Hs, were found to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteome system. Ubiquination of sam-2Hs is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, while sen-1s is ubiquinated primarily by San1. Mitochondrial degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires the Hsp70 and HspS1 chaperones, providing evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD. Additionally, a role for the C48-N4-U1 AAA-ATase complex and a mitochondrial transmembrane C48 adaptor U2 are implicated in degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway combining cytosolic and mitochondrial factors, distinct from other cellular pathways.

The study establishes roles for ubiquination and proteasomal degradation in turnover of sam-2s and sen-1 at the OM. Only two ubiquitin ligases known to act on mitochondrial proteins in yeast are SCdm30 and R5. However, known substrates for these E3s are native. Knowledge of QC in ER, cytos, and nucleus derives from study of proteins undergoing temperature-dependent misfolding and degradation. To elucidate how misfold mitochondrial proteins are targeted for destruction, two yeast ts alleles, sam- and sen, were exploited. Pathways converge post-ubitination, where C48-N4-U1- complex and coactors facilitate unfolding/extraction of substrates from environments prior targeting 26 proteomes for degradation. Mitrial proteins subject ongoing insults resulting damage, misolding, dysfunction.

Ubiquinated forms of ts proteins localized to mitochondria under proteome impairment. Ubiquinated sam-2s and sen- accumulated in mitochondrial pellet correlating unmodified species. Deletion proteome shuttling factor D1 did not affect degradation sam- or sen, distinguishing MAD. Results indicate ubiquinated substrates require C48-N1 complex efficient proteomal. C48 can recruited substr via interaction coactors.
Researchers used a genetically engineered mouse model to visualize the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin, in real-time. They found that under normal conditions, ERK activity occurs in bursts and spreads radially from cell to cell, with the frequency of this propagation correlating with the rate of epidermal cell division. This phenomenon, called Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity (SPREAD), was stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoyphol-13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and their ligands. When the skin was wounded, ER activation propagated as a wave parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ER activation can be superimposed. Additionally, the researchers found that SPs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. The study provides new insights into how proliferation and ER activity are synchronized in a living tissue.
Researchers have investigated the cyanobacterial circadian clock, a biological oscillation that regulates daily physiological changes, and found that it follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday conditions with variable day length. The core oscillator, comprised of Kai proteins, behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that the dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. A mathematical framework was developed based on instantaneous transformation of the cycle by external cues, which predicts clock behavior under various environments. The entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a framework with a small number of parameters, guiding the design of experiments to probe molecular origins of key features. The defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates such experiments, but the model is general, expected to be useful for other organisms as well.

Cyanobacteria present a unique opportunity to elucidate molecular mechanisms in circadian biology as the oscillator responsible for genome-wide transcription rhythms can be reconstituted using Kai proteins, and have been extensively studied biochemically in conditions. Biochemically simulated effects in reconstuted Kai oscillator by driving proteins with pulses of nucleotides on a 24 cycle, simulating vivo conditions during day and night, shows similar scaling of clock with simulated length, indicating mechanisms for adaptation are intrinsic to proteins.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Meis as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in the general population. They found that Meis inactivation in the neural crest leads to altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythm in adults, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and conduction defects, increasing susceptibility to SCD. Meis is a major regulator of sympathetic target innervation, and Meis deficient neurons die from embryonic to perin stages due to apoptosis. Additionally, Meis regulates transcription of molecules necessary for endosomal machinery, and traffic of Rab+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis-inactivated neurons. This suggests Meis interacts with trophic signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons.

Meis regulates transcription of proteins for retrograde transport, endosomes, formation, and functioning. Genetic inactivation of Meis in rodents results in imbalanced sympatho-v regulation of heart functions, leading to conduction defects, chron incompetence, and S. Meis acts independently of studied transcription factors governing specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later differentiation. The study investigates Meis participation in cardiac regulation by intervening sympathetic differentiation and Meis mutations mediating unexplained S. Loss of Meis function in sympathetic leads to imbalanced sympatho regulation cardiac functions in mice, resulting in increased S.

Following Meis inactivation in neurons, traffic of Rab+ endosomes is impaired and target innervation compromised. Results complement study by Mahmoud et al, demonstrating Meis in regulation of cardiomyocytes mitosis following myocardial infarction. However, cardiac functions not affected Meis inactivation or overexpression in cardiomyocytes. Me family participates cardiogenesis Stunas et al, Mahmoud et.
Researchers have studied the formation of biofilms, complex communities of bacteria attached to surfaces, and found that mechanical instabilities, such as wrinkling and delamination, play a crucial role in shaping their morphology. Using Vibrio cholera as a model, they combined measurements, theory, simulation, image analysis, surface characterization, and mutagenesis to show that interfacial energy drives the creation and annihilation of new and existing interfaces. This process, called mechanorphogenesis, is linked to biofilm expansion and shapes the overall biofilm contour. The study suggests that exploiting mechanical forces in morphogenesis is an ancient and reused process, occurring in bacteria and eukaryotes. Biofilms serve as a model to investigate the role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and provide a system for morph-engineering. 

The researchers propose a mechanorph model where biofilms wrinkle and delaminate due to compressive stress. They tested this by inoculating V cholera biofilms onto agar and allowing them to collide. They found that Δz P aerugin mutant forms radial wrinkles and delaminations due to the same mechanical instability in V cholera. This illustrates how regulation of cell physiology can be coupled with mechanical instability to promote bio surface morphologies. Theoretical work on biofilms has considered mechanical instabilities. The study suggests new genes or compounds altering bio morphology by mechanics could be discovered to address bio-related problems.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor NRS in the development of epilepsy, a condition characterized by abnormal neuronal networks following severe seizures. They found that NRS levels increased in the hippocampus after seizures, but surprisingly, only a subset of potential NRS target genes were repressed. Blocking NRS function rescued these repressed genes, suggesting selective regulation. The subset of repressed genes had moderate binding to NRS, making them sensitive to fluctuations in NRS levels. These genes coded for ion channels, receptors, and other contributors to neuronal function, indicating their repression may contribute to epilepsy pathogenesis. The study used large-scale transcript arrays, qPCR, ChIP, and GSEA to examine NRS-dependent expression during epileogenesis. A twofold to threefold increase in NRS led to repression of only a subset of potentially regulated genes, rescued by interfering NRS function.
Researchers have investigated the parallel processing of sensory information in the mammalian olfactory system, specifically the pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells, and the emergence of feature selectivity in these types via lateral inhibitory circuits. They found differences in activity-dependent inhibition between mitral and tuft cells, likely due to differences in activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations showed that these circuit differences allow mitral and tuft cells to discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different stimulus intensity may be a function of these parallel pathways.

In the mammalian olfactory system, olfactory sensory neurons excite two classes of projection neurons: mitral and tuft cells. Similar to the visual system, feature selectivity in each type emerges from connectivity to specific cells. In the retina, selectivity in ganglion cells is due to bipolar and amacrine cell connectivity. Similarly, differences in odor-evoked responses in mitral and tuft cells emerge from connectivity to olfactory sensory neurons and tuft cells. The combination of activity-dependent inhibition at low and intermediate rates enables tuft and mitral cells to encode odors better than either alone, supporting computations unlikely with a single neuron.

The study proposes a mechanism of activity-dependent lateral inhibition in mitral and tuft cells. The olfactory circuit consists of mitral tuft cells, presynaptic tuft cells, recorded tuft cells, and associated granule cells. Parallel pathways are common in sensory systems, but how local circuit creates selectivity in pathways is poorly understood. This is particularly relevant in areas with distinct outputs from homogeneous sources, such as the olfactory. In the olfactory bulb, firing olfactory neurons excites mitral and tuft cells.
Researchers investigated the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allosteric effects in the M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allosteric GPCRs. They compared monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor to identify alloster properties gained in oligomers. Alloic interactions were monitored using a FRET-based sensor at the alloster site and pharmacological assays involving mutants to exclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of alloster at the atomic level were examined in molecular simulations. Alloic effects in monomers were exclusively negative, derived from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthost ligands. Allo effects oligomers could be positive or negative, depending on alloster-orth pair, and arose from interactions within and between constituent protomers. The behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

The M2 muscarinic receptor has been understood in terms of interactions within a monomer, but this view disregards the tendency of GPCs to form oligomers. The oligomeric nature of M2 is evident in multiphas effects of alloic lig on dissociation of orthost antagonists and binding equilibrium. To understand how oligomer might account for alloster behavior in terms of mon, positive and negative alloster modulators were compared for effects on oligomers and monomers of M2. The M2 musinic has been a prototype for effects within broader GPC family. Studies of interaction alloic with alloic have been based on modulation of events at orthost, typically in native or detergent-solized receptors. Events may be measured directly, in binding radiol antagonist.

Alloic were examined in dynamics at atomic, starting crystal monomeric M occupied by agonist ipxo. Lig and proteins were removed, conformations sampled within 30ns.
A study investigated the role of SET2, a histone methyltransferase that trimethylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3me3K36), in the DNA damage response to double-strand breaks (DSBs). The research found that SET2 is necessary for the activation of ATM, a protein kinase that responds to DNA damage, and for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. SET2-deficient clear cell carcinoma cells displayed impaired DNA signaling, but failed to activate p53, a protein that guards the genome, and showed decreased survival after DNA damage. The study proposes a novel role for SET2 in chromatin bookmarking that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In clear cell carcinoma, loss of SET2 may provide a mechanism for inactivation of the p53 checkpoint without additional mutations in TP53.

The study used reporter assays to show that SET2 is necessary for the DNA damage response and depletion of SET2 impairs ATM activation and delays 53BP1 recruitment to DSB. Data reveal that SET2 is required for RAD51 recruitment to resect DNA ends and SET2-depleted cells show reduced homology repair DSB. SET2 mutations were found in several cancers, including clear cell carcinoma. Additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanistic basis of SET2 impact on DDR. Unlike histone modifications that promote DDR, this study shows no evidence of H3me3 levels at damage sites or DDR-dependent SET2 recruitment DSB.
Researchers have identified a new genetic mutation, RasgrpAna, in the Ras1 gene, which codes for a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, in mice. This mutation leads to the accumulation of CD44+ Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cells and the production of antinuclear autoantibodies. Despite reduced Ras1-Ras-ER activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in Ras1Ana mice is mostly normal, but CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell autonomous manner. CD44 expression is identified as a reporter of mTOR kinase signaling through a novel strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function in mTOR. Elevated mTOR signaling in Ras1 naïve CD+ cells CD44, CD+ T subset and autoib returned to normal in Ras1Mino double-mut mice, demonstrating increased m activity is essential for Ras1 cell dysregulation.

The Ras1Ana mutation is distinct from previously described mutations Ras1, Zap or Lat, as it has no effect on thymocyte development in mice with normal T repertoire, but results in accumulation of Hel+ PD+ T cells and antinuclear autoib. In contrast to Ras1 deletion, RasAna increases mTOR signaling in naïve CD+ cells. The study reveals a new role for Ras in cell-intrinsic regulation of CD+ T cells, dissociating this function from its known role in thic selection. Biochemical and genetic studies identify overactive m signaling in naïve CD cells as key for RasAna to abnormalities: (1) constitutive increase in CD expression naïve CD T and (2) accumulation of peripheral Hel+ CD44 CD cells autoib.

Genetic reduction of m function in RasAna mice normalizes CD expression naïve CD+ cells and abolishes excessive effector cells and autoib, demonstrating central role for increased activity in immune dysregulation RasAna mice.
Researchers investigated the role of Arida, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation. They used a mouse model with inducible and reversible suppression of Arida in the pancreas in the presence of oncogenic KrasG12 and found that Arida cooperates with Kras in the pancreas to silence Arida following KrasG12 expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PD precursor lesions. In contrast, Arida silencing during embryogenesis with Kras12 activation leads to retention of acinar fate. These results demonstrate Arida as a critical modulator of K-dependent acinar cell identity and highlight the influence of timing and genetic context on SW/S complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis. Suppression of Arida in adult acinar cells with oncogenic K mutations accelerates acinar to ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous cancer lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Arida expression, suggesting Arida provides a barrier to K-driven acinar duct metaplas and early neoplas. Alcian blue staining confirmed retention of mucinous lesions in Ar1-restored mice. Arida loss enables non-reversible reprogramming of fate dependent on cellular and genetic context. The mechanism of Arida regulation of pancreas identity was investigated by perturbing the SW/S chrom-remodeling complex, expected to impact SW/S target genes. Transcriptional and chromatin data imply Arida disruption in oncogenic K reduces chromatin accessibility of TFs to enhancers needed sustain acinar fate. The ability of Arida to stabilize ac identity acts as barrier to pancreatic initiation, other factors necessary promote Pan-to-PDAC transition.
Researchers investigated how social isolation affects the brain's response to stress in mice. They found that isolating pre-adolescent female mice from their littermates for 24 hours changed the properties of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PV) that release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), a key player in the stress response to stress. Specifically, isolated females showed increased first spike latency (F) and decreased excitability of CRH neurons, whereas age-matched males did not. In contrast, subjecting either isolated or grouped females to acute physical stress increased F. The increase in F following social or physical stress was blocked by the glucocortic synthesis inhibitor metrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in F resulted in a decrease in excitability of CR neurons. Observations demonstrate that social, but not physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PV CR neurons.

The study found that brief social isolation (24 hours) affects the biophysical properties of PV CR neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion, with increased F and decreased excitability in socially-isolated females, but not age-matched males. Acute physical stress increased F in group-housed females and single-housed males. Social occluded the effects of swim on female mice. Hypothalamic brain slices were prepared to examine synaptic and intrinsic properties of CR neurons in the PV. Activation of these cells is obligatory for the neuroendocrine response to stress. The study hypothesized that females, but not males, may interpret social isolation as stress. Subjecting single-housed males to acute stress should increase F. In females, prior isolation should occlude the effects of acute. To test, single-housed and females were subjected to swim for 20 minutes and properties of CR neurons assessed. Findings demonstrate males and females react differently to some, but not all stressors. Social has C-dependent effects on CR in females, but not males. Both show indistinguishable responses to physical stress. Prior social occludes effects on F in females, but not males.
Researchers have studied the evolution and function of hemoglobin (H) in mammals to understand how it adapts to different body sizes and oxygen needs. Hemoglobin is a protein that carries oxygen in the blood, and its ability to bind oxygen affects how oxygen is delivered to tissues. While its affinity for oxygen was thought to be the main adaptation, this study suggests that both affinity and cooperativity (how it binds oxygen) are adapted to optimize oxygen delivery. The study analyzed the relationship between cooperativity and affinity, and found that mammalian hemoglobin values lie on a curve that allows for fine-tuning of oxygen delivery to meet different tissue needs. This reveals the mechanism behind body size adaptation of hemoglobin in mammals. 

The study found that hemoglobin in small animals with high metabolic rates has lower affinity for oxygen than in larger animals, showing adaptation to meet oxygen needs. However, results support that changes in hemoglobin binding and conformation have evolved to give maximum cooperativity in oxygen binding, with different values in each case. Examining human hemoglobin, higher metabolic rate was linked to higher cooperativity and lower affinity. A correlation was also found between metabolic rate and hemoglobin affinity.
Researchers conducted a longitudinal analysis of Plasmodium sporite motility in the dermis to understand how the parasite locates and enters blood vessels after being injected into the skin by an Anopheles mosquito. Using intravital microscopy in mice, they found that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: 'vascular motility' characterized by high speed and less confinement in areas far from blood vessels, and 'pervascular motility' with constrained movement near blood vessels. The curvature of sporite tracks optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Mutations in key adhesive proteins highlighted the importance of sporite gliding speed and modulating adhesive properties for successful exit from inoculation.

The study quantified sporite motility over 2 hours after intradermal inoculation and identified altered motility in proximity to blood vessels. CSN and TR-VAL sporites were rendered fluorescent to study surface protein function in dermal motility and blood recognition. CSN sporites spent more time engaging vessels but failed to enter circulation, while TR- sporites had decreased gliding speed, reducing tissue explored volume and vessel encounter.

Sporite gliding is essential for infectivity. Previous reports observed sporite motility in dermis, but not analyzed over time. Intrital imaging sporites first 120 minutes post-inoculation showed significant changes in motility. Data suggest sporites change in response to environmental signals and exhibit two motility types: 'vascular' with high speed and confinement, and 'vascular with constrained movement near blood. This study refines understanding sporite navigation through dermis. Mutant sporites with altered motility or speed decreased blood invasion and infectivity, indicating exit inoculation presents barrier for sporite intervention.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary adaptation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells after the removal of the polarity gene BEM1, which is crucial for cell polarization. Initially, the bem1∆ lineages showed a rapid increase in fitness, followed by a slow recovery to >90% of the fitness of their BEM ancestors after 100 generations. Genome sequencing and monitoring revealed a common evolutionary trajectory with a series of adaptive mutations, each improving polarization by inactivating proteins. The results suggest that organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiological perturbations and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to divergence in cell biologically important functions.

The study followed the adaptation to the removal of an important component of the module that polarizes yeast cells. Cells recovered by a reproducible evolutionary trajectory, largely explained by interactions amongst mutated genes, leading to substantial recovery in speed and accuracy of polarization. The loss of 88 genes in Saccharomy cerevisiae from an ancestor 100 million years ago, and recruitment of new functions by adaptations altering existing and creating de novo genes were observed. The experiment created a set of rapid polarizing mechanisms. bem1 cells often contained more than one polarity site, suggesting positive feedback ensuring a single site polarization is weaker.

Three adaptive mutations re-established efficient polarization. Deleting BEM was chosen due to its relatively young component in polarity establishment and different role in ancestral fungi. This deletion revealed alternative, more evolutionarily ancient modules. B1 is an important polarity gene. The results demonstrate multiple regulation allowing cells to polarize rapidly and adapt to strong perturbations. Under selective pressure, larger mutations inactivating proteins favored evolutionary trajectories removing components over quantitatively altering properties.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanisms of economic decision-making in the medial prefrontal cortex by having participants make successive choices between goods or gambles with lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. They found that the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) encoded value when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encoded value when participants rejected or accepted a prospect. ACC signals reflected two biases: deferring to later and weighing losses more heavily than gains, paradoxically maximizing reward in the task. These findings provide insights into pressures shaping economic decisions and value computation in the medialfrontal cortex.

The study built on previous research examining neural mechanisms of behavior with independent gambles or consumer choices (Daw et al, 2006; Plass et al,2007; Lim et,2013). The task involved committing to an asset with financial consequences. The aim was to understand computational mechanisms of commitments and their neural implementation in medialfrontal cortex. Commitments follow deliberation, items considered final acceptance or rejection deferred (Shir and Tky,199;Sh,201;King et,201). However, unknown whether value coding depends on stimuli accepted or rejected, choosing between options preferred or dispreferred. Unknown how encoding medialfront cortex depends on economic or not.

The study investigated mechanisms accompanying commitment, acceptance, rejection, and deferral in a multi-altern choice with financial ramifications. Participants chose between accepting or deferring a prospect. The dorsal culate (ACC) encoded when prospect excluded, while rmFC encoded during deferral. Joint data and ACC allowed pinpointing two pressures: deferring later and weighing unfavourable options.
Researchers have investigated the role of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies that form around long non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, in controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by retaining mRNA in the 3'-UTR inverted repeats of Al sequences (IRu). In pituitary cells, components of parasck, including major proteins and Neat, displayed a circadian pattern. Insertion of IRu at the 3'-R of EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic nuclear retention of egfp mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted, whereas insertion of antisense IRu had a weak effect. Using real-time microscopy, IRu drove circadian expression of EGFP. This study shows that parasck, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian expression at post-transcription level. Parasck retention of IRu in 3-Rs of genes provides an additional layer of regulation by sequestering mRNAs within the nucleus. Two components of parasck, NON and SFP, display circadian pattern in primary pituitary cells and ratuitary cell line GH1. Circadian genes showed loss of rhythmic pattern when parasck were disrupted, suggesting parasck retention plays role in circadian expression. Post-transcription circadian regulation plays major role in determining oscillations at mRNA level. Given paras functions in expression through mRNA retention and circadian pattern, parasck may rhythmically retain RN in nucleus leading to rhythmic gene expression.
Researchers have identified a protein called Munc13 that plays a crucial role in controlling the function of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) at the nerve terminals of neurons. These channels are essential for converting electrical signals into chemical signals that transmit information between neurons. The study found that M13 interacts with VGCC through a specific site on its C2 domain, and that this interaction affects the channels' behavior during various forms of activity. When M13 was removed or replaced with a mutant, the channels' response to high-frequency bursts of action potentials and calcium influx from single stimuli were altered. This demonstrates a novel form of synaptic modulation and suggests that M13 can significantly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling vesicle priming and exocytosis.

The presence of M13 has a significant influence on VG function, indicating a new mechanism for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The dependence of exocyt on Ca+ influx and control of VG function on fast timescales implies that synaptic can be controlled by VG-active protein interactions. Many presynaptic proteins interact with VGs, but this study provides evidence that M13 interacts with VG in a way controlling calcium dependence on millisecond to second scales at terminals. A critical site on M13's C2 domain was pinpointed, which is orthogonal to membrane-interacting loops.

M13 enhances Ca+ influx and modulates kinetic properties of VG across stimulation conditions, with implications for understanding transmission control. Data suggest modulation is mediated by direct VG-M13 interaction, though cannot exclude interaction with other proteins influencing VG. To test significance, M13-VG interaction, the impact of removing M13 on action-driven calcium influx was examined. Expression of shRNA targeting M13 led to 94% depletion, blocking exytosis. VG failed to reactivate in 1.2mM extracellular Ca WT but not M13R/AA, suggesting increased exyt during 2 ISI pulses M13/AA is direct lack M-VG effect, not secondary exyt. This site M13 C domain mediates VG reactivation terminals.
Researchers have investigated the puzzle-shaped cells found in the epidermis of various plant species, specifically the epidermal cells of leaves and cotyledons, to understand their functional significance. They propose that these complex shapes emerge as a strategy to mitigate mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epidermis of leaves and cotyledons. The team analyzed 3D pressurized cells and found that shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell wall. When epidermal cells become large in two directions, stress is greatly increased. To avoid excessive stress in isotropically growing tissues, puzzle-shaped cells with lobes and indentations provide a solution. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing stress in a mechanical model of the cotyled epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana, where growth is strongly anisotropic and cells can elongate. However, isodetric organs such as broad leaves, cotyled, and fruit cannot elongate. Puzzle-shaped epider cells in isodetric organs prevent large areas in cells and high stresses they induce. The correspondence between fruit and puzzle-shaped epider cells fits the prediction that shapes are required for isotrop growing tissues but not elongated organs. The model predicts cells regulate shape to prevent LEC, a proxy for stress, from becoming too large. A new function for puzzle shape is proposed as an adaptation to mechanical forces on turg plant cells in epider. Mechanically, cells are small inflated with turg pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis cells, reaching up to 50 in stomata.
Human genes contain multiple introns, which require mechanisms to define exons and ensure proper connection by spliceosomes. Spliceosome assembly involves cross-intron and crosson interactions, but how they work together is unclear. Researchers examined human nuclear extracts interactions of single pre-mRNA with fluorescently tagged spliceosomal complexes to investigate cross-in and crosson processes promoting pre-splice assembly. U1 sub bound to 5' splice of intron acts with U bound to 5' of next intr to increase rate and efficiency of U2 recruitment to 3' of upstream intr. Flanking 5 sites have greater effects implying distinct mechanisms U recruitment. Synergy of 5 sites introns and exons promotes correct and efficient splicing of multi-in preRNAs.

The study suggests ordered pre-splice assembly pathway in human, U association with ATP requires prior U binding, unlike branched pathway in S. cerevisiae. Multi-in preRNAs internal exons have 5S upstream and downstream, or both can bind U and recruit U to 3. Two U could act independently or synergistically. Dynamics of U binding to 5 are unaffected by presence U sites downstream or upstream of 5. Prelices can form multi-in preRN through two pathways: intr recognized via cross-in leading to catalytic splice, or via crosson where exons first defined, then cross-in between adjacent ex lead to assembly.
A novel ubiquitin-dependent folding system has been discovered that operates on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to assist in the folding of membrane proteins. This system involves the ubiquitination of a specific lysine residue on the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6, which allows it to interact with a ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaper, providing the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP is transported out of the ER, a step favored by palmitlation. If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubitination of other lysine residues takes over and targets LRP to ER-associated degradation (ERAD). This ubiquitin-dependent folding system also controls the proteostasis of other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and anthrax receptor 2, which are involved in severe human diseases. The system is reminiscent of the glucylation-deglucylation occurring in the ER during the calnexinreticulin folding cycle.
Researchers investigated sex differences in learning and decision-making processes in mice using a classic value-based decision task, the restless two-armed bandit. While male and female mice showed similar accuracy, they achieved this performance through different patterns of exploration. Males made more exploratory choices overall, but got stuck in exploration once started, whereas females explored less but learned quickly during exploration. These results suggest sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration periods more than during stable choices. Exploration is altered in individuals with addiction, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing exploration as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

A study examined sex differences in exploration, training male and female mice on an explore/exploit task, a restless-armed band. Males showed higher exploration than females throughout the task. Computational tools characterized sex differences in latent variables underlying behavior to understand sex in a cognitive process regulating reward-guided behaviors: exploration and exploitation. In an uncertain world, balance exploiting options when available and exploring alternatives could be more rewarding or provide information about the world.

Results of HMM and RL models revealed sex differences exploration, paralleled by differences in learning rate. The interaction of explore-exploit, reward, and outcomes influence animals' choices is unclear. Mechanisms biasing approaches during tasks are significant contributors to performance. A combination of modeling characterized sex differences in explore/exploit. While males and females had performance, used different strategies to learn the environment.

Post-hoc win-lose analyses found females more win-st behaviors, indicating more likely to repeat behaviors produced reward on previous trial.
Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is a process where proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. The cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 drives extraction by pulling polyubiquitinated substrates. However, the mechanism of how hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytos, often with hydrophil and folded ERinal parts, is unclear. Researchers used a reconstuted system with purified from Saccharomy cerevisiae to investigate this process. They found that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (Te-4/MARCH in animals) is a retrolocase that facilitates membrane extraction. The substrate's TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Do10 and passively moves into the aqueous phase. Luminal segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, with unfolding occurring on the luminal side by cytoplasmic C48 action. This reveals how a membrane-bound retroase cooperates with C48 in protein extraction.
In Drosophila, Hedgehog (H) proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Dophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to transcription repressors and activating full Ci or Gli proteins. Researchers investigated the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent H signaling in Dophila wing discs using Ci variants expressed at physiological levels. Results showed that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded gene activation and development of adults with normal morphology when supplemented with constitutive Ci repressor, indicating H can signal in the absence of regulated processing. Processing-resistant Ci variants were also activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos2, likely through binding the CORD of Ci or PK, revealing inhibitory roles of these components in addition to their established roles promoting processing.

Hh signaling guides development and maintains tissue homeostasis in invertebrates and vertebrates. Abnormal H production, distribution, and responses cause developmental defects and cancer, including holoprosencephaly, limb abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and basal carcinoma. Processing-resistant Ci variants supported development adults normal wing patterning with constitutive Ci repressor present to suppress ectopic dpp in anterior cells. Ci mediates normal H morph action in discs absence regulated processing.

In third instar Dila wing discs, H expressed posterior cells and Ci anterior, H signals band anterior-posterior (AP) border declining posterior-anterior. Results show wing patter H not require regulation repressor or full Ci protein processing. Animals lacking Fu and Su develop normal wings, late instar discs lack En induction.
Researchers used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate interneurons in the spinal cord's dorsal horn that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR). They found that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain excitatory signaling, directly relaying signals to lamina projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine-sensitive, caused conditioned aversion, and enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodin-mediated inhibition of interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. These results suggest that dorsal circuits involving excitatory CR neurons are important for pain generation and amplification, identifying interneurons as a potential analgesic target.

The study confirms that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal network contributing to spinal signaling and amplifying pain in the absence of peripheral input. The interconnectivity of this chemically-defined population in the horn positions them to alter sensory information prior to relay to higher centers. This is demonstrated in nocif responses elicited by photostimulation. The work has focused on characterizing CR circuits and their roles in sensory experience by experimental activation using optogen. Future work must determine how circuits respond to peripherally-evoked processing, using halorin.

The study extends the view of excit interneurons in sensory, ascribing a limited role linking low-threshold modality (innocuous) to excite dorsal circuitry. Current models place CR in polysynaptic signals through SOM to activate lamina and initiate pain. Data is compatible with this model since CR-Ch2 photostimulation evoked oSC in horn neurons, including superficial.
Researchers investigated the role of Ras-associated protein 23 (RAB23) in skull development, as mutations in the gene cause Carpenter Syndrome, characterized by developmental abnormalities including polydactyly and skull morphogenesis defects. They generated R23-deficient mice that survived to embryonic day 18.5, allowing study of skeletal development. Similar to Carpenter patients, mice exhibited polyactly and craniosynoses due to aberrant osteoprogen proliferation and osteogenesis in sutures. FGF-driven FGFR1 signaling was elevated in R23-sutures, leading to MAPK, Hedgehog, and RUN2 expression imbalance. Inhibition of pER1/2 signaling normalized osteop proliferation and reduced osteogenic expression, preventing craniosynosis. The study suggests R23 as an upstream regulator of FGFR and canonical H-GL1 signaling, and non-canonical GL1 through p1/2.

R23 deficient mice showed upregulation of Pit2, F10, and Fb expression, decreased p38 and enhancedER1-RUN2 signaling, and osteop proliferation. R23 regulates sutural cell marker GL1, represses H, and inhibits osteop expansion. R23 also repress F-driven p1 signaling, affecting osteop development, RUN2 differentiation, and repressing GL1. R23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating F-1-R2 activity, and GL1 activation. R23 controls suture morph and patency through three mechanisms: F10-1 signaling, repression H targets canonical pathway, and GL1 repression by1. GL1 regulates mesenchymal cell niche F10-1 and H-1 signaling osteop proliferation.
Researchers investigated how Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains epigenetic repression of genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. They monitored the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target FLOW LOCUS C (FLC) in the same plants, showing one can be repressed while the other is active, and this mixed state is inherited through cell divisions as plants develop. This demonstrates epigenetic memory of FL expression is stored in cis, not trans, meaning the chromatin environment of a gene instructs its own epigen inheritance.

The study used the epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure, mediated by cold-induced epigen repression of the Poly target and floral repressor FLC. Vernal has been observed in imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Imprinting involves DNA methylation and X-chromosome inactivation involves changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning. The question remains whether Poly-repressed chromatin at a gene can store epigen memory.

Epigenetic memory can be stored in concentrations of diffusible factors or locally in chromatin of individual genes. The study developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FL expression at single-cell level and returned to question cis vs epigen at FL. They crossed F-merry to F-Venus to generate hybrids carrying single of each trans. In trans memory, possible heritable states are ON/ON and OFF/OFF because epigen stored as diffible. F repression requires P2 but is independent DNA methylation, making a system for studying cis capability of Poly at single.

Vernal plants FL is bistable, with cells repressed increasing quantitatively with duration prior exposure. The study demonstrates that Poly-repressed chromatin at single gene can instruct its epigen inheritance, constituting a cis system.
Researchers have investigated the physiological modulation of BiP activity by trans-protomer engagement of the interdomain linker in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Hsp70 chaper. They used site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking to probe the architecture of oligomers formed by ER Hsp70 and found that they consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain of one molecule in the substrate site of another, attenuating chaper function of oligomeric Bi. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly modulated reciprocal relationship between burden of unfolded proteins and Bi oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified Bi. Lumen ER depletion caused rapid oligization of mammalian Bi and coincidental diminution in substrate, pointing to relative inertness of oligomers. Equilibrium between inactive oligomers and active monomeric Bi is poised to buffer fluctuations ER protein load on rapid timescale neither interconversion active coval-modified Bi nor conventional protein response.

Bi oligization is tuned to physiological state of cell, given oligomer inactivating Bi protomers, olig form relatively inactive chaper accessible short timescale.

Researchers have determined the near-atomic structure of Pepino virus (PepMV), a representative of the Potexvirus genus, at 3.9 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals the fold of the coat protein (CP) and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus genus, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses. The main difference between Potv CP and Phlev NP is their C-terminal extensions, which determine distinct multimer assemblies. A homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic (+) and ssRNA viruses.

The study found structural homology between CP of flexuous viruses and NPs of Phleviruses, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses. NPs are associated with viral genome in ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) inside envelope, with glycoprote construct icosahedral shell. Flexible filamentous viruses are plant pathogens with significant impact on agriculture. Their particles are non-enveloped, rod-shaped virions with hundreds of CP in helical arrangement protecting +ssRNA.

High-resolution structures of flexuous plant viruses correspond to Potvirus family, including current and previous structures of PapMV and BaMV. It is unclear if other flex families (Beta, Closter, Pot) have similar CP fold. The structure of PepMV CP and NP from RVV are depicted in similar orientations, with respective ssRNAs colored. Both proteins have similar topology when C-terminal removed, with C-termini shown for comparison. Both Potv CP and Phv NPs bind and protect genomic ssRNA.
Researchers have developed a new method, called Site, for imaging-based localization of molecular binding sites on cell surfaces with nanometer resolution. This is achieved by estimating the distance between a bound ligand and a reference point on the cell surface using topological averaging. Traditional methods for epitope identification are costly, time-consuming, and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. The new method is well-suited for antibody binding measurements on native cell morphology and can be applied to other molecular estimations. Fast and efficient screening of epitope locations is useful for therapeutic monoclonal antibody and vaccine development. Cellular morphology varies, and antibodies bind heterogeneously across the surface, making traditional particle-averaging strategies challenging for accurate antibody localization.

The method uses high-resolution images to calculate the average distance between a ligand and reference, achieving nan-scale precision in one dimension. This is done by reducing surface data within an image plane. The method is exemplified on antibody-coated bacteria and agrees with previously reported data. The location of binding is determined by calculating the average distance between ligand and reference using fluorescent signal along cell contour. The method can estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical surfaces. Site measurements for ligands on bacterial protein agree with reported data. The Fc binding site on protein is located at region and non-specific monoclonal IgG is used for localization.
Researchers have investigated the role of peripheral resistance in the regulation of systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates, focusing on the relationship between hypoxic response in tissues and cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation. They found that hypoxic response in the skin, mediated by HIF transcription factors, influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice, affecting heart rate, arterial pressure, and body temperature. The study demonstrates a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in peripheral tissues in modifying cardiovascular response to hypoxia.

Peripheral resistance, specifically in the skin, plays a crucial role in systemic response to hypoxia. Analysis of skin as a model tissue with a substantial vascular bed revealed that loss of hypox-responsive genes affects cardiovascular response to hypox. HIF-1α, H-2, NOS, and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis showed significant changes in blood pressure and temperature in mice lacking these genes compared to littermate controls.

The study shows that keratinocyte H-1 and H-2 expression affects acute and chronic phases of cardiovascular response to hypox. Hypox increases sympathetic tone in skin to increase peripheral resistance. A proposed model of hypoxic response involves H isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in skin, where hypox results in H-α/NOS/NO increase in diameter and perfusion, followed by H-2/Argase reduction of intracellular L-argin.
Researchers have developed a refined optogenetic method for mapping neural circuit connectivity with single-neuron resolution by combining two-photon excitation with targeted expression of channelrhodinopsin (ChR) to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. This approach enables the reliable activation of individual neurons, verification of action potential generation with GCaMPs, and determination of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. The method overcomes limitations of previous optogen methods, which often resulted in unintended activation of fibers or axonal boutons due to temporal focusing of two-photon excitation. By restricting ChR expression to the soma and proximal dendrites, researchers can selectively target individual neurons and avoid confounding light-induced responses from dendritic and axonal fields, which can extend up to 200µm around the soma. This technique allows for precise evaluation of synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution, essential for understanding neural circuit function and behavior.
Researchers have re-examined the interaction between two transcription factors (TFs), Sox2 and Oct4, on eukaryotic genomes using single-molecule data. Contrary to previous findings suggesting ordered assembly, the data indicate that Sox and Oct exhibit negative reciprocity, with Sox increasing Oct's genomic binding while decreasing Oct's Sox binding. A biophysical analysis reveals that this reciprocity can arise from energy expenditure or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. This implies unexpected complexity in how TFs interact with DNA, which single-molecule methods can detect.

The sign of reciprocity differs from ordered assembly, with Sox and Oct sometimes helping and hindering each other across the genome. This was an unexpected finding, as TFs like Sox and Oct typically exhibit cooperativity at different loci. However, single-m data provide novel capabilities for unraveling mechanisms. The analysis suggests the possibility of energy expenditure in Sox and Oct's action on DNA, a concept not previously found in living cells.

The variation in cooperativity across the genome has significant ramifications, indicating that single-m data, coupled with experimental strategy, provides more information than expected. A single value, Γ=-0.22, suggests Sox and Oct exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across loci in vivo. The genomic-divers model proposes either energy expenditure or mixed cooperativity, with Sox and Oct helping each other at some loci and hindering at others.
Researchers have discovered that fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) exhibit aversive responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are immune system cues that signal the presence of infection. The study found that gustatory neurons expressing the Gr66 receptor mediate avoidance of L in feeding and egg-laying assays, and that the expression of the chemosensory channel TRPA1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. Furthermore, L stimulates Drosila neurons in a TR1-dependent manner and activates exogenous TR1 channels in human cells. This demonstrates that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism.

The study shows that L is avoided during feeding and oviposition, and TR1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. Data indicate a TR-dependent mechanism of L avoidance may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infection. Flies, but not TR1 mutants, preferred laying eggs on control food rather than on contaminated with E. coli. coli. TR1 mediates acute responses to L in mice and avoidance of bitter compounds in flies. Researchers tested whether TR1 mediates gustatory of L in flies. Blocking transmission in neurons by tetanus toxin abolished L avoidance, indicating flies detect L through gustatory mechanism.

TR1-dependent avoidance of L in Drosila melanogaster. Preference index of control and TR1 deficient male flies for control over L-supplemented food. It is conceivable L activates TR channels via same mechanism, additional experiments required verify. Data demonstrate flies possess gustatory underlying detection and avoidance L. Avoidance of L-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may prevent Gram bacterial infections, compensating lack immunity in animals. Sensory exploits TR1 suggests conserved principle channels crucial L detection sensory neurons flies and mammals, regardless modality involved.
Researchers have identified a zinc finger protein called Zfp335 as essential for the formation of naïve T cells, a type of immune cell critical for immune function. A mouse mutant, Zfpbl/bl, with a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp, exhibits a deficiency in naïve T cells due to a developmental defect starting in the thymus and continuing into the periphery, affecting cells that have recently exited the thym. The effects of Zfp are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thym selection, proliferation, or B2-dependent survival. Zfp binds to promoter regions with a consensus motif, and its targets are enriched in categories related to metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring expression of one target, An2, partially rescues cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp as a transcription factor and regulator of late-stage intrathym and post-thym cell maturation.
Researchers have challenged the long-held assumption that mRNA abundance directly correlates with protein abundance in bacteria and archaea, finding that the two are often imperfectly correlated. This discrepancy can be attributed to two factors: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. A new factor, mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, was identified, which increases translational efficiency and demonstrates a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:RNA interactions across prokaryotes, having a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or cod usage. Synonymously variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:RNA interactions showed that GFP levels correlate with avoidance, enabling precise modulation of protein abundance.

A global analysis of 97% of species found reduced capacity for mRNA:RNA interactions relative to controls. Variant GFP mRNAs with varying interaction potential were generated, demonstrating expression can be predicted and controlled. Results show strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA:RNA across proaryotes, a property called "intrinsic avoidance". However, this approach may fail to identify genuine cases with extreme G+C content differences between RNAs. Measuring intrinsic using shuffled mRN as controls, mRNA:RNA interactions were significantly underrepresented in 73% of proary phyla (p<0.05). A signature of selection minimizing mRNA:RNA interactions was established, but complete avoidance is combinatorially unlikely due to thousands of interacting species in simple proary systems. A trade-off between avoidance and optimal expression is predicted.

Avoidance is as good an explanation of protein variation as cod usage and mRNA structure. Results indicate cros between mRNAs and ncRN impact protein levels, enabling design of constructs with controlled expression. A meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data showed correlation between mRNA and mRNA:RNA avoidance, predicting mRN with low avoidance produce fewer proteins per transcript than high avoidance.
In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), researchers used in vivo imaging to study the dynamics of motor unit (MU) and neuromuscular junction (NM) degeneration over a three-month period. They found that motor units are dismantled asynchronously, with axonal branches being dismantled prior to complete axonal degeneration, accompanied by contemporaneous axonal sprouting and synapse formation onto nearby NMs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first NM, suggesting a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. This indicates that NM denervation in ALS is a complex process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of global motor neuron degeneration.

The study reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NM in an animal model of ALS, highlighting a temporal window between branch-specific dismantling and motor axonal degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited. However, rescue of neuronal loss in SOD mice does not necessarily improve NM denervation, suggesting local-specific events may play a role in NM denervation. Local alterations of synaptic and molecular function occur early at NM in ALS, and longitudinal in vivo imaging of motor axonal arbors and NMs directly assessed the time and dynamics of structural changes during progression.

The study predicts a MU-dependent mechanism would result in synchronous degeneration of the MU over a brief period, while a contribution of neuromus changes result in asynchronous loss of NMs within a MU. NM denervation occurs before significant axonal or cell loss, and whether it arises from branch-specific degeneration or manifestation of diseased globally degenerating neuron remains ill-defined.
Researchers investigated the effects of tamoxifen, a medication used to treat breast cancer, on mice to understand its side effects on the body. Tamoxifen improves survival in breast cancer patients but causes long-term side effects such as hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. The study found that mice treated with tamifen experience changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed tamifen induces gene changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-PO). These changes depend on estrogen receptor alpha (ER) as conditional knockout of ER in the hypothalam-PO ablates or reverses tamifen gene expression. ER-deficient mice do not exhibit tamifen changes in temperature, bone, or movement. The study provides insight into tamifen effects on the hypothalam-PO and that ER mediates several physiological effects of tamifen in mice. 

Tamifen expression in the hypothalam-PO is necessary for tamifen changes in gene expression in hypothalam- and effects thermoregulation, bone, movement. Findings suggest tam treatment modulates ER signaling in the nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of health. ER mediates many aspects of physiology and ER conditional knockout transcript effects tamifen. Body temperature, movement, and density were measured in ER mice treated with tamifen and wild-type animals. ER primarily regulates physical activity in mice. Tamifen acts as ER antagonist in estrogen-sensitive regions to suppress activity in mice. Tamifen has profound effects on bone remodeling. The study defines cell and mechanisms mediate undesirable effects of tam therapy. Tam administration in mice increases dissipation, decreases movement, and bone density. Studies reveal effects tam treatment on hypothalam- and implicate ER signaling as major of tam effects thermg, movement, homeasis.
ISG15, an interferon-stimulated, diubiquitin-like protein with antiviral activity, plays a previously uncharacterized role during bacterial infection. Research reveals that IS15 expression in nonphocytic cells is dramatically induced upon Listeria monocytogenes infection. This induction is independent of type I interferon and depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA signals through STING, TBK, IRF3, and IR7. Importantly, IS15 restricts Lister infection in vitro and in vivo. Stable isotope labeling in culture (SILAC) identifies ISylated proteins responsible for the protective effect. Overexpression of IS15 leads to ISylation of ER and Golgi proteins, correlating with increased secretion of cytokines counteracting infection. Data reveal IS15-dependent restriction of Lister infection, reinforcing IS as a key component of innate response.

In nonphocytic cells, IS15 is induced upon Lister infection, with early induction independent of type interferon. Lister-mediated IS induction depends on the cytosolic pathway, sensing bacterial DNA through STING, TBK, IR3, and IR7. IS15 counteracts Lister infection in vitro and in vivo. ISylation of ER and Golgi proteins increases secretion of cytokines counteracting infection in vivo. Results show IS15 can be induced by Lister in interfer-independent manner in human nonocytic cells, determining IS induction and consequences on cell and infection.

Phenotype mirrors bacterial burden of IS15/ MEFs, indicating IS role in defense against Lister requires ISylation. IS is a ubiquitin modifier covalently linked to cellular and viral substrates. Two transcripts are conitantly induced after 3 hours of Lister infection. Conitant induction suggests IS could be induced interfer-independent during Lister. To test, used viral BR to block interfer receptor signaling.
Researchers have developed DeepRET, an automated software for analyzing single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smRET) data using deep learning. smRET is a method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the growth of high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of rapid, standardized, automated analysis methods for the produced data. DeepRET is an open-source, standalone solution based on deep learning, requiring only human intervention from raw images to histograms of biomolecule behavior is user-adjustable threshold. It integrates standard smRET features, outputting common kinetic metrics. On ground truth data, DeepRET accuracy reached >95%, outperforming human operators and commonly used threshold, requiring ~1% time. Its rapid operation on data demonstrates DeepRET capacity to quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking smRET for structural biology.

DeepRET uses a pre-trained neural network for rapid, objective, accurate assessment of smRET data. The software operates with minimal human intervention, requiring threshold on data quality as an initial step to detailed quantification from images. It comes as a free, executable for Windows and Mac users, allowing end-users with limited skills to operate. Deep-based analysis recognizes patterns, learns features from raw data, allowing implementation routines without extensive preprocessing or empirically rules, reproducible evaluation single-molecule. It is faster human for large-datasets, coming close.

The classification was achieved without preprocessing or post-inspection, illustrating Deep power to operate without interventions and potential benchmark reproducibility smRET methods multiple laboratories. A confusion matrix quantified the discord between truth and classified by DeepRET (Figure 3). DeepRET was trained on simulated or high-annotated data (Wang et al, 2019). We expect similar approaches to be a paradigm shift, enabling fully automated methodologies biomolecular recognition, folding, dynamics, resolution. Advances are paramount increasing breadth single-m studies in structural biology.
The study investigates the role of SCML2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, a Polycomb protein that associates with Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCMLA, an isoform of SC2 tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to PR1 localization and repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SC2 binds PR1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). Targeting SC2 to chrom involves coordinated action of MB domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PR1 through SPM. Deletion of BR reduces occupancy of SC2 at target genes and overexpression of mutant SC2 lacking BR causes defects in PR1 recruitment.

 SC2 appears to enforce repression at a subset of genes independent of PR1 via mechanisms to be elucidated. Identification of SC2 as Pc protein that binds and contributes repression of Poly targets sheds light on interplay between ncRN and epigen regulation and combinator factors that drive specificity of Pc complexes in different contexts. Results show RNA also plays role in SC2 function, required for localization to chrom. In Dophila, interaction SCM and PR relies C-terminal SPM (Peterson et al, 2004) conserved in humans.

Data support model in which BR contributes localization of SC2 to chrom, interacts PR and creates chrom environment refractory to transcription. SCM Pc protein binds at least Pc target Dila (Wang et al. Identified novel BR in SC2 contributes chrom localization with recognition of methylines by MB domain, RNA activity BR required to recruit or stabilize SC on chrom. Proposed SC2 retained target genes through interaction PR, contributes stabilizing PR. Experiments conclude SC recruited subset through process requires RNA activity and presence mutant SC2BR not chrom-bound causes release BMI, presumably PR from chrom.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of ribosome stalling by SecM, a peptide that regulates the Sec-dependent secretion pathway in E. coli. coli. They used cryo-EM structures of Sec-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution to reveal two distinct stalling mechanisms at different elongation steps of the translation cycle. One mechanism is the inactivation of the ribosomal peptid-transfer center, inhibiting peptide bond formation with proly-tRNA. The other is prolonged pept-RNA residence at the A site, inhibiting full tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate control of the translation cycle by regulatory peptides through dynamic reshaping of the ribosomal center.

To understand Sec-dependent stalling, researchers purified Sec-stalled ribosome nascent complexes using in vitro translation from E. coli and analyzed using single cryo-EM. Their analysis of rib-Sec interactions at atomic level revealed two mechanisms of stalling and details how Sec peptide modulates translation in steps. Previous studies showed ribosomes stalled through different ways, including antibiotics.

Structural analysis of Sec-stalled ribosomes near-atomic reveals interactions between Sec and the tunnel induce conformation changes of 23 rRNA nucleotides U5, U6, and A2, locking the PTC in inactive state. Two forms of stalled ribosomes, post-state and rotated, indicate interactions between Sec and tunnel induce conformation changes P, leading to translation arrest at elong steps, peptide-bond and tRNA trans. The tRNAas peptide of Sec-tRNA is similar to active rib with PTC. Comparison with states capable of peptide-b formation provides alternative Sec-induced stalling Sec-G-R.
Researchers used an Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscope to image cones at the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects and measured cone density and other metrics in units of visual and linear retinal units. The fove cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove, but not proportionally to eye length. Despite retinal stretching, myopes have higher angular density and around the fove compared to emmetropes, offering potential for better acuity. Reports of deficits in best-correct fove vision in myopes compared to emrop cannot be explained by increased between photoreceptors caused by ret stretching during my progression.

The study aimed to investigate the effect of eye length on cone density at the fove center. Two types of densities were discussed: angular and linear. Studies found myopes have higher fove photore sampling with potential for better performance compared to emrop. The simplest explanation for deficits in myopes increased separation caused by stretching would be ruled out. Adaptive optics offers highest images of the fove photore mosaic ever recorded in vivo. Despite advances, previous studies investigating packing and length did not make measurements at the center, the most region for vision but difficult to image due to small size.

The enlargement of the image matched stretching the mosaic, eyes would sample the field similarly. In fact, large myopes attain good ac with correction. The study found myopes have higher angular density around the fove compared to emrop, offering potential for better acuity.
Researchers have developed a model to calculate the duration of pneumocococcal carriage in the nasopharynx from longitudinal swab data and combined it with whole genome sequence data. They found that pneumoccal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the variation in carriage duration, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The heritability was partitioned into lineage and locus effects, with serotype contributing 17%, drug resistance 9%, and other locus 7%. A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and antibiotic resistance.

The study aimed to identify genetic determinants of pneumoccal carriage beyond serotype, which was previously unknown. Longitudinal data and whole sequence data were combined to quantify and map genetic contribution to carriage of S. pneumoniae. Herit analysis showed variants other than ser affect carriage, consistent with recent work (Leinen et al, 2017), and identified candidates for loci fulfilling this role. These studies suggest variants in pneumcal genome alter carriage, linked to antibiotic resistance. The pneum genome sequence explained most variability (63%), with ser and erythromycin resistance causing 19%, and prophage presence/absence 7%.

Significant sources of variation in carriage were identified, with transmission pairs sharing duration and differences between/within serotypes. Prophage effect on duration has implications for pneumoc genome diversification through frequent loss during carriage episodes. The study suggests genetics of S pneumonia is a factor in determining duration in this population. Environmental conditions, such as host status, may affect herit estimate.
Researchers have investigated the stoichiometry of the slow rectifier (IK) channel, a crucial for cardiac repolarization, composed of the tetrameric voltage-gated channel KCQ1 and its β-subunit KC1. Studies have reported either a strict 2:4 or variable up to 4:4 stoichiometry. To clarify this, IK fusion proteins linking KC1 to one, two, or four KC1 subunits were created to reproduce 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed that linking two or four KC1 subunits resulted in hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to one, abolished by KC1 addition. Using unnatural amino acid crosslinking, KC1, crosslink rates to two or four subunits were slowed compared to one, demonstrating no intrinsic limit to four-subunit association within the IK complex. This suggests flexibility in KC1 association allows modulation of repolarization through changes in expression. The delayed rect current IK, conducted by KC1 and KC1, stabilizes repolarization and shortens action potential duration at high heart rates. Altering stoichi may change channel composition, shifting overall kinetics. Other β-subunits, KC1-5, can be expressed in cardiomyocytes. This study aimed to clarify stoichi using fusion channels with KC1 linked to one, two, or four KC1. Complexes were evaluated in mammalian cells with or with additional KC1 sub using whole-cell, single recordings and unnatural amino approaches.
Researchers have investigated the role of interleukin-1 beta (Ilb) in the regeneration of zebraf fin tissue after injury. They found that Ilb is produced by myoid cells, but also by epithelial cells in response to injury, initiating an inflammatory response. Macrophages are necessary for survival of regenerative cells and resolution of inflammation. Ilb regulates expression of regeneration-induced genes. The study shows Ilb and inflammation act as a double-edged sword, required for regeneration but impairing it in excess. Macrophages attenuate Ilb expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration. Data suggest excessive Ilb and inflammation cause apoptosis in mutants. Myoid cells are essential for survival of regenerative cells. Macrophages play a role in tissue patterning and growth, but their function was unknown. This study elucidated their role in attenuating Ilb expression and inflammation. Ilb is provided by epithelial in response to injury, and prolonged Ilb action causes apoptosis. Macroph are responsible for Ilb attenuation and inflammation resolution. Normal Ilb and inflammation are necessary for regeneration to activate regeneration genes. Data support excessive Ilb and inflammation cause apoptosis in mutants. Ilb plays a role in normal regeneration by activating regeneration genes. Proper Ilb and inflammation, tuned by macroph, are necessary for tissue progression.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the properties of ribosomes and the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome in prokaryotic cells. They used surface-modified fluorescent proteins (F) to measure the translational diffusion coefficients (D) in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloaxii. The results showed that in E. coli, the diffusion depends on the net charge and distribution of the protein, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect was weaker in L. lactis and H.ii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility was caused by interaction of positive F with ribosomes, confirmed in vivo and in vitro with purified ribosomes. Ribosome properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasm proteome.

In L. lact and H.ii, the slowdown in diffusion with increasing surface charge was less pronounced due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in coefficient was mainly caused by binding of positive to ribosomes, with KD on the order of µM, indicating non-selective interactions. Ribosome properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasm prote.

The diffusion coefficients of proteins in E coli cytoplasm depend on net charge and distribution over protein surface, with positive moving up to 100 slower. Diffusion became slower when cells exposed to osmotic shift. In L lact and H, proteins not only diffused slowly, but binding to ribosomes also inhibited synthesis, affecting assembly or activity. 18 ribosomal proteins in E coli have net charge more+10. If GFP findings transferable to ribosomal, these proteins experienced diffusion drop more than 5.

To analyze consequences, proteomes of E, L, L, H, and four endosymbiotic bacteria were analyzed. (i) how protein diffused given proteome composition, knowing net charges and abundances all components; (ii) how ribosomes affected diffusion constituents, knowing net proteins. Many biological processes depend on interactions macromolecules and translational diffusion, especially in proary due absence active cytoplasm transport. Macromolecules need diffuse cells function.
Researchers have identified a protein called S-follatin that plays a crucial role in the regeneration of planarians, a type of flatworm that can regrow its body parts. They found that Sollatin inhibits a signaling pathway called Activin, which is involved in tissue growth and development. When planarians experience injuries that result in the loss of tissue, Soll is expressed at high levels and blocks Activin signaling, allowing regeneration to occur. However, when injuries do not result in tissue loss, Soll is not expressed and regeneration does not occur. Two other proteins, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are required for Soll to function. The study suggests that Soll inhibits Activin to trigger regeneration specifically in response to injuries involving tissue loss, providing a key mechanism for regeneration across the animal kingdom.
Researchers have identified a unique genetic signature in tumors with a deficiency in mismatch repair (MMR) that distinguishes them from other tumors but shares similarities with germline DNA, indicating that a significant portion of human genetic variation arises from mutations that escape MMR. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing confirmed the MMR-deficient signature and revealed a large set of recurrent indels that may detect microsatellite instability (MSI). In endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, a novel marker was optimized to detect MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard tests. Recurrent indels were enriched in the DNA-strand break homologous recombination pathway, leading to reduced DSB repair in M-deficient tumors, making them sensitive to DSB inducers.
Researchers have engineered an optimized version of a light-inducible dimer protein called Magnets, derived from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid, to enable precise and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive fashion. Magnets are small modules that consist of two components, nMag and pMag, which are well-tolerated as fusion partners and photorequire simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling spatiemporal confinement of dimer with single excitation. However, Magn require concatization for efficient responses and preincubation at 28°C to be functional. To overcome these limitations, an optimized Magn pair, eags, was engineered requiring neither concatization nor low preubation. eags were validated using to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, induce organel contacts, and reconstitute OS-VAP-ERol tether implicated in phosphidyositol-4-phosphate transport metabolism. eags represent an effective tool to optogen manipulate physiological processes whole or subcell volumes.

The Magn pair was engineered from Vivodimer by introducing complementary charges, giving nMag (negative) and pMag (positive). The Magn components are small (150aa) photodizers, exhibit fast association and dissociation kinetics, and function fused to a range of proteins, including peripheral and intrinsic. The reagents, eags, have greater stability and dimer efficiency as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics. Their effectiveness was confirmed in various applications, including protein recruitment to different organel, generation of organel sites, and rapid reconstitution of V-dependent organel teth with key functions lipid transport.
Researchers have investigated the signaling pathways triggered by ribosome stalling during translation in neurons, which has been linked to neurodegeneration. They used a mouse model with a mutation in the Gbp2 gene, leading to stalled elongation complexes at AG codons, and found increased phosphorylation of eIFα (Ser51) and activation of ATF, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway, prior to neurodegeneration. The ISR was activated by GC2, an eIFα kinase, in a tRNA-independent manner. Genetic experiments showed GC2 attenuated neurodegeneration in the mutant mice, highlighting the importance of cellular context in the outcome of this pathway. The study demonstrates a link between elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during stress.

 Ribosome stalling activates GC2, a previously unknown mechanism linking elong and initiation of translation. Failure to resolve elong complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration, but the pathways triggered by these complexes were unknown. GC2 activates ISR in the brain of mice with stalled ribosomes, showing a feedback between elong defects, stalling, and initiation. In the hippocampus of mutant mice lacking GC2, degeneration of CA pyramidal cells was observed, suggesting the eα/ATF pathway is vital for survival during stalling. ATF also occurs in mice with no unprocessed tRNA, raising the possibility stalling contributes to GC2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation. The mechanism of GC2 activation by stalling remains unclear.
Over the past century, adult height has changed unevenly across the world's countries, with no indication of convergence. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was approximately 19 cm for men and 20 cm for women a century ago, and remained the same for women, but increased for men, despite changes in country rankings. The largest gains in height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (17.5-22.7) and 16.5 (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, little change in height was observed in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The tallest men were born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, averaging 182.5 cm, while the shortest were born in Guatemala in 1896, 140.3 (135.8-144.8) cm. Women were taller than 158 cm in Norway, Iceland, USA, and American Samoa, while the shortest were in El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, Korea, and Japan. The tallest populations a century ago lived in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and Pacific islands. Men born in Sweden and USA surpassed 171 cm, 18 cm taller than in Laos, while Swedish women averaged 160.3 (158.2-162). Men born in 199 surpassed 181 in Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, and Denmark, with Dutch men at 182.5 (180.6-184.5), the tallest. The gap with shortest countries Timor, Yemen, and Laos, men only 160 tall, increased 4 cm on the global in 189 birth.
Opioid-induced respiratory depression is a major contributor to the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States, with rates quadrupling between 1999 and 2017 to 130 deaths per day. To address this issue, researchers investigated the brain areas and cell types mediating opioid-induced respiratory depression. They found two key sites in the brainstem, specifically the preBtzinger Complex, where breathing originates, and used genetic tools to reveal 70-140 neurons in this region are sensitive to opioids. Characterization of these neurons may lead to therapies preventing respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

 Studies showed Opr1 glutamatergic preöt neurons mediate this effect, with 70 glutateric neurons sufficient to rescue opioid depression of preöt rhythm. Given the importance of Db1 neurons in rhythm generation, it's hypothesized opioids act by silencing presynaptic release, removing these neurons from network. Alternatively, a subset preöt excitatory neurons may generate inspiratory rhythm, with Opr1 enriched in this subgroup.

Opr1 is expressed in central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites modulating breathing such as cerebral, brainstem control, motor, solitary nucleus, and sensing afferents. Among two sites studied, one is dominant, driven by 140 neurons in vitro, not required for opioid-induced analgesia, a potential target for safer strategies. Deleting µpi receptor from both sites eliminates OIRD, even high doses fentanyl, suggesting targeting these sites rescues respiratory depression. Remaining opioid effect may be due incomplete transduction but cannot rule minor sites.
Researchers have identified sodium taurochotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as a functional receptor for human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus, hepatitis D (HDV). HBV and HDV infections remain a significant public health concern, with individuals co-infected with HDV experiencing more severe disease. The entry of both viruses into cells is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S domain of the large protein, which is a key determinant for receptor binding. However, the identity of the receptor was unknown. Using near-distance photo-crosslinking and affinity purification, researchers revealed that the pre-S binding region interacts with NT, a transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NT inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NT expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatarcinoma cells susceptible to viral infections. Replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NT with human counterpart conferred ability to support both viral infections. The study demonstrates NT is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections and promoting long-term immunity. Research has shown that individuals who survive seps can enter a state of chronic immunoparalysis, characterized by lymphopenia and functional deficits in surviving cells, making them more susceptible to re-infection. This study investigated the impact of seps on pre-existing memory CD8 cells, which provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine production following reencounter with cognate antigen, and found that they proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Using a mouse model of seps, researchers demonstrated that this proliferation is associated with recovery of pathogen-specific memory CD8 cells following seps-induced lymphopenia, leading to changes in the composition and localization of the memory CD8 cell compartment. Memory CD8 cells from seps survivors have an altered transcription profile and chromatin accessibility, indicating long-lasting cell changes. These changes result in altered cell function and reduced capacity to control L monocogen infection, suggesting seps leads to long-term alterations in CD8 cell phenotype, function, and localization, and host response to refection.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism by which the APOB3A3 enzyme inhibits LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition, a process that poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes. APO3 is a cytidine deaminase that converts cytosine to uridine in single-strand DNA substrates. In cultured cell assays, A3 is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retroposition. However, previous studies did not detect deamination in L retroposition events generated in the presence of A3. To elucidate the mechanism, researchers used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that A3 inhibits L retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA during L integration. This provides a mechanistic explanation for how A3 cyine deaminase inhibits L retroposition. In vitro assays, engineered L1 retroposition from cells co-expressing A3 and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI) showed strand-specific A3-mediated C-to-U deamination. These data indicate A3 inhibits L retro by deamin transiently exposed single-strand during L integration. Previous studies showed overexpression of wild-type APO3 cyine deaminase (A) inhibited L retro in cultured cells, but deamination was not detected in L events generated with A. The mechanism of WT3 inhibition remained unclear. An in vitro L Element Amplification Protocol (LEAP) recapitulated the first cDNA synthesis of L integration to elucidate A3 inhibition. Degradation of deamin retrointermediates reduced L levels in cell assays, potentially eliminating A-mediated events in resultant L sequences.
Researchers investigated the role of the activity-regulated non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity, a process by which sensory experience shapes neural connections and properties. They found that mice lacking Rem2 exhibit impaired ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, Rem2 regulates intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings showed increased firing rates in the absence of Rem2. The study demonstrates Rem's key role in regulating excitability and function in the context of changing sensory experience.

Rem2 functions at the nexus of a network sensing and responding to changes in activity to preserve circuit function in the face of experience. It may regulate responsiveness of the cortex to stimulation through excitability or synaptic scaling. To understand mechanisms underlying OD plasticity deficits in Rem- mice, the authors examined adult plasticity. Rem's role as a regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at morphological, cellular, and circuit levels connects molecular regulators of morphology with broader function.

Rem's expression is acutely regulated by visual experience, so its role in activity-dependent processes in the cortex following sensory deprivation was investigated by ocular dominance plasticity. Rem is a candidate to link neural activity with plasticity, a member of the Rad/Rem/Gem/K family, regulated by activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated channels.
An analysis of the effects of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells has been prompted by recent reports of magnetism in biological systems. Studies have identified a protein that acts as a compass to guide magnetic orientation in animals (Qin et al., 2016) and magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel and tugging it with a magnetic field (Stanley et al., 201; Wheeler et al., 2016). However, the author argues that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, with discrepancies of 5-10 log units. If the phenomena occur, they must have causes different from proposed by authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein limits their utility for magnetically sensitive cells.

The forces or torques and temperatures produced are too small by many orders of magnitude for desired effects on orientation or membrane channels. If occurred as described, must rely on different mechanism. Barring new discoveries of biological structure, proposed magnetetics based on pulling or heating ferritin complex with fields have no chance of success. A molecular system was designed to couple magnetic to ionic current across membrane, consisting of putative mechano-sensitive channel (TR4) fused to intracellular ferritin subunits. Experimental results suggest neural activity modulated by static fields, but evidence is scant and hard to interpret. Ferritin is a large complex with 24 subunits forming spherical shell 12 nm diameter.
Researchers have studied the process of quiescence in Drosila neural progenitor cells, also known as neuroblasts, to understand how they switch between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence. They found that the factor Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus before entering quies, followed by a unique molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation markers. A low level of Prosper precedes entry into quies, even when timing is advanced or delayed by changing identity factors. Loss of Prosper prevents quies, while a pulse of low Prosper drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quies. The study proposes that Prosper levels distinguish progenitor states: absent self-renew, low quies, and high differentiation.

The researchers used Drosila neurobl as a model to study conserved pathways regulating stem cell proliferation and quies. They found that nearly all quies neurobl at 12 hours after induction reactivated and expressed progenitor markers. Precocious low Prosper advanced the timing of NB-3 quies. Transient low Prosper is sufficient to induce neuroblast quies. A correlation was found between Prosper timing and neuroblast entry quies, with Prosper occurring earlier in mutants and later in mutants. Loss of Prosper delayed the timing of neuroblast quies. A pulse of Prosper precisely matched the timing of neuroblast quies, occurring earlier in mutants and later in mutants. This suggests a functional relationship between Prosper and neuroblast quies.
Researchers have developed a single-molecule microscopy method to study the kinetics of HIV-1 capsid unco, a tightly regulated disassembly process required for viral DNA release. The study reveals that opening the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step, followed by rapid collapse. Capsid inhibitor PF74 accelerates opening but stabilizes the lattice, while polylysine binding to a conserved arginine cluster delays initiation but does not prevent disassembly. Observations suggest different stages of unco can be controlled by interplay between capsid regulators, determining overall kinetics.

A single-particle fluorescence microscopy was used to follow real-time unco of authentic HIVids after membrane permeabilization, observing effects of capsid molecules on discrete steps in unco process. Traditional ensemble measurements would have obscured order of events due to averaging. Capsid molecules exhibit differential effects on initiation and continuation of unco, with structural heterogeneity described in assembly yielding conical, tubular shapes and defective lattices.

The assay resolves intermediates in disassembly averaged in ensemble measurements, classifying individual caps according to unating behaviors. Characteristics of HIV-1 unco and interactions with capsid molecules were observed: (1) caps population integrity is heterogeneous, majority contain defects/uncoat after membrane removal; (2) in absence binders, unco is all-or-none, rapid after first defect created; (3) half-life sufficient for P-permeabilized particles to quantify labeled protein binding to authentic caps at single level.
Researchers have investigated the role of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in breast cancer development and found that its loss-of-function mutations are frequent in breast cancer genomes. Contrary to expectations, JNK signaling promotes cell proliferation by activating the AP-1 transcription factor, its association with tumor development was unexpected. In a murine breast epithelium, loss of J signaling caused genomic instability and cancer development, and J deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a breast cancer model. This suppressive function was not mediated by J's role in tumor growth, but by its requirement to prevent initiation. Data identify J pathway defects as driver mutations promoting instability and initiation.

Loss of J signaling in mammary epithelial cells caused breast cancer, and accelerated tumor formation in a murine breast model. Effects of J deficiency to promote development were associated with neoplas and genomic instability. J plays a key role in initiation of tumor development. The significance of J pathway inactivation in cancer is unclear, but loss promotes murine breast development and accelerates tumor in a model. Frequent J loss-function mutations in human cancer may represent driver mutations promoting development. J loss plays a role at early stages of cancer by promoting mammary neoplas, accounting for effect of mutational inactivation to promote development.

The J pathway may be suppressed in many cancers. Association of cancer with reduced signaling is a correlation. The purpose was to test role J in development. J causes AP transcription activation, anticipated to promote growth.
Researchers have identified a crucial enzyme called peptidylglyc α-amating monxygenase (PAM) that plays a key role in the formation of cilia in various cell types, including Chlamydomonas and mammals. The study found that P is necessary for the assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamdomonas and mice. Chydomonas P knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia components. Decreased P gene expression resulted in reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface of planaria and the appearance of cytoplasmic axemes lacking ciliary membrane. Primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in P-/- mouse embryos were also aberrant. The research suggests that P activity and post-Gol trafficking contribute to cili defects and reveals a conserved link between P amidation and cilium assembly. P is required for biogenesis of motilia in C. reinii and ventral epithelium planaria, as well as primaryilia neuroepith cells in mammals. It plays a conserved role in early cili steps, linking amidation and cilium in multiple types. P may be included in proteins trafficked to ciliary from Golgi in ancestral eukote. Results indicate amid and membrane roles of P contribute cili.
Myosin III (My3) and actin bundling protein Espin play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, and defects in these proteins cause hereditary hearing impairments. My3 interacts with Espin through its tail homology motif (TH), but it is unclear how My3 specifically acts through Espin to regulate actin assembly and stabilization. This study reveals that My3TH contains two repeat sequences capable of independently binding Espin's ankyrin repeats, an unexpected My3-mediated crossing mechanism of Espin. The My3-Espin complex structures elucidate the binding mechanism and reveal My3-induced Espin autoinhibition release. My3 crossing also promotes Espin's actin bundling activity.

My3 binding releases Esp's autoinhibition and increases Esp-promoted actin bundle diameter (Zheng et al, 2014). Mya and Myb co-localize with Espin at stereilia hair tips (Merritt et al,201; Sal et al,200; Schneider et,200). Co-expression of Mya and Espin stimulates stereilia elongation in cultured Corti hair cells (Sal et,200). My-Espin interaction likely promotes thicker actin bundle formation in cellular structures such as stereilia.

The TH mediates My binding to cargo Espin and transports Esp to actin-based structures such as filopodia and stereilia. Once localized, Esp WH domain promotes actin elongation (Merr et,201; Sal et,200). However, the molecular basis of My-Espin interaction is unclear. The full-length My-Espin complex has higher actin bundling activity than the My-AR-Espin complex studied here. This study reveals a direct myosin-induced bundling regulation mechanism of actin crosser protein.

Genetic findings point Esp's critical roles in stereilia development and maintenance, promoting parallel actin bundles (Bart,200; Sekova et,200). Mya and Myb contain similar sequences in TH region, each binding Esp-AR with high affinity.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in the functioning of excitable cells, such as neurons and heart and skeletal muscles, by translating membrane depolarization into calcium influx. To achieve diverse functions, these channels activate at different voltages and kinetics. Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms governing voltage sensing properties by combining modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukotic calcium channel Ca1.1. Both SDs displayed features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ion-pair formation of outer charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage dependence, while stabilization of resting slowed kinetics. This provides a mechanistic model explaining how ionair formation in SDs can realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels.

Voltage-gated calcium (Ca) channels translate depolarization into calcium influx, contributing to cellular excitability and coupling electrical activity to functions like contraction, secretion, and gene regulation. With voltageated sodium (Na) channels, Ca form a structurally related superfamily with four symmetry. Advanced models of activated and resting states Ca1.1 VSD fill a gap in understanding voltage sensing in eukotic voltageated channels. Tested interactions suggested by the model showed predicted effects on gating when experimentally tested by mutagen and electrophys analysis. Alterations of properties recognized experimentally were reproduced and explained by computer. Structures of lowest states Ca.1 VSD display features of sliding helix.

Researchers used Rosetta modeling to build a homology of human eukotic Ca1, based on cry-EM of Ca1 (Wu et al, 2016; Wu et al,201). However, resting states eotic and Na channels remained inaccessible to structure determination. Experimental and modeling support the helix of voltage action (Catter et al,201; Yarovarovoy et,201).
Researchers investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in visual plasticity in the adult brain, particularly in the context of stroke recovery and learning. They found that optimal levels of MMP activity are crucial for visual plasticity to occur in both healthy and stroke-affected brains. In healthy animals, a 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented plasticity, while treatment with MMP-inhib once after stroke, but not twice, rescued plasticity normally lost under these conditions. The study highlights a critical role of MMPs in adult plasticity and suggests that upregulation of MMP-activity shortly after cortical lesion compromises visual plasticity, which can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMPactivity is essential for plasticity in the adult brain, offering opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke.
Researchers have used cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of AMPA (α-amino-3-hydro-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors, a type of glutamate-gated ion channel found at vertebrate excitatory synapses. These receptors consist of four subunits that assemble as dimer-dimers and undergo rapid activation and desensitization during signal transduction. The study used bifunctional methaniosulfate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations of AMP receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargin. The results indicate that the extracellular layer of AMP receptors can get trapped in stable, opened conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, Stargin limits this conformation flexibility. Under synaptic conditions, where glutamate and auxiliary proteins are present, the extracellular domains of AMP receptors likely stay compact during gating. The study suggests that extracellular domains of synaptic AMP receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during transmission and instead work in a compact conformation regime, unless exposed to long glutamate in pathological conditions.
Researchers have developed a new method to isolate and analyze immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with helmin, a type of parasitic worm, which has been challenging due to the strong immune response it triggers. They optimized a digestion protocol to isolate millions of immune cells from the infected duodenum, the first part of the small intestine, and used high-dimensional flow cytometry to analyze them. This allowed them to identify hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the course of helmin infection and has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses that were previously unfeasible.

To validate the protocol, they used a 23-color flow cytometry panel to characterize the cells, incorporating surface and intracellular markers associated with helmin infections. The isolation and high-dimensional analysis enabled characterization of innate and adaptive anti-parite responses throughout helmin infection, validated by confocal microscopy. Changes in cell ratios between naïve and infected samples were reported by both approaches. Importantly, many changes were observed locally, highlighting the need for good cell techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helmin directly.

To ensure accuracy, they quantified B220, Sig F, CD, CD, CD, and CD cells using confocal microscopy and compared to flow cytometry data. Difficulties with digestion during helmin infection are associated with anti-parite type 2 response driving mucus production, epithelium alteration, immune cell infiltration, and tissue remodelling. The new protocol provides an accurate representation of intestinal responses, overcoming previous challenges.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand how the proteasome, a complex enzyme responsible for breaking down proteins, works. The proteome's activity varies over time due to interactions between substrates and products and regulatory sites, which are predicted by the model and supported by experiments. The rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of substrates into the proteome, with varying efficiency between standard and immuno-proteomes affecting total degradation and cleavage usage.

A comprehensive model describes regulatory components of 20 proteomes and interactions between substrate transport and hydrolysis over time for representative peptides, combining experimental and computational analyses. Short fluorogenic peptides with a single proteas-catalyzed cleavage site were used to follow kinetics in real-time, observing proteome dynamics over time in purified 20 proteome and homogenates. The model describes core proteome features reflecting proteome dynamics in complex scenarios like cellular environment.

Polyubiquitin tagging and peptide-hydrolysis regulate protein-life affecting majority of cellular processes. Despite biochemical efforts, mechanisms of proteomal action and differences in substrate proteysis between proteome isoforms are incompletely understood. The 20 proteome is dynamic, catalytic activity varying over time influenced by substrates and regulatory sites. Kinetics change longer than structural dynamics, described by Oulski et al (2009).
In Drosophila, the recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission, and histamine is required for visual transmission. Histamine is taken up by laminar glia, converted to carcinine, and delivered to photoreceptors, where it is hydrolyzed to histamine and β-alanine. However, it is unclear how β-alanine is returned to laminar glial cells. A new βanine transporter, Bala, was identified, and null mutants exhibited lower β-al levels and accumulation in the retina. Bala is expressed in retinal pigment cells and required for visual transmission and photaxis. Results suggest retinal cells play a critical role in neurotransmission and a Bala-dependent βanine pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and neurotransmission.

A novel βanine transporter, Bala, functions in retinal cells to recycle βanine. Disrupting histamine and carcinine abolishes photoreceptor transmission. Transport of βanine is less important as it is present in higher concentrations in Dophila. βanine is essential for histamine homeostasis and photore transmission, and maintaining a βanine pool sustains synaptic transmission. Pigment granules, reducing light intensity, are formed in retinal cells of Doph compound eye. High βanine levels in retinal cells suggest cells transport and store βanine in this system.

Mutations in Bala disrupted βanine transport and storage in retina, resulting in reduced photoreceptor activity and behavior. Efficient βanine systems compensate for β loss in hist to carcin conversion. Bala transports and stores βanine in retina, resulting in reduced photore activity and behavior. This suggests conserved βanine trafficking in mammals and Doph. Our work, with previous reports, provides a complete histamine pathway for sustaining photore transmission. In this pathway, carcin is synthesized epithelial in optic lamina, transported to photore via synaptic cleft.
Researchers have investigated the role of oxidants in the aging process of yeast cells, specifically Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and found that chronological aging cells undergo a sudden collapse in redox homeostasis, resulting in the oxidation of nearly 80% of thiol-containing proteins. Contrary to the free radical theory of aging, this collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, but rather a substantial decrease in NAD+ levels, which normally provides electrons for cellular redox balance. This decrease in NAD levels occurs early in lifespan and initiates a cascade that downregulates cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NAD levels and delays each facet of the cascade. The study reveals a timeline of events leading to widespread oxidation of the proteome before cell death.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of proofreading during translation of the genetic code, which is essential for maintaining homirality in the biological macromolecular world. They studied the enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacyase (DTD) from Plasmodium falcum, which removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of DTD in complex with a substrate-mim analog revealed how it uses an invariant cross-subunit Glyis dipeptide to capture the chiral center of D-amacyl-tRNA. No protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, but the unique side-independent substrate recognition explains DTD's ability to act on multiple D-am acids. This strict chiral specificity ensures the enriched pool of L-amacy-tRNAs escapes the proofreading step. The study provides insights into a fundamental enantio process and elucidates a chiral mechanism crucial in preventing D-am acid infiltration during translation apparatus.

The researchers used a side-free mechanism to recognize how nature designed a deacyase to deal with D-tRNA, highlighting the role of weak bonds in chirality selection. If L-aa binds in the pocket, it would do so in one of three possible conformations. The study provides a fundamental enantive mechanism in enforcing homir in proteins by decoupling D-as tRNAs. Earlier studies on DTD provided a mechanistic model based on docking or structures with ligands not mimicking the cognate substrate. DTD removes D-am acids mischarged tRN to prevent D incorporation into proteins, acting as a freanding module by recapturing aa-tRN from EFu.

The amino recognition site captures atoms attached to the chiral C and crossunit interactions, particularly Glyis motif from monomers. The amino moiety interacts with residues from both monomers. In the substrate, D would be linked to tRNA, multiple binding is improbable due to fixed orientation and position by terminal adenos.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of opening and closing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel, a chloride channel mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. They found that the opening of the pore is strictly coupled to the dimerization of the two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), even in the absence of ATP. This contradicts the previous understanding that ATP is required for pore opening. Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but occur in certain mutants and are the only mechanism stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CF potentiator. The researchers correlated energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with pore opening/closure in single CF channels. They show that spontaneous openings are also coupled to N dimer, which may occur without coordinated NBD/pore movements. This suggests that CF alters the stability, not the structural architecture of open and closed conformations. This explains effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF and drug mechanisms. 

The researchers propose that ATP acts as a "molecular glue" to stabilize the transition and open state, rather than altering the arrangement of conformations. They found that the pore is likely closed in the high-energy transition state for spontaneous openings. The study constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent gating and driving forces, conserved among ABC proteins, and explains modulatory effects of mutations or regulators. The ligand site is occluded in open channels, so open-state binding cannot be defined. Disruption of hydrolysis forces CF channels to gate, following a linear sequence rather than a cycle. Low-probability ATP-independent openings of a CF construct lacking N2 can be linked to N dimer, but the results argue that remaining N-T machinery undergoes similar movements to dimer when truncated.
Researchers have proposed a new mechanism for the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, which they refer to as the "pre-transition" or "orderobic" effect. This phenomenon occurs when a protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase is embedded in an ordered bilayer, stabilizing a microscopic order-disorder interface. The stiffness of this interface is finite, and when two such proteins approach each other, assembly reduces the interfacial energy. This effect is analogous to the hydrophobic effect and is mediated by proximity to the order-disorder transition and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.

Using large-scale molecular simulations, the researchers found that a transmembrane protein with a hydrophobic thickness of approximately 2.6nm favors the disordered phase, while a larger protein can melt the ordered phase near the protein and form an order-dis interface. The prediction of enhanced lipid mobility around proteins may be testable by single molecule techniques. Biological membranes and transmem proteins are more complex than the models, with multiple components allowing for more than one order-dis transition, and a dual orderobic effect where a protein in the disordered phase favors the ordered can nucleate an order-dis interface.
Researchers investigated the relationship between action potentials (APs) and fluorescence signals in genetically encoded calcium indicators, specifically GCaMP6 and GCa6f, in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of the primary visual cortex in vivo. They used simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice to characterize the AP-fluorescence transfer function. Under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under typical population imaging conditions, only a minority of 1 and 2 AP events were detected (<10% and ~20, respectively). This highlights the limits of detection under realistic imaging conditions.

To construct AP-calc fluorescence curves, isolated events were identified and separated by ≥100 and ≥500 ms for GCa6, and ≥300 for GC6. Only a minority of APs were used to construct curves, with APs summed over 250ms. The study facilitates interpretation of existing and future imaging studies using mainstream transgenic lines, such as the Allen's Brain Observatory dataset. Previous studies established most AP detection with GC6 under near-optimal conditions.

The performance of several spike models was tested, detecting AP under optimal and less optimal conditions. Results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence, aiding interpretation of existing and future imaging datasets. Genetically encoded indicators are widely used with two-photon microscopy to report activity in vivo, enabling measurement of hundreds or thousands of neurons at single resolution over sessions.
Researchers have discovered a unique biological valve in the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave-dwelling insect Neotla, which enables it to receive multiple seminal packages from the same or different males during copulation. This valve is composed of two sclerites, a closure element, and in- and out canals, and allows females to anchor the male's penis-like intromitt organ and receive voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, which is formed by seminal injection and not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve has two slots for insemination, enabling Neotla to mate while one slot is occupied, in conjunction with the penis, this valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation and multiple seminal injections.

 Studies show that Neotla females use a mechanism to control the direction of seminal flow, actively. The biological valve allows to receive two packages (nutrition) from the same or different males within a short span. In particular, the valve receives a seminal while the first is consumed. With the valve, Neotla can use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other empty. This enables females to receive an additional package from the same or males using the empty slot. The presence of spermathe plate with valve to control seminal flow may refine understanding of causes and consequences of reversed selection in genus. Female-female competition for males (sex reversal) to receive nutritious substances is considered most factor driving evolution of female penis.
Researchers have investigated the role of Munc-18 in the assembly of SNARE proteins, which are crucial for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. They used optical tweezers to observe four stages of SNARE assembly: N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD) domains. Mutations in differentially affected SN assembly and exocyt, with NT and CTD responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while MD regulates assembly and fusion. M-18 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes the half-zipped SN complex, independent of syntaxin's N-terminal domain. In the absence of M-18, SNAP-25 dissociated from tethered syntaxin and VAMP, but in its presence, 45% of unfolded SN complexes reassembled. M-18 held SNAP-25 with tethered syntax or VAMP as SN unfolded, facilitating de novo assembly. Three M-18 activities were observed: enhancing de novo assembly, stabilizing half-zipped SN, and regulating interactions between SNs and membranes. Combining results, a model was proposed for M-18's roles in stage SN zippering and membrane fusion.
Researchers investigated how integrin adhesomes, the protein complexes that facilitate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, assemble at focal adhesion sites on the cell surface. They used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and recovery after photobleaching to study the dynamics of integrin adh components and their exchange between adhesion sites and the cytosol. The results showed that integrin adh is preassembled in the cyol as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites, which are then released symmetrically exchanged with adhesion sites without altering their composition. This ensures uniformity of adhesion sites. The cyol building blocks cannot form larger structures due to protein-protein interactions, but at the plasma membrane, additional interactions induce self-assembly of adhesion sites. The study found that integrh is preassembled in the cyol as multi-protein blocks corresponding to functional layers of adhesion, including anchoring, transduction, and actin regulation. Symmetric exchange between adhesion and cyol satisfies the requirement that blocks enter and exit sites unaltered.
Researchers have identified a new electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal in humans, including sleep and anesthesia. This marker, known as the 1/f slope of the electrophys power spectrum, reflects the non-oscillatory, scale component of neural activity and distinguishes wakefulness from propof anesthesia, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye (REM) sleep. Unlike REM sleep, which is characterized by desynchronized 'wake' electroencephalogram (EEG) activity, NREM and propof anesthesia exhibit synchronized oscillations. The 1/f slope was found to be more negative (power steeper) in sleep and anesthesia compared to wakefulness, and was able to discriminate wake from N and REM sleep based on neurophysiological brain state. This marker was observed in four independent datasets, including intracran and scalp recordings. The 1/f slope was also found to track changes in excitability over the course of slow waves, providing a mechanistic link between the slope and synchrony during oscillations. Additionally, the non-oscill, aperiodic part of power, approximated by 1 decay of power from 30 to 45 Hz, reliably differentiated wake from three states of reduced arousal: REM, N sleep, and propof anesthesia.
Researchers have discovered that stromules, dynamic tubular extensions of chloroplasts, interact with microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AF) to facilitate chloroplast movement during innate immunity. They found that MTs are necessary for stromule extension and stabilization, while AFs provide anchoring points for stromules. Interestingly, the direction of stromules from chloroplasts correlates with the direction of chloroplast movement. Strom-directed chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions, suggesting it's a general function in epidermal cells. The study proposes a model where stromules extend along MTs and attach to AF points, guiding chloroplasts to the nucleus during innate response.

MTs are required for strom extension and movement, depolymerization leads to retraction, and stabilization increases frequency. AFs are not necessary for strom extension but provide anchoring points. The cytoskeleton supports various cellular functions, including cytoplasm streaming, cell division, elongation, growth, vesicle trafficking, and nuclear positioning. This study shows MT-mediated strom extension and AF-anchoring are complementary during strom formation and movement, providing mechanistic insights into interactions with the cytoskeleton and stabilizing stromules. A new type of organellar movement along MT is strom-directed, revealing a mechanism for peruclear clustering during immunity.
Researchers have developed a method to predict residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. They found that amino acid pairs that covary across protein-protein interfaces in 50 ribosomal and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures are almost always in contact, provided the number of aligned sequences is greater than the proteins' length. This method was used to predict subunit contacts for 36 complexes with unknown structures, and models were presented for four complexes: tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate form lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter.

A pseudo-likelihood method was used to predict contacts across protein-interfaces for evolutionarily conserved complexes with unknown structures. In a set of complexes with known structures, covarying pairs were almost always in 3D structures with sufficient aligned sequences. Residue-residue covariance occurred frequently between interacting pairs but rarely between non-interacting, making it useful for predicting protein interactions. This study examined residue-residue covari across protein-protein interfaces using a pseudo-likelihood statistical method, unlike previous global models which were limited to histidine-kin/response regulator system.

Predictions were made for 36 complexes with unknown structures, with at least one prediction having a GREIN score of 0.85 or higher. These predictions contribute to determining structures of biologically important complexes.
Researchers investigated how people categorize visual scenes by gathering information from multiple locations in the scene using a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a categorization task. They found that participants' eye movements follow an active strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of the scene and statistical structure of patterns. Categorization performance improved when locations were revealed by an optimal Bayesian sensor. By combining a Bayesian observer and sensor, they estimated that 70% of apparent optimality in fixation arises from biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements. The process of selecting locations is 70% efficient in the task. Results suggest participants select eye movements to maximize information about categories requiring integration from multiple locations.

The study extends active sensing to tasks with arbitrary features, not spatial, such as categories. It provides the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information under eye movements by matching observer to participants' performance. For the first time, it dissociates eye movement process from percept, motor, and decision processes, and identifies sources of suboptimality in sensing, and quantifies efficiency of each fixation throughout the scene. The approach is applicable to multiple perceptual domains.

To study eye movements quantitatively, they estimated efficiency on a high-level task on fixation-fixation basis. Focusing on pattern categorization, different from search, where a single location has all information, and movements are described by inhibition. Participants' movements were more efficient than heuristic strategies employing a subset of active sensing, and 70% as optimal with participants' prior, perception, noise, and saccadic inaccuracies. Inspired, they designed an experiment with controlled patterns and simple, ensuring foveal vision using a gaze-conting task tracking eye and successively small parts of each location.
Researchers have investigated how large molecules, such as pathogens, mRNAs, and ribosomes, can pass through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) into the nucleus. They found that the size of the molecule and the number of nuclear localization sequences (NLS) on its surface determine how quickly it enters the nucleus. A two-parameter biophysical model was developed to explain this process, showing that import speed is related to the energy required for transport through the NPC. For smaller molecules, biochemical and physical properties of the surface influence transport, but for larger molecules, size and number of Ns are key factors. The model assumes that molecules do not interact with each other during transport, but those with Ns bind to transport receptors can enter quickly. Studies have characterized N-mediated transport with one to five Ns, showing mono-exponential kinetics. The transport machinery can be reconstituted with key components: Importβ, Importα, RanG, NTF, and GTP, validated by control experiments. Nuclear transport is essential for eukaryotic cells, with 200 NPCs in HeLa cells, spanning the envelope.
Researchers have investigated the role of CD28, a co-stimulatory molecule, in helper T cell responses after activation. CD28 is known to be essential for T cell priming and differentiation into effector subsets, but its function after priming was unclear. A strain of mice with CD28 removed from CD4 T cells after priming showed that continued CD28 expression is necessary for effector CD4 T cells following infection. CD28 is required for expansion of Th1 cells and differentiation and maintenance of follicular helper cells during viral infection. Additionally, CD28 is necessary for clearance of Citrobacterium rodent from the gastrointestinal tract. This study demonstrates CD28 persistence is required for helper cell polarization in response to infection, revealing a novel function distinct from its role in priming.
Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium responsible for stomach infections, requires a helical shape to efficiently colonize the stomach. However, the molecular mechanisms generating this shape are unclear. Researchers investigated how H. pylori maintains its diameter while maintaining sidewall curvature. They used metabolic probes to investigate polysaccharide (PG) patterning in H. pyl and found synthesis enhanced at negative and positive Gaussian curvatures using superresolution microscopy and 3D image analysis. Cytoskeletal proteins Mre and Cm were localized, with Mre most abundant at negative curvature and Cm at positive curvature. Strains expressing Cm variants with altered polymerization properties lost helical shape and positive curvatures. The authors propose a model where M and C promote PG synthesis at negative and positive curvatures, respectively, necessary for maintaining helical shape.

To understand H. pyl's diameter control, researchers employed metabolic probes to investigate PG patterning. Synthesis was enhanced at negative and positive curv, and cytoskeletal proteins M and C localized. M promotes PG synthesis at negative curvature due to its preference in H. pyl and role in localizing synthesis in other organisms. To maintain sidew curvature, H pyl augments default pattern with growth at major axis independent of M. pyl uses bafilin C to promote synthesis positive curv on sidew and supplements M-enhanced synthesis at negative cur. This allows H pyl to maintain curv in presence of M-associated synthesis.

In straight-rod E. coli, M is enriched at negative and C at positive curv where synthesis observed. Both M and C help maintain PG activity and pattering plays fundamental role in helical shape. Researchers also investigated if wall super twisting occurs during growth and if PG remains major axis as cell grows. Computational tools showed H pyl achieves broader sidew curvature than curved-rod C. cresus and V. cholera, using distinct mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a new function of the protein Cdc48 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, specifically in the process of mitochondrial fusion. C48 is a ubiquitin-selective chaperone that orchestrates the function of E3 ligases and deubiquilases (DUBs), enzymes that remove ubiquitin from proteins. The study found that C48 integrates the activities of two DUBs, Ubp12 and U2, which have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion. Ubp12 stabilizes pro-fusion ubiqulation on mitofus F1, while U2 facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on F1 inhibiting fusion. C48 synergistically regulates the ubiqulation status of F1, controlling the balance between activation and repression of mitochondrial fusion.

The study reveals a cascade of ubiqulation events involving C48 and two Ds, fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of F1. This ensures tight control of F1 ubiqulation levels, allowing mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiqulation that targets F1 for proteasomal turnover. The cascade between U12 and U2 also revises recent results linking U2 and M30. M30 catalyzes the formation of pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on F1. C48 negatively regulates U12, which negatively regulates U2, explaining the two Ds opposite effects on targets and ubiquostasis.

U12 and U2 cleave different ubiqulated forms F1 that promote or repress mitochondrial fusion, respectively. Given U12 regulates U2, the two ubiqulation pathways are connected. On F1, U12 ubiqulation precedes U2 ubiqulation. Unopposed antiusion, as in Δ2 cells, disrupts mitochondrialulation. U12 recognizes ubiqulated chains F1 composed of few ubiquitin moieties, proposing it does not stabilize substrates due to short ubiquitin chains. U12 and U2 deubiqulate F1 but bind different forms of ubiqulated F1. U12 binds forms that stabilize F and promote fusion, while U2 chains target F for proteomal and inhibit.
Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate how the ventral occipitotemporal (VC) cortex, a region of the brain associated with visual processing, responds to sound in sighted and congenitally blind individuals. The study aimed to determine if visual experience is necessary for the development of categorical organization in VC. Results showed that VC reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind individuals, using a representational structure and connectivity similar to that found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group, with a representational format closer to that found in vision. Crucially, VC in the blind represents categorical membership of sounds rather than acoustic features. 

The study demonstrates that categorical organization similar to vision can emerge in VC without visual experience, and that this response is enhanced in congenally blind individuals. Previous studies have shown that the occipital cortex enhances non-visual processing in absence of vision. By using representational analysis, it was found that membership predicts represent structure of sounds in VC in the blind, rather than lower-level acoustic attributes. 

The study found VC encodes categorical membership of sounds from eight categories in both sight and blind, using topography, represent format, and connectivity similar to observed in vision. However, the representation of auditory stimuli in VC exhibits different nuances compared to organization in sight individuals. The overlap between groups may be due to VC representing visual attributes in sight and acoustic in blind due to crossmodal plasticity. Studies have shown congenally blind occital represent acoustic features, such as frequencies.
Researchers have identified a strain of the fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in the laboratory. Infected flies exhibit moribund behaviors, including climbing upward, extending their proboscis, affixing in place, and raising their wings, creating a path for spores to launch from their abdomens. The fungus invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct mechanism for inducing behavioral changes. A new system is established for studying the fungus-host interaction, leveraging the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster to understand how E. mus manipulates behavior. 

The fungus was isolated and characterized, and its impact on D. melanaster behavior in the lab was studied, presenting the E. mus-D. melanaster system as a model for understanding parasitic manipulation of host behavior. The invasion of the nervous system by E mus grants direct access to neurons, potentially mechanistically important for behavioral manipulation, but alternative explanations should be considered. Four mechanisms by which E mus achieves behavioral manipulation are proposed. To test if E mus can infect hosts outside Drosidae, flies were exposed to E mus-infected D melanaster using a modified protocol, resulting in death and sporulation, indicating infection. Molecular changes in host and fungus were measured over 5 days to understand how E progresses in D melanaster.
Researchers have generated transcriptome-wide binding profiles of 30 RNA degradation factors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to understand RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. The profiles reveal distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes, consistent with the canonical pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling of mRNA half-lives suggests most factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited for degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping preferentially binds mRN with non-optimal codons, consistent with degradation of inefficiently translated mRN. Global analysis suggests nuclear machinery targets aberrant RNAs and processesRNAs.

The study used photoactivatable ribonucleotide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PARCLIP) to generate profiles for 30 degradation factors. Bioinformatics analysis revealed factors vary in binding specificities for classes of RN and locations on transcripts. Comparisons with published profiles other RNA-binding factors showed clusters co-occupy RN or co-localize RN. The study provides a resource for future studies eukotic RNA pathways, mechanisms, and integration metabolism.
Researchers have identified a novel type of chromatin associated with the rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis in response to pathogen signals. Camalex is a potent defense compound in Arabidopsis that can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. While several transcription factors controlling camalex biosynthesis have been characterized, the rapid activation of this pathway upon pathogen signal was unknown. By combining publicly available epigen data with chromatin mapping, researchers found camalex biosynthesis genes marked with epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on expression: trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3me27) repression and acetylation lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3ac) activation. These modifications form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac suggested both modifications required for timing gene expression and metabolite accumulation at early stress stage. The study indicates Hme-Hac bivalent chrom, named kstat, plays a role in controlling timely gene expression upon stress in plants.

The researchers localized Hme and Hac on camalex biosynthesis and functionally examined Hme-Hac bivalent chrom in Arabid. Results suggest Hme-Hac bivalent maintains proper camalex induction upon pathogen. Integrating epigen profiles with genome-wide metabolic Arabid, two epetic marks opposite expression, Hme and Hac, enriched camalex bios and other metabolic pathways. Mutants defective Hme or Hac induction cam biosynthesis and metabol accumulation accelerated or delayed. Results provide evidence defense camalex regulated epetic level. However, other mechanisms regulating camalex may also affect transcription kinetics metabolite accumulation.

The study found Hme and H co-localized camalex bios forming uncharacter bivalent chrom. Examined role H-H bivalent cam biosynthesis combining epomics genetics, biology, and biochemistry.
Researchers have investigated the role of the histone methyltransferase EZ2 (EZH2) in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult subventricular zone (SV) of the mouse brain. They found that Ezh is required for neurogenesis, independent of its role in SV NSC proliferation, as Ink4/Ar-deficiency in Ezh-deleted SVNSCs rescues cell proliferation, but neurogenesis remains defective. Olig2 is a direct target of EZ, and repression of this bHL transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Ezh prevents the activation of genes associated with non-SV neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SV cells including astrocytes also express EZ, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. EZ is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocytes, orchestrating distinct aspects of adult stem cell biology, with implications for regenerative and oncogenesis.

EZH expression is a feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult brain, and is required for distinct functions regulating cell proliferation and neuronal specification. To enable SV NS self-renew, EZ directly represses the Ink/Ar locus. Studies establish EZ as a feature of astrocytes in the postnatal SV of the mouse and human brain, and identify separable roles in producing neurons from a multipotent cell. Results provide insights into the complex role of this Poly repressive factor in development and gliagenesis.

In the human, EZ is expressed in astrocytes and neuronal precursors of the infant SV, suggesting a key role in postnatal neurogenesis. Data indicate EZ a critical epigen determinant for maintaining multipotent astrocytes, enabling proliferation and cell specification of an adult stem population. Results show EZ has a role in SV neurogenesis distinct from its function in InkAr repression, and rescuing only proliferation not differentiation enables investigation of additional roles in neurogenic astrocytes. Reexpression of Ezh rescues neurogenesis in E-de,Ar-null SVNSCs.
Researchers used single-cell genomics to study the relationship between viruses and uncultivated SUP bacteria in a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) ecosystem. They found that approximately one-third of SUP bacteria were infected with viruses, with higher infection rates in areas with severe oxygen deficiency. The study identified 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA and ssDNA viruses, and observed co-infection between ds and ss viruses, suggesting cooperation. Analysis of microbial and viral metagenomes revealed viruses persisted in the OM for years, but remained endemic. Viruses encoded dissimulatory sulfite reductase, suggesting they reprogrammed their host's energy metabolism. The study demonstrated coupled virus-host co-evolution dynamics, potentially modulating biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical OM.
Researchers investigated the role of TTC26/DY13, a putative intraflagellar transport (IFT) protein, in the assembly and maintenance of cilia/flagella. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, they found that TTC26/D13 is an IFT complex protein in mammalian cells and Chlamdomonas reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/D13 in zebraf embryos or mutation of TTC26/D13 in C reinhardt resulted in short cilia with motility defects. Surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed were normal in dy13 mutant flagella, unlike other IFT complex mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicated a specific set of proteins involved in motility were depleted in dy13 mutant. These results support the concept that different IFT proteins are responsible for different subsets of cargo, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of IFT machinery.

TTC26/D13 is not required for ciliogenesis per se, but plays a specific role in transporting a subset of ciliary proteins involved in motility. Comparative proteomic analysis of flagellar proteins in dy13 mutant supports this function. In contrast, IFT56 is conserved in most ciliated organisms, suggesting a conserved role in cilia/flag IFT. Knockdown of I56 in zraf embryos and C reinhardt dy13 cells showed motility defects cilia/flag. Unlike other I proteins, TTC/D13 is not required for assembly or movement of I particle, but transports specific motility-related proteins into ciliaflag.
Researchers have investigated the role of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) in the metastasis of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. They found that when melanoma cells interact with LEC, it leads to the activation of matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14), Notch, and β-integrin in the melanoma cells, resulting in an invasive sprouting phenotype. This interaction increases the ability of melanoma cells to metastasize to distant organs in a mouse model. The study used a combination of 2D and 3D co-culture models of melanoma and LEC, mouse tumor transcriptome profiling, in vitro studies, and zebraf xenograft metastasis to investigate the effects of LEC on melanoma cells. The results showed that LEC priming increased metastasis of the WM852 melanoma cell line to distant organs, which was dependent on MP14 and Notch. The study also found that LEC induced β-integr activation in metastatic melanoma cells, required for 3D sprouting of WM852 cells. The upregulation of Not3 upon L priming suggests that L-melan interaction can reveal clinically relevant molecules for cancer dissemination and identify previously unknown pathways contributing to lymphatic metastasis of melanoma.
Researchers have identified a key role for microRNA-9 (miR-9) in controlling dendritic development and synaptic transmission in the brain. mi-9 is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the brain and has been well-characterized in neural progenitors, but its function in dendritic and synaptic development was unknown. To study mi-9 in vivo, a transgenic mouse line was developed allowing conditional inactivation of mi-9 in a spatio-temporally controlled manner. Results showed mi-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo, and that mi-9-mediated downregulation of transcription repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. 

A novel transgenic mouse line was created to characterize mi-9 activity in different cell types in the brain. Analysis of mi-9-SNest-C mouse showed inhibition of mi- results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. Two strains were derived for in vivo: a reporter line to monitor mi- activity at single-cell resolution and a line for mi- loss-of-function. The latter revealed developmental role mi- in postmit differentiation of neurons, as key regulator dendritic and synaptic in vivo. 

mi-9 was studied in postmit stages of differentiation, demonstrating critical role in control dend development in vivo. Other microRN have shown influence dend growth (Wayman et al, 2008; Fi et al 2009; Parrish et 2009; Mag 2010; Pathania 2012; Liu 2013b) suggesting expression genes orchestrating process under post transcriptional regulation. mi-9/REST regulation may play non-developmental roles in mature populations. A transgenic line was developed for conditional inactivation mi family spatio-temporally. Analysis mi-9-C mouse reveals role mi postmit neuronal as regulator dend development through REST expression.
Researchers investigated the neural basis of social engagement difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large sample of toddlers with ASD and non-ASD comparison groups. They found that ASD-related hypoconnectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks. A subtype of ASD with pronounced social visual difficulties (Geo ASD) was characterized by marked DM-occipitotemporal (OTC) hypoconnectivity. Increased DM-OTC hypoconnect was related to severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in GeoASD. Early social-visual hypoconnectivity is a key neurobiological feature of GeoASD and may be critical for future social development and treatment targets. 

A simple eye-tracking test can identify GeoASD with high precision in early development. Social-visual hypoconnect is a key feature of GeoAS and may be critical for social development. Visual difficulties are early features of ASD with high clinical relevance, but neural bases are not well understood. The study found atypical functional brain organization in ASD involving social circuitry in early development. The DM is functionally disconnected from visual cortices and attention network in ASD toddlers. This is important for social difficulties being a symptom in ASD and shared across toddlers. The results suggest heterogeneity in social engagement is for some, but not all, connectivity differences in ASD. This supports the idea that ASD is characterized by hypoconnect between DM, visual, PVC, and OTC, as well as attention circuit in toddlers. A simple, fast, and easy eye-tracking test identifies GeoAS, making it a robust assay for clinically relevant subtype. The study aimed to identify functional connectivity between circuits in ASD and whether heterogeneity in social engagement explains differences.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the hematopoietic organs produce two types of mature hemocytes: plasocytes and crystal cells. Plasocytes are phagocytic and functionally similar to vertebrate macrophages. However, the increase in circulating and sessile crystal cell numbers during larval development is a paradoxical, as mature crystal cells have not been observed dividing during larval stages and crystal cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation under homeostatic conditions. This study reveals that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent plasocyte transdifferentiation process in sessile clusters, contingent on the integrity of these structures. This hematopoietic tissue relies on structure-dependent signaling to promote homeostasis, creating a new paradigm for understanding Dophila hematopoies and vertebrate systems. Macrophages are the most plastic cells in vertebrate hematiet tissue, their specialization in vivo dependent on local microenvironment provided by tissue colonized. Similarly, in Drosila larvae, hemocyte microenvironment induces crystal differentiation from plasocytes through cell-contact involving Notch signaling. The study of hematiet structure and function is essential for understanding mature cell origin and absolute numbers.
Researchers have investigated how cells cope with the negative effects of aneuploidy, a condition where a cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes, until new beneficial phenotypes evolve. They found that aneupidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which surprisingly show lower-than-expected expression in many amplified genes. To understand this, they generated diploid panels of cells with two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes and found that gene dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification, suggesting copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. Aneuploidy provides a clear advantage to strain YPS9 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation. The study presents a model where dosage buffers amplification through aneidy to provide a natural, likely transient route to rapid evolution.
Researchers have identified a new type of light-sensitive protein, called xenopsin, in a type of flatworm called Marig crozier, which challenges current understanding of how animals detect light. Xenin was previously thought to belong to a group of proteins called G-coupled ciliary opsins, but is now found to have diverged from them in early animal evolution. The study found xenin in ciliary cells of the worm's larvae and extraocular cells around the brain in adults. These extraocular cells have hundreds of cilia in a membrane-bound vacuole called a phasome. Functional tests in human cells show xenin drives phototransduction by coupling to G protein. This is similar to ciliary photoreceptors in jawed vertebrates, which enclose cilia in their own membrane.

In adults, xenin was found in extraocular ciliary cells with distinct ultrastructure like jawed vertebrate photoreceptors. Functional assays showed xenin can form photopment and couple to G protein, the first step in phototransduction cascade. Analysis of amino acid sequences and cellular localization suggest G coupling of xenin. Activation of G signal cascade in human cells and localization in ciliary photore in worm support this. Xenin expression on cilia of eyes suggests V motif transports xenin to cilia.

The discovery of xenin ciliary in protostome eyes deviates from invertebrate trend of extraocular photore and ocular photoreceptors. Xenin is both ocular and extra, present in larva. Findings show similarities between xenin and cops and provide molecular and functional evidence of ciliary photore in flatworms. Xenin ability to drive phototrans in human cells and expression in ciliary in Marig add evidence for ciliary photore in flatworm. Metazoan photore are diverse, especially outer segment where cilia increase surface area through stacking or numbers.
Researchers investigated how spatial and temporal cues are integrated to specify neuronal diversity in neural progenitors, using Drosophila neuroblasts as a model. They tested whether spatial and temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts by identifying genomic binding sites of the Hunch temporal factor in two neuroblasts (NB-5 and NB-4) that make different progeny. Hback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent model. Each neuroblast had distinct chromatin domains, correlated with differential H-bound loci in each neuro. Importantly, the Gsbax spatial factor, expressed in NB-6 but not NB-4, had binding sites correlated with chromatin in NB-6 but not NB-4. The study supports a model where early-acting spatial factors like G establish neuroblast-specific chromatin, leading to neuroblast temporal factor binding and production of different neurons in each lineage. Over loci differentially bound by H in NB-6 or NB-4 are candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification.
Researchers have used a novel technique called photo-switchable tweezers to study the mechanism of the P2X receptor, a type of ion channel that opens in response to extracellular ATP. Previous crystal structures of the receptor in both open and closed states showed motions of the extracellular domain after agonist binding, but the mechanism of pore opening remained unclear. The study used photo-switch tweez to monitor distances between residues in the transmembrane domain of the P2 receptor during activation, combining these data with computational studies to create high-resolution models of the channel in open and closed states. The results show that the pore expansion is reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure and that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. This provides new insight into the mechanism of P2 receptors and a strategy for studying other membrane proteins.

 The study used photo-switch tweez in conjunction with simulations to explore the function of a trimer ion channel, showing a decrease in distance between the inner and outer ends of adjacent poreining TM helices through bending at a critical hinge is essential for activation of the P2 receptor. Breaking the TM-TM interface is sufficient for gating, but does not alter sensitivity to ATP, suggesting a local rearrangement of the TMD. The study provides the first application of photoable derivatives to investigate pore gating of P2 receptors. Additional data are needed to understand the mechanism of full-length membrane-embedded P2 receptor.

 The study presents a chemical method to explore gating of the rat2 receptor by cross-linking engineered cystine in T with photoable azobenz tweez, whose end-end distance can be controlled by light. A set of constraints with Molecular Dynamics provided high-resolution models of channel in open and closed states. By contrast, a 2.4-fold decrease in ATP sensitivity was observed for G342 mutant, consistent with alanine rigidifying helices. Data show TM helices in P2 contain a critical hinge facilitating bending, allowing inner and outer to come closer during activation.
Cytokinesis, the physical division of a cell into two, is powered by the constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. Contrary to the assumption that all animal cells divide by a similar mechanism, evidence suggests that cytoketic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastom has a distinct fate specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute treatment, we identified cell-type variation in cytoketic requirement for forminK-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-act) cytoskeleton in one cell (P), whereas this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated in another cell (EMS) dependent on Src-1 signaling and contact with neighbor cell P. Both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytoketic variation in individual types and protect against division failure when contractile ring weakened.

We used thermogenetics, drug, and embryo dissection to probe mechanisms cell-type variation in regulation among blastomeres within four-cell C elegans. We found cell-specific differences in functional and temporal window activity formin-1, but not myosin-I activity during cytokinesis. In contrast, formin- (ts) embryos showed cell variation in temporal requirement among blastom. Our analysis one-cell C elegans cytokinesis failed 100% with formin inactivation by thermal shift at any time before mid-constriction. We used fastacting temperature-sensitive alleles in two proteins contractile constriction one embryo: myos-II and diaphan formin. Identified cell-specific in four embryos requirement formin, not myos-II. Our data show both intrinsic extrinsic mechanisms contribute cytoketic diversity and promote cytokinesis when contractile weakened specific within four Cans.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the flagellar sheath, a membranous structure surrounding some bacterial flagella, in mediating the release of immunogenic lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Vibrio fischer and its pathogenic congener Vibrio cholera. Using the squid-vibrio symbiosis model, they found that rotation of the sheathed flagella promotes the release of LPS, a potent immunogenic molecule, from the flagellar sheath. This challenges the previous hypothesis that the sheath allows bacteria to evade host immune responses by concealing the flagellin subunit. Instead, the study reveals a new role for flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses. This finding has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella and raises questions about the biophysical function of sheathed flagella.

The researchers used the squid-vrio symbiosis model to study the effect of flagellar sheath on host recognition, uncovering a previously unknown role of sheathed flagella in mediating LPS release in V. fischer and V. cholera. The flagellar sheath has been difficult to study, with no mutations resulting in loss of sheath in sheathed flagella. The role of sheath, even in relation to motility, remains poorly characterized, and this new observation furthers understanding of the enigmatic structure and its contribution to virulence. Further work will build on these discoveries, characterizing LPS composition released by V. fischer during flag rotation, identifying squid receptors for V. fischer LPS, and determining flagellin's role in host responses.

The study demonstrates biosynthesis of flagellum and its functions may mediate multiple aspects of symbiotic initiation. Flagellar activation of immunity has been limited to responses to protein flagin, whereas flagin monomers are prevalent in the secretome of V. cholera and V. As tools to study flagellar she are limited, researchers used the squid-vrio model to observe initial colonization events in real-time, probing whether sheathed flag plays a role in symbt host response.
Researchers have identified a phenomenon of catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, resulting from the hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histone H3. This process leads to the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lagg chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucle. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Furthermore, mutation of NHE factor DNA ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. The heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a tractable natural system for investigating causes and mechanisms of genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.

The study describes a previously undescribed phenomenon in Arabidopsis, possibly arising from mitotic defects, not meiotic, which would result in nullis gametes, not viable. Aneupids from mit failure do not have constraints. The altered CEN3G-tswap strain was hybridized to recessive glrous-1 mutant. Results provide evidence for chromosome restructuring when diver individuals hybridize, identifying centrom-based mechanism genomic instability. This phenomenon depends on chimer CEN3, but similar effect observed when haploid strain expresses CEN of close species. DNA ligase-2 mutants suggest NHE plays role in repair of haploid chromosomes contributing diploid anup progeny, NHE inhibited haploid frequency increased. In silico reconstruction suggests NHE involved repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes, contributing anup and diploid progeny, unrepaired double-stranded breaks elimination haploid genome similar mouse-human hybrid elimination.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a causally linked to several human cancers and expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response, leading to uncontrolled proliferation. The viral protein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκ and is critical for survival of EB-immortalized B cells. However, during early EB infection, the virus induces rapid cell proliferation with low levels of L1 and little apoptosis. This study aimed to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of L1/NF after infection. BH profiling was used to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected cells (B-2) to early-infected (M-1/B-2) and immortalized (1) cells. This change in cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected and relies on regulation of M-1 localization and 1 transcription by the EB3 protein. The study defines a new role for EB3 in suppression of apoptosis with implications for EB lymphomagenesis.

 EB3 regulated the BH profile of EB-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting M-1 localization and increasing 1 transcription. transcription was previously shown to be regulated by the EB factor (Pegman et al., 2006) as well as L1-induced NF (Pratt et al.,201). BH profiling found that human peripheral B cells solely depend on for survival while EB infection suppressed apopting during outgrowth by upregulating M, followed by. Mechanistically, a new role for the latent protein EB3 in apoptosis during early and late EB-induced cell proliferation was identified. Human peripheral CD+ B cells depend on for survival and EB upregulates additional proteins to suppress induced by antagonism. BH experiments predicted EB-inf cells are primed due to combined effects M and during proliferation with protection afforded by in immortalized cells (Figure). Constitutive NF signaling from the oncoprotein L, a TN homologue, is thought responsible for suppression in latently proliferating cells (C-Farland et al.,200; et al.,201). However, the burst of cell induced by is driven by expression of viral factors (1,2,3,3,3, and) in absence appreciable or activity (Price et.,201). The mechanism which enhances M- function may provide insight into regulation during-cell and lymphagenesis.
Researchers studied the genetic and environmental factors that influence the production of specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant species that produces diverse chemicals to cope with environmental challenges. They analyzed 797 natural accessions (individuals) and found that geography, environment, demography, and genetics all contribute to the variation in specialized metabolites and their distribution. The study suggests that genetic loci controlling metabolism have independently generated alleles, leading to within-species convergence. This indicates the complexity of selective forces and mechanisms shaping allelic variation for local adaptation.

The study focused on the glucosinolate (GSL) pathway, a known biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis, with major loci for natural variation. The high allelic diversity at these loci raises questions how pathways with this level of diversity pass through speciation boundaries. Brassica species have similar genetic variation creating same chemotypic variation in Arabid. Understanding genetic, demographic, and environmental factors shaping a trait in a population is key to evolution.

The researchers used a family of metabolites, aliphatic GSL, measured in Arabid seeds to query genetics, geography, environment, and demography intersecting chemic variation across Europe. The intersection of pressure, demography, and genomic complexity gives metabolic variation across a species. To understand genomic, demography, and environmental shaping metabolism within a species, Arabid glucosolate (GSL) pathway was used as a model.
Apoptotic caspases have traditionally been viewed as tumor suppressors due to their role in programmed cell death, but recent studies suggest they can also promote tumor growth under certain conditions. In Drosila, a well-studied neoplastic model, oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene RasV maintain tumorous cells in an 'ead-like state and convert caspases from suppressors to promotors. Instead of killing cells, casases generate intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells that signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK amplifies casase activity, constituting a feedback loop. Interfering with the loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves organism survival. Oncogenic Ras suppresses apoptotic casp activity, keeping Ras12 cells in 'ead-like. Casases induce apoptosis in few tumor cells but promote ROS for malignant growth and invasion. This work extends previous models of E and JNK switch from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles by oncogenic and casases as essential components.
Researchers investigated how people's perception of time during social interactions is influenced by their social competency and oxytocin levels. They found that individuals who are more socially competent perceive social interactions as shorter in duration compared to those who are less competent. This effect was stronger in individuals with lower autistic tendencies. Intranasal oxytocin administration restored the effect in less competent individuals, while atosiban, an oxytoc antagonist, diminished it in more competent ones. These findings suggest time is subjective and influenced by personality, and oxyin plays a role in social cognition. 

The study reaffirmed the influence of social interactions on subjective time and tied it to a stable trait - social proficiency. Autistic traits are associated with lower oxyin levels and can be improved with intranas oxyin administration. The link between autistic tendency and social interaction duration raises the question if oxyin plays a role. To verify, the effect of oxyin was antagonized in socially proficient individuals. Mechanism involves oxyin. Less individuals have lower endogenous oxyin. Experiment probed if oxyin application would promote interaction compression in less individuals. Same task as Experiment was employed.
Researchers investigated the effects of common mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) and its ligand, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), on their binding affinity and kinetics. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV variants of concern that have emerged worldwide, such as the B.1.1.1.7 lineage, which has a mutation N501 in its RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE alleles in humans with mutations in the R binding site. The study analyzed the effects of five RBD mutations (K417N, K417, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE mutations (S19 and K26) on the R/ACE interaction. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of R/ACE interaction, except for K417/T, which decreased it. The results suggest that N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission by binding, K417/T facilitate immune escape, and E484 enhances both binding and escape.

The study analyzed individual R mutations and combinations in SARS-Co-2 Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P) variants. The effect of increased affinity for SARS-Co-2 Spike RBD of K26 and S19 ACE mutants is less clear. Evidence suggests that R/ACE binding is limiting for SARS-2 transmission, so carriers of these ACE variants are at risk of infection and/or disease. However, in contrast to SARS-2 R mutations, effects of ACE variants are relevant to carriers of these mutations.

The study also examined ACE binding of combinations of R mutations, including present in VOC-202-02, a subset of Alpha (501) with E484 mutation, and Beta and Gamma variants. The SARS-2 enters cells following interaction between Spike (S) on surface with ACE on surfaces. The RBD of Spike binds membrane-distal portion of ACE protein. Precise information is needed to assess the extent R mutations enhance ACE binding or facilitate evasion. The study undertook detailed affinity and kinetic analysis of R and ACE at physiological (37°C), avoiding common pitfalls.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of genetic interactions in Drosophila cells, a type of fruit fly, to understand how genes interact and influence development and disease. They used a combination of RNA interference and single-cell imaging to study 136 genes involved in cellular processes such as signaling, chromatin, and cell cycle regulation. Statistical analysis predicted gene functions based on interactions and clustered genes by similarity. The map revealed a network of protein activities during mitosis and an interaction between the Ras pathway and SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, which is conserved in human cancer cells. This study provides a method for reconstructing regulatory networks and interpreting genetic alterations.

The researchers generated the largest map of multi-phenotype genetic profiles in metazoan cells by combining gene pairs RNA interference, high-throughput imaging, and modeling. They selected 136 genes in key biological processes, including signaling, chromatin, cell regulation, and protein control. They demonstrated an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAP signaling and SW/SWI regulators of chromatin remodelling, confirmed in vivo. They showed directional interactions can be identified at scale and mapped to other data to identify relationships.

The multivariate approach revealed a detailed diagram of regulatory and causal relationships during mitosis. The map highlighted an unexpected link between chromatin remodelling and RAS signaling, with interactions between SWI/S complex and SWI-associated chrom remeller.
Researchers have identified the genetic basis of heterosty, a widespread floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding, in the Primula genus. Heterosty is controlled by the S-loc supergene, which determines the arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between two morphs, but the identities of the component genes were unknown. The study found that the Primula CYP50 gene, encoding a brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, is the locus that determines style dimorphism. CYP50 is present on the short-styled morphotype, specifically expressed in short styles, and its loss leads to long styles. The gene arose by duplication in the Primulaceae lineage and shows accelerated molecular evolution. The results provide a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and shed light on the evolution of the Sloc as a model for a complex supergene.

The study found that CYP50 represents the locus in the Prim hetery super, whose expression in short styles causes brassoster degradation, limiting cell expansion and elongation. Evolutionarily, C50 arose via lineage-specific duplication and gain of style-specific expression. The proposed duplication and gain of style expression in the ancestor of Prim likely represents the dominant-short mutation. C50 is an example of a causal locus in a super underlying adaptive polymorphism that opens understanding the origin of the Prim Sloc as a complex.

The study sequenced transcriptomes of distantly related Prim species and found C50 presence/absence strictly cosegregates with morph in all heterous species across the Prim phylogeny, and is absent in all cases of long. With V results, strongly supports that C50 is the locus of the heter super that determines style polymorphism. Heter in Prim is controlled by the Sloc super that comprises tightly linked genes determining length, anther, pollen, and female-morph incompatibility.
Researchers have investigated the role of kisspept neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (KissARH) in regulating gonadotrop-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion. They used optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular, and pharmacology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice to study the cellular basis of synchronized kissAR activity. High-frequency photostimulation of kissAR neurons evoked the release of excitatory neuropeptide NKB and inhibitory neurope dynorphin, which synchronized kissAR neuronal firing. The light-evoked activity caused robust excitation of GRH neurons through a mechanism involving glutamateric input to preoptic kiss neurons from kissAR. KissAR neurons play a dual role in driving episodic secretion of GRH through differential release of peptide and amino neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.

 Studies have shown that fibers expressing kisspe or coexpressing kisspe are localized in the internal zone of median eminence in mice and rats. Activation of kissAR neurons with optogen stimulation generates LH release in vivo, thought to be kisspein-mediated depolarization of GR terminals. High photostimulation of kissAR induced N-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), modulated by co-released dynin, and synchronization of kiss neurons. Activation of kissAR coleased glutamate that excited rostral kissAV/Pe neurons. Combination of synchronization and excitation of kissAVPe resulted in robust excitation GR.

KissAR neurons communicate with kissAVPe via fast neurotransmitter glutamate, stimulating burstiring kissAVPe. Activation of rostral kiss releases kisspein to excite GR via GPR signaling, stimulating release at preovulatory surge. Kisspein, GPR, N, Tac3, and GR are required for normal fertility.
Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and favoring mesodermal over neural fates during differentiation, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Researchers found that BMP suppresses differentiation by downregulating Cdh, an event that accompanies earliest stages of neural and mesermal differentiation. Loss of Cdh is a requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and suppression of Cdh rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. BMP acts prior and independently of Cdh to prime plurip cells for mesod differentiation, reinforcing the block to neural. Differentiation depends on exposure to extrinsic cues and morphetic events controlling receptivity to those cues. A key pluripot signal, BMP, feeds into this mechanism.

BMP maintains pluripotency through Cdh, which interferes with neural and mesermal differentiation. Higher BMP levels impose posterior identity, priming cells for mesod and incompatible with neural fate. Findings explain why BMP protects plurotency and promotes mesod differentiation. Cdh loss is a limiting event for earliest neural differentiation, and BMP controls differentiation by maintaining Cdh expression. Changes in adhesion to transcription control fate specification are used in development to coordinate morphogenesis. BMP target Id imposes proximal identity on undifferentiated cells, priming towards mesod. Id blocks neural differentiation by shifting plurotent identity in absence of differentiation.

BMP protects plurotency and suppresses neural specification, but mechanisms unclear. Signalling is required for mesoderm in vivo. BMP is also required for formation of mes in vivo.
Researchers have identified a protein called C120 that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of centrioles, the components of the centrosome, in quiescent cells. Centrioles are inherently asymmetric structures that differ in morphology and function, and their properties are established and maintained during quiescence. Depletion of C120 in mouse and human cells leads to accumulation of pericentolar material (PCM) components, including pericentr, C5ap2, ninein, and C170. Elevated PCM levels result in microtubule-nucleation at the centome, and loss of C120 causes aberrant dyin-dependent trafficking of centomal proteins, dispersal of centolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. C120 helps maintain centome homeostasis by inhibiting untimature of the daughter centole. The protein is enriched on the outer wall of centolar microtubules and regulates the distribution of PCM proteins at the centome. Loss of C120 disrupts ciliary assembly and function, likely due to aberrant CS-dependent trafficking of proteins to the centome. Dispersal of CS upon C120 disrupts the formation and function of cilia during qucence. The study establishes the importance of centome homeasis and its relationship to ciliary assembly and signaling, and uncovers a new molecular defect that may underlie the pathogenesis of ciliies such as Jeune and Jert syndrome.
Researchers investigated the communication between neurons and Müller glial cells (MCs) in the developing retina, a critical for neural circuit maturation. They found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in MCs, which were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists during cholinergic waves and ionotropic glutamate antagonists during glutamaterg waves, indicating MC responsiveness matches neurotransmitter used in retinal waves. Using an glutamate sensor, they showed decline in MC transients caused by reduction in glutamate reaching MC. This indicates neurons and MC exhibit correlated activity during retinal maturation enabled by neurotransmitter spillo from retinal synapses.

 Whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells and two-photon imaging of glutamate sensors in MC showed neurotransmitters released during retinal waves induce MC transients. The study elucidated spatio-temporal and molecular pathways between neurons and MC, finding retinal waves correlated with transients in MC, demonstrating activity in both neuronal and glial networks at this age. Mechanism between neurons and MC observed during cholin ret waves similar to cortex and hippocampus, where cholin stimulation leads astrote trans via musinic acetylch receptors and IP3. Whether activity retinal guides MC development unclear, physiological results indicate MC express multiple receptors, allowing control activity sustained as synchronization shifts from cholin to glutamg signaling.

The proportion MC responding to waves with trans decreased from P9 to P11, despite retinal waves presence. MC express various receptors, including glutam and cholin, trans at different ages could be evoked by neurotrans released retinal. Researchers explored transmitters modulating neuron-MC at developmental stages.
Researchers have developed a novel method to estimate the post-mortem interval (PMI), the time since death, using microbial changes in a mouse model system. Current methods, such as forensic entomology, are prone to errors and biases, with estimates ranging from days to months. Microbes offer a potential solution to these limitations. The study demonstrates that post-mortem microbial changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model, allowing PMI to be estimated within 3-48 days. The research provides a detailed understanding of bacterial and fungal ecology within a decomposing system, suggesting microbial data can be developed into a forensic tool for PM estimation.

The study rigorously tested hypotheses about the role of microbes in decomposition and whether changes in communities are predictable over the decomposition timeline, crucial for using microbes as a "clock" to estimate PM. The data not only understand the underlying ecology of decomposition but also the feasibility of microbes as evidence. It was tested whether microbial change is measurable and directional during decomposition to estimate past events like PM. Pech et al. (2013) showed skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent change during swine decomposition over 5 days. This study expands by characterizing microbial change in three external and one internal site in 40 sampled corpses over 48.

The approach differs from prior work, which models were evaluated by explaining variation in all data, being fit to all points (Pech et al, 201). A proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial ecology of decomposing has potential to be a forensic tool for PM estimation was provided. A laboratory experiment was conducted to characterize changes in microbial associated with corpses decomposing on soil for 48. Bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes were characterized using DNA sequencing for each sample.
Researchers have investigated the origin of the Hox patterning system, a set of developmental genes conserved in bilaterian animals that define identities along the anterior-posterior axis. Hox proteins interact with TALE factors to exert their function. H and TALE are present in some non-bilater phyla, raising the question of how these interactions evolved to provide positional information. Using unicellular and multicellular lineages, it was found that these networks emerged from an ancestral motif in Hox and related proteins. H-T networks experienced additional innovations crucial for differentiating H functions along body plans. The study highlights how homeobox families evolved to constitute a patter system in eumazo.

Hox genes are expressed along the anterosterior axis of bilian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. They are thought to have contributed to morphological diversification of bilian during evolution. These networks rely on molecular properties that originated from an ancestral mode kept in home gene families. The study describes the molecular underlying H-T patter system in Bil established during eary evolution. It was found that developmental genes can display dissimilar patterns or be absent in non-b lineages, showing mechanisms are not universal. The H gene family was considered highly conserved in the kingdom. Cnidaria is the only non-b phylum with a H repertoire, others lack genes. This raises the question of how H acquired axial functions during metazo evolution. In Bil, patter functions rely on P and Me proteins present in non-b phyla.
Researchers used super-resolution microscopy to study the behavior of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) at synapses, specifically examining how the size and photostability of fluorescent probes affected their trafficking outside and within post-synaptic densities (PSD) in rat neurons. They found that 90% of AMPs labeled with small fluorescent dyes or quantum dots (QDs) were diffusing in confined nanodomains in PSD, which were stable for 15 minutes or longer, while less than 10% of Q-AMPs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, 5-10% of Q-AMPs were in PSD and 90-95 were extrasynaptic. Contrary to the hypothesis that AMP entry is limited by occupancy of PSD slots, findings suggest AMPs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSD with lifetime >15 minutes and do not accumulate extrasyn membranes.

Using QDs, they studied dynamics of nanodom of AMP in synapses for periods up to 60 minutes, observing 126 synapses. Findings were similar to those using spars labeled Q and organic dyes on live neurons. Localization of AMP is predominantly at synaptic regions. In fixed samples, typically one nanomain per synapse, multiple nanodom exist. Factors influencing diffusion of surface-expressed AMPs (Chamma et al, 2016; Frischnecht et 2009) are described. Labeling with QDs is problematic due to number of DIVs. With QDs, no accumulation of large extrasyn receptors found, instead motion constrained diffusion in PSD nanodom.

Using smaller fluorophores (QDs or organic), 84-97 of AMPs were immobilized in PSD, 5-16 freely diffusing in dendrite. Believing QDs too large for AMPs to enter synaptic. Determining AMP or neurotransmitter synaptic (PSD) or extrasyn (PSD) has been difficult due to factors: synapses nanometer below diffraction limit, microscopy 2D, not 3D, recombinant probes distinguish intracellular.
Researchers have identified a mechanism by which neurons respond to acute hypoxia, an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (IN). They found that hypox activates the Smallubiquitin Modifier (SUM) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CG) and SUMylation of Na1.2 channels increases IN. The time-course of SUMylation of Na1.2 channels at the surface and IN coincide, and are prevented by mutation of Na1-Lys38 or application of deSUMylating enzyme. Within 40 seconds, hypox-induced linkage of SUM1 to channels is complete, shifting the voltage dependence of activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. Given the role of IN in hypoxic brain damage, the SUM pathway and Na1.2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions.

The study shows that hypia SUMylation of Na.2 channels is observed in the presence of TTX, indicating that sodium flux is not prerequisite for channel SUMylation. Consistent with control of IN by the SUM pathway, SUM and SEN1 increased and decreased current, respectively, under normoxic conditions. The response of IN to hypox was ablated by µ-Conotoxin-TII (CTX), a blocker of Na. channels. Supporting the mechanism, SUMylation of Na.2 channels at CG plasma membrane in response to hypox was shown to increase interaction of SUM and Na. The study suggests that Na. channels and SUM enzymes may be valuable targets for reducing damage due to acute insults to central neurons.
Researchers have developed a mechanistic model to predict the thermal response of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia and the Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. The model reveals that transmission peaks at moderate temperatures of 26.4°C and declines to zero at thermal limits of 17.0 and 31.5°C. This suggests that Ross River virus is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in a seasonal peak in human cases. Climate change is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas where most Australians live, but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are near the thermal optimum.

The study highlights the importance of nonlinear models in inferring temperature's role in disease dynamics and predicting climate responses. As the climate warms, understanding temperature's effects on mosquito-borne disease transmission is crucial, particularly with new pathogens emerging worldwide. Identifying optima and limits by characterizing thermal responses, rather than assuming transmission increases with temperature, can accurately predict geographic and seasonal disease variation.

The research parameterized a temperature-dependent model for RRV with data from two vector species, C. annirostris and Ae. vigil. Results support a pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission, with optimal temperature driven by adult lifespan, but upper and lower limits uncertain, determined by unique vector-pathogen traits. The strongest temperature signal on disease is in temperate regions where temperature varies along the rising portion of the R curve (20-25°C). Mean temperatures above and below the optimum, like Darwin, may mask temperature effects in linear models.

Upper limits of mosquito-borne transmission, a concern for climate change, are determined by vector life traits with symmetrical performance (fecundity and survival) rather than asymmetrical traits (biting or pathogen rate). Trait data were limited in two ways.
Researchers investigated the relationship between beta oscillations in the motor cortex and movement onset by recording neural activity from macaques performing a novel neurofeedback task. The task involved bringing beta power to an instructed state and then executing an arm reach. Results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power had faster onset times than those preceded by an increase in power. Additionally, population activity shifted from a movement state during beta oscillations induced by neurofeedback or naturally occurring during reaching. This establishes a population basis for slowed onset periods following beta activity.

The shift in population was also seen in naturally occurring oscillations during reaching, suggesting beta reflects common spiking patterns in different contexts. This ties together behavioral correlates of beta with how the cortex encodes movement through population-level activity.

Increasing and decreasing cortical power with neurofeedback preceded slower and faster onset times, supporting beta linked to patterns slow onset movements. Results add to findings of elevated power prior and after trained movements. The effect from neuro-induced oscillations matches a movement-slow role of beta during natural movements. However, individual unit responses during beta differed across tasks. Cortical population shifts from a threshold when subjects produce oscillations in the task or naturally produce them.

Simultaneously recorded units exhibited different activity during neurofeedback beta compared natural oscillations during reaching. Despite individual differences, population analyses show beta promote a movement-slow state both tasks, matching behavior.
TRAF2 plays a crucial role in regulating TNF and NF-κB signaling to suppress apoptosis and inflammation in skin, independently of sphingosine kinase 1. TR2, a component of the TN superfamily, is essential for immune cell homeostasis, and TR2 deficient mice die at birth, making its role in adult tissues unclear. The TR2 RING domain's function is controversial, with some claiming it cannot act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, while others require sphingine-1-phosphate, generated by sphingine kinase 1, to function as an E3 ligase. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of TR2, but not sph1 deficiency, disrupts TN mediated NFκ and MAPK signaling, causing epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation is driven by TN, non-canonical NFκ, and the adaptive immune system, representing a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TR2 has tissue-specific functions that do not overlap with sph1.

In the absence of TR2, TN-induced NF and MAPK activation is delayed, and sensitivity to TN is increased. TR2 deficient keratinocytes in vivo result in ps-like epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation. Unlike TN-dependent skin conditions, such as IK2 epider knock-out and cp mutant, concurrent deletion of TN and NF2 reverses the inflammatory phenotype. Our results highlight TR's role in protecting keratinocytes from death and downregulating responses, supporting intrinsic defects in keratin initiate psoriasis-like skin. TR-deficient keratinocytes do not need bacterial stimulation to produce TN, and TN-induced sets a vicious cycle of inflammation. Concurrent deletion of TN with TR-deficient keratin breaks this cycle, preventing apoptosis and onset of ps-like phenotype.

Primary keratinocytes from wild-type, TR2KO, and sph1- mice show delayed TN signaling and weakened in TR-deficient, but not sph1-deficient. TR2-def, but not sph1-, keratinocytes are sensitive to TN-induced death, associated with reduced cFLPL and caspase cleavage. In absence TN, TR-def keratin still produce inflammatory via non-canonical NFκ, generating ps-like phenotype but slower. These cytokines recruit immune cells, including neutrophils and IF cells.
Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are organelles that store and secrete neurotransmitters at synapses. Following exocytosis, their membranes are rapidly recaptured by endocytosis and recycled for generation of new fusion-competent SVs. Clathrin-mediated endocyt (CME) is thought to play a key role in this endytic traffic. However, research suggests the existence of an alternative pathway for SV formation that bypasses the requirement for clrin and dynamin 1/3, operating during intense synaptic activity. In dynamin 1 and 3 double-knockout neurons, clrin-mediated endocyt is impaired, but massive formation of endosomes is not defective, rather enhanced. Subsequent conversion of endosomes to SV occurs without clrin-coated buds on their surface and proceeds after clrin knockdown, indicating independence from clrin. These findings support a pathway for SV formation independent of clrin and dynamin 1/3, operating during intense synaptic activity.
Researchers conducted a randomized, crossover study to identify biomarkers of glucocorticoid (GC) action in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. Ten patients were admitted to a clinic and underwent physiological GC exposure and withdrawal, with no serious adverse events reported. Multi-omic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, adipose tissue, plasma, and serum revealed a transcriptomic profile predictive of GC exposure. A microRNA (miR-122p) correlated with GC-regulated genes and metabolites was identified (p=0.009) and replicated in independent studies with varying GC exposure (0.01≤p≤0.05). The study provides a basis for discovering biomarkers to measure GC effects and optimize therapy, shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological GC exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids, specifically focusing on the role of the lysosome in this process. They used live imaging of the mTOR component RAP and a fluorescent analogue of leucine methyl ester to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of mTOR1 translocation to lysosomes. Results showed that translocation to lysosomes is a transient event occurring within 2 minutes of amino addition, peaking at 5 minutes, and is temporally coupled with leuc appearance in lysosomes. Sestr2 and vacu ATPase are negative regulators of mTOR activity in this system. Phosphorylation of canonical mTOR targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTOR from lysosomal surface to target substrates elsewhere.

The study used H-1 cells to examine mTOR response to lysosomal amino acids and generated a permeant fluorescent leuc analogue to image RAP translocation. Leuc has a prominent role in mTOR activation and leuc methyl ester enters cells and accumulates in lysosomes activating m on its own. A series of leuc analogues were tested for mTOR activation, suggesting the lysosome is crucial for m activation but dynamics may be more complicated than current models. mTOR subunits were tagged with GFP to follow localization in live cells, and a leuc analogue with fluorescent moiety produced sustained translocation due to accumulation in lysosomal lumen.

Data provide a dynamic view of mTOR response to amino, supporting the idea amino activate m in cell interior, possibly multiple types involved. Leuc is sensed by Sestr1/2, while arginine entering lys via SLC9 is also important for mTOR activation.
Researchers have discovered that modifying antigens with specific glycan structures, such as the Lewis X (Le) glycan, can alter their intracellular routing in dendritic cells and promote the priming of T cells. Dendritic cells regulate antigen uptake and intracellular routing through C-type lectin receptors that recognize glycan structures. In this study, Ovalbumin (OVA) was modified with the LeX glycan, directing it to the C lectin receptor M1 (M1). This modification favored Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8 T cells. Cross-presentation of native VA required high antigen and TLR stimuli, but Le modification reduced the amount 100-fold and eliminated its dependence on TLR signaling. The VA-Le induced enhancement of T cross-priming was M1-dependent, as shown by reduced CD8 effector cell frequencies in M1-deficient mice. Moreover, M1-mediated cross-presentation of VA did not require T-transporters or Cathepsin and was observed after prolonged intracellular storage in Rab+AMP+ compartments. The study concludes that controlled glycosylation of antigens crucially influences intracellular routing, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing vaccination strategies.
Burkholderia thailandensis, a bacterium, uses a quorum sensing (QS) system to regulate hundreds of genes, including cell-cell dependent type VI (T) secretion (TSS) toxin immunity systems. Research shows that QS activates TSS in B. thailandensis, and TSS is required to restrict the proliferation of QS mutants in cocultures of a B. thailand QS signal receptor mutant and its parent. However, the QS mutant is not restricted and outcompetes its parent in broth culture, presumably due to lack of cell contact and metabolic cost associated with QS activation. The fitness of wild type over QS mutant during agar growth depends on intact TSS apparatus. QS activates B. thensis TSS growth inhibition, serving to police and constrain QS mutants. This defines a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control.

Research demonstrates QS control of TSS-mediated toxicity and immunity allows competent B. thensis colonies to police against QS mutants. During planktonic growth in broth, TSS does not function due to limited contact, QS mutants have a fitness advantage over wild type, due to cost associated with QS activities. A mechanism is described where wild populations mitigate QS cost by hindering growth of mutants via regulation of cell-dependent toxin and immunity proteins. This is a form of policing, QS-competent bacteria outcompete populations of signal non-operators in absence of T cell growth system.

A novel mechanism is described for limiting QS growth in bacterial groups. T. thensis TSS-mediated killing is against Proteobacteria other than B.ensis, important for interspecies competition. Results show TSS-mediated killing does not occur in liquid cocultures. The parent with intact QS expresses QS-activated TSS toxin and immunity, while QS mutant does not fully induce TSS effectors and immunity. Bacterial QS often controls factors in groups, cooperative activities, well-stud type mediated by acylomine lactone (AHL) signals. AHLs made by Lux family synthases, diffuse out cells.
Researchers investigated the role of glutamatergic neurons in the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus in driving prefrontal oscillations in neonatal mice. They used optogenetic manipulation to selectively target glutamaterg neurons in the CA1 area of the dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefront oscillatory entrainment. Results showed that despite stronger theta and ripples in the dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex was mainly coupled with the intermediate/ventral hippocampus through phase-locking of neuronal firing via direct axonal projections. Theta-band activation of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/vent but not dorsal CA1, transfected with high-efficiency channelrhopsin, boosted prefront oscillations. The data causally elucidated the origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain. 

The temporal delay of 10-20 ms between prefront and hippocal spike trains and estimated direction of information flow between areas suggested hippocal drives oscillatory entrainment of local circuits in PFC. The data directly proved this hypothesis using optogenetic manipulation of networks at neonatal age. Theta-specific activation of pyram neurons in CA area intermediate and ventral but not dorsal elicited broad oscillations in PFC of neon mice via axonal projections. Tight coupling and information flow from hippocal CA to P via axonal suggested HP acts as drive for prelim activation at neon age. Differences between dorsal and ventral communication argued for prominent driving force along septo-temporal axis. Optogen protocol represented prerequisite for this investigation, opening perspectives for assessing adult readout long communication in developing brain.
Researchers have identified a new post-translational modification of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAPI), specifically the methylation of lysine residues at the C-terminal domain (CTD). This modification, known as Kme1 and K2, occurs early in the transcription process and precedes or accompanies phosphorylation of serine residues at positions 5 and 7. In contrast, acetylation of lysine 7 (Kac) is associated with productive elongation, serine phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. An unexpected balance between methylation and acetylation of lysine 7 at promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels. RNAPI binds to promoters in a hypophosphorylated state, before becoming phosphorylated at serine 5 and 7, marking the earliest stages of transcription. Productive elongation is characterized by increased phosphorylation of serine 2 throughout gene bodies, with highest levels around transcription end sites. New antibodies to Kme and K2 show these modifications are present at promoters of productively transcribed genes, but at earliest stages of transcription. Mutation of K residues is compatible with viability in mouse fibroblasts, suggesting ser phosphorylation and RNAPI localization are independent of presence or absence of K. Acetylation of K residues is associated with inducible expression and increased Kme and K2 with number of K residues, flanked by different amino acids. Mono and di-methylation of K residues is detected in hypophosphorylated forms of RNAPI, suggesting methylation with early stages of transcription. Results suggest productive transcription at genes with RNAPI recruitment to promoters modulated at level K modifications, methylation with less transcription and acylation highest expressed.
Skeletal muscle satellite cells, also known as satellite cells, play a crucial role in muscle repair and regeneration by exiting quiescence, proliferating, and self-renewing to replenish the satellite population. To understand the mechanisms maintaining satellite quies, researchers identified transcripts differentially expressed during satellite activation following injury. Transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins, including Tristetrolin, were significantly changed. Tristrol promotes decay of MyD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, by binding to MyD's 3' untranslated region. Upon satellite activation, p38/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPK2 and inactivates Tristrol, stabilizing MyD. Satellite-specific knockdown of Tristrol prematurely activates cells in vivo, enabling My accumulation, differentiation, and fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristrol functions as a critical post-transcriptional mechanism controlling satellite homeostasis.

MyD upregulates its own transcription, injury triggering a feed-forward loop resulting inD expression driving satellite cells to commit to myoblasts. Researchers propose that TTP may be involved in downregulating MyD and other T-target transcripts byoblasts during initial quies SC population formation or reacquisition of quies following injury. TTP is present in quies SCs, rapidly inhibited by pαβ MAP within minutes of activation, and reduces MyD half-life. Loss of T from muscle preciously activates SC, promoting MyD expression and aberrant cycle entry. pαβ MAP-dependent phosphorylation of T upon activation suggests T plays a role in maintaining quies. T inactivation preceding My upregulation is consistent with T actively suppressing proogenic mRNA targets.
Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor develop very early-onset inflammatory bowel disease. Researchers investigated whether IL-10 regulates lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy. They found that signs of colitis are absent in IL-10 deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, but intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction begin in the third week of life, concurrent with weaning and diversification of the intestinal microbiota. IL-10 did not directly regulate the microbial ecology during infant development. Macrophage depletion with clodron inhibited the development of colitis, while absence of IL-10 on macrophages sensitized infant mice to development of colitis. These results indicate IL-10 mediated regulation of macrophage during early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing murine colitis.
In C. elegans, the Tudor domain protein SIM-1 (SIM-1) plays a crucial role in the piRNA pathway, which regulates transposons and germline genes. SIM-1 acts downstream of piRNA production and upstream of the mutator complex, which synthesizes high levels of siRNAs through an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. SIM-1 localizes to distinct cytoplasmic foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two separate condensates that are sites of pi-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. This suggests a role for perinuclear condens in organizing the pi pathway and promoting regulation by the mut complex.

 SIM-1 is required at the step between pi pathway and mut complex, bridging the gap between primary and secondary phases of the C. elegans silencing pathway. It localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, gran, and Mut foci, implicating distinct peruclear condens in regulation by the pi pathway and mut complex. This identifies SIM- as a factor downstream PR-1 mediating production of siRNAs by the mut complex and a role for peruclear condens promoting regulation by pi and mut.

The C. elegans RNA amplification pathway depends on the mut complex, an RNA-dependent polymer synthesizing secondary siRNAs from pi-targeted mRNAs to trigger heritable silencing. Several proteins localize or near Pules, including GL-1-2-3-4, DDX-19, L-14, and VB-1. One could serve a function to DE-12, shuttling pi-target mRNAs into SIM- and Mut foci. Numerous have been identified in C. elegans for pi transcription, trimming, and modification.
Researchers have investigated the behavior of Purkin neurons in zebraf larvae, which are crucial for cerebellar function, to determine if they exhibit bistability in vivo. Previous studies have shown bistability in vitro or under anesthesia, but its existence in awake animals is disputed. Intracellular recordings from unanhetized larval zraf demonstrate bistability, with tonic firing at depolarized and bursting at hyperpolar membrane potentials. Purkin neurons can switch between states spontaneously or with current injection. GABA or NMDA receptors are not required for bursting, but AMP receptor activation by climbing fibers (CFs) triggers bursts. Recording Purkin membrane potential intracellular and motor spikes extracellular show initiation is correlated with increased CFs and depolarization. Developmentally, bistability is observed after Purkin specification and persists until late larval stages.

The study found two types of glutamateric excitation: strong from CFs and weak from parallel fibers (PFs) mediated by AMP receptors. Bistability in Purkin neurons has been reported in vitro in mammals and in vivo under anesthesia, but not in awake animals. Recordings from larval zraf from 4-19 days post-fertilization (dpf) allow studying intracellular dynamics in the context of fictive motor output. Bist may be a property of developing network not present in mature cerebellum. Zraf Purkin exhibit bist in vivo dependent on AMP-mediated CF inputs. Conservation of cerebell properties suggests bist is conserved from fish to mammals. In vivo, Purkin can be tonic or bursting, toggling between modes. Intracellular recordings confirm spikes are sodium-dependent, broad calcium-mediated, and large events are excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPs).
Researchers have investigated the principles of self-organization and adaptation of the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells internalize molecules from the external environment. They developed a multiscale model that shows a minimal actin network is sufficient to internalize endytic pits against membrane tension. Approximately 200 Arp/3 complexes are required for robust internalization, and experiments determined that ~200 Arp/3 complexes assemble at sites of clrin-mediated endocyt in human cells. Simulations predict actin selforganizes into a branched array with ends toward the base of the pit. Actin filaments bend between the coat and base of the pit, storing elastic energy confirmed by cryo-electron tomography, contributing to endytic internalization. Elevated tension directs filaments toward the base, increasing actin nucleation and bending for force production. Spatially constrained actin assembly utilizes an adaptive mechanism for endocyt under varying physical constraints.

A continuum mechanics model with filament simulations of actin polymerization and endytic internalization was integrated to develop a multiscale model of actin mammalian endocyt. Results show a branched actin is sufficient for sustained internalization against mammalian membrane tension. Actin selforganization and bending, from act-coat attachments around the pit, allow adaptation to changing loads. Approximately 200 Arp/3 molecules accumulate at clrin endocyt sites over time. Incorporating Ar2 number into the multiscale model, simulations were conducted to investigate act organization and force capacity of the endytic network. Actin selforganized around the pit.
Researchers have investigated the process of macropocytosis, a mechanism by which cells take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles, and found that it depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macinocytic cup. In Dictyostelium, macinocytic cups are organized around intense patches of P3, active and Ras, and active. These patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR at their periphery, a structure also found in phagocytic cups and basal waves. The formation of patches does not depend on the F-actin ring and becomes enlarged when RasGAP1 is mutated, indicating Ras plays an instructive role. Macinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. The researchers propose that cup-shaped plasma structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/3, which recruit a ring of actinators to their periphery.

Using 3D light microscopy, researchers mapped the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SC and WAS with respect to signalling molecules P3 and active. This led to a new hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane. Macinocytic cups form from projections of the plasma membrane whose walls are driven by actin polymerization, containing a central patch of activated Ras and P throughout their life. In Dictyostel, this patch is associated with a ring active SC at the edge. The ring of active SC is proposed to be recruited by signalling and drives a ring F-act to extend the walls of the macinocytic cup.

Macinocytic cups can persist on the cell surface for periods before closing or regressing into the body. Closure can be abrupt and involves the inward collapse of the rim. Ras stimulates macinocytosis in mammalian and Dictostel cells, and macocytic cups are associated with intense domain of P. This is essential for function. However, recent work suggests For contributes to the base of the macinocytic but not extending. Alternatively, SC might be moved to periphery Ras/ patches by myosin motors.
Researchers have determined the structure of the Scc protein in complex with a fragment of the S2 protein, revealing that S4 envelops an extended S2 peptide through a TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) array. This interaction is crucial for cohesin localization, a protein complex that holds sister chromatids together until anaphase initiation. The study used budding yeast to demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of S4 is required to recruit S2/4 to centromeres and pericentere, establishing a molecular basis for S2/4 recruitment to centromeres. Proper cohes loading is essential for cell division, and defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcription, leading to developmental defects in multicellular organisms. The findings show that S4 determines cohes localization through a conserved patch on its surface, separable from its role in establishing sisterid cohesion across the genome.
A study investigated the effects of being born late in the active season on growth, fattening, tor use, winter survival, and fecundity in garden dormice (Eliomys quinus). Late-born (LB) juveniles grew and fattened twice as fast as early-born (EB) individuals. During growth, tor use was low, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher tor use, reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB before hibernation. LB individuals showed similar hibernation patterns, but higher breed proportion during the following year than EB dormice. These results suggest tor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates preibern fat deposits. In dormice born late in season is associated with fast life history.

The study hypothesized that LB dormice grow and fatten at higher rates due to higher tor use, reach preibern levels of body but lower fat, leading differences hibern patterns and losses compared EB individuals. LB and food ad-libitum vs intermittently fast on growth and preibern fatt, use energy strategies daily tor, body and fat prior hibern, subsequent patterns losses, and fecity spring female dormice. This aligns with findings common dormice producing two litters, no differences winter between EB and LB detected (Bieber et al, 2012). Preibern reserves LB sufficient fuel shorter hibern due five-weeks delay start. Extensive tor use incompatible with growth, supports preibern fattening late and fat preservation previously deposited prior hibern, especially EB higher reserves prior hibern compared LB. LB delayed hibern by five weeks.
Researchers investigated the role of ADAR (adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing) in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, specifically focusing on its impact on chemotaxis, the process of navigating towards or away from chemical stimuli. Previous studies have shown that Caenorhabdis lacking ADAR enzymes exhibit reduced chemotaxis, but the responsible targets remained unknown. The study aimed to identify critical ADAR targets in Caenor by analyzing the effects of ADR-2, the only AD enzyme in Caenor, on the neural transcriptome. Using software SAIL, 736 AD-to editing events were identified across the neural transcriptome, intersecting with ADR-2 associated gene changes revealed edited mRNA cle-41, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 in ADR deficient cells rescued chemot defect, providing evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered gene expression. This is the first study linking a phenotype to loss of Caenor AD enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a gene.
Influenza A virus (IAV) employs a strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation while allowing efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Researchers used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms behind IAV-induced shutoff and found that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated, leading to a decline in cellular protein synthesis mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool. The study revealed variability in levels of cellular transcript reduction, with short mRNAs being less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV infection are enriched in maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, and continuous phosphorylation activity is crucial for viral propagation. The findings advance understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest a mechanism facilitating translation of genes with housekeeping functions.

The analysis showed viral translation efficiencies within the range of host translation, indicating viral mRN are preferentially translated during IAV and co-opting of translation does not play a dominant role in gene shutoff. Instead, systematic analysis demonstrates host sh stems from viral dominance over mRNA. At 8 hours post-infection, viral mRNAs take over 53% of translation activity, while 57% of mRNAs in cells are viral. The results are consistent with NS not required for sh of host protein production. To access host machinery, viruses utilize sh mechanisms eliminating competition from transcripts. Sh could be achieved by two mechanisms: direct coing of machinery forcing translation viralRN compared to counterparts, exemplified by poliovirus.
Researchers have investigated how gradients of signaling proteins, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), contribute to tissue morphogenesis, or the formation of tissue shape and structure. They studied the distribution of fluorescently-tagged FGF and its receptor, FGFR, expressed at physiological levels in Drosophila, a fruit fly, and found that F produced in the larval wing imaginal disc moves to the air sac-primord (ASP) through FG-containing cytonemes that extend from ASP to contact the wing disc. The number of F-receiving cyemes by ASP cells decreases with distance from the source, generating a tissue-specific F gradient. F acts as a morphogen in ASP, activating gene expression of pointed1 at higher and cut at lower levels. Transcription factors pointed1 and cut antagonize each other, differentially regulating formation of FG-containing cyemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower F-receiving cyemes. This reveals a mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific contours through feedback regulation of cyeme-mediated dispersion.
Researchers have discovered a new type of protein structure, called the α/β coiled coil, by inserting two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel trimeric coiled coil. This insertion strains the supercoil, causing the formation of short β strands that move 120° around the trimer axis, resulting in a structure that retains only one backbone bond per unit from the parent coiled. This novel structure is possible within the Ramachand space with minor mutations to known folds. α-hel coiled coils are the most understood protein fold, with parametric equations describing their backbone, and have been at forefront of design efforts. However, insertions of 2 and 6 residues, causing greatest strain on α-hical geometry, were not well understood. The α/β coiled is a new class of fiber with alternating α and β-structure, a fold not previously described. It is built of hexads with three in β and three in α regions of the Ramand plot. The first β-layer is a 6-residue element, occurring after position of the hept, biased towards c position as in T and T structures.
Researchers investigated the role of epsin, a conserved endocytic clath adaptor, in clath-mediated endocytosis. They generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional eps triple knockout (KO) mice and observed a dramatic cell division defect and impairment in clath-mediated endocytosis, with accumulation of early, U-shaped pits. This correlated with perturbation of the coupling between the clath coat and actin cytoskeleton, confirmed in a cell-free endytosis assay. The study found that eps helps generate the force leading to invagination and fission of clrin-coated pits through its interaction with SNAREs. Epsin's role in clath-independent endocyt may be linked to actin regulation and its ENTH domain interaction with SNARE synaptobrev 2/VAMP. However, its critical function is at the transition between shallow and invaginated pits.
A case-control study was conducted in Uganda to investigate the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren aged 5-17 years. The study included 555 cases and 111 controls, with asthma diagnosed by clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were:

* Tertiary education for fathers (adjusted OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.71-3.16) and mothers (1.85, 1.38-2.48)
* Area of residence at birth, with children born in small towns or cities having increased risk compared to those born in rural areas (2.16, 1.60-2.92) and (2.79,1.79-4.35) respectively
* Father and mother's history of asthma
* Children's allergic conditions and atopy
* Cooking with gas/electricity

Asthma was associated with a strong rural-city risk gradient, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. The study found that children born in towns and cities had increased risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas, with further increased risk in presence of other factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children's atopy, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. Children born in towns had OR 2.16 (1.60-2.92) and in cities 2.79 (1.79-4.35) compared to rural. The study provides basis for future investigations into environmental and lifestyle factors increasing asthma risk in urban low-middle income countries.
Gap junctions composed of connexins 41.8 and 39.4 are essential for pattern formation in zebraf. Interactions between three pigment cell types are required to form the pattern of adult zebraf (Danio rerio), but their molecular nature is poorly understood. Mutations in leopard (leo), encoding connex 41.8 (Cx.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A dominant allele, leot3, leads to complete loss of pattern, suggesting dominant impact on another component of gap junctions. A genetic screen identified this component as Cx.39.4 (luchs). Loss-function alleles demonstrate luchs required for stripe formation in zraf; however, fins are not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show leo and luchs only in xanthores and melanores but not iridores, suggesting both connins form heteromeric gap junctions. Phenotypes indicate these promote homotyp interactions between melanores xanthores, and cells instruct patterning iridores.

Fish homozygous for leot3 (D) or transhetergous leot3 le1 (E) show identical phenotype of completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanores cluster together are present, mostly with iridores (D and E). Connexin 41.8 depicted positions of mutations.

Researchers investigated the evolution of insect olfactory receptors in three ancient insect species: the wingless bristail Lepismilis signata (Archaeognatha), the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and the neopter leaf insect Phyllium sifium (Phmatodea). They found that the olfactory receptors (OR) and olfactory coreceptor (Orco) are highly lacking in Lepismilis, while Thermobia has three Orco candidates and Phium has a fully developed OR/Or-based system. The study suggests that OR did not evolve as an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle but later in insect evolution, with Or being present before ORs appearance. 

The research focused on neopter insects (order) as most data on insect olfactory receptors are based on studies of these insects. The identity of receptors in olfaction in ancient insects (Archaeogn, Zyoma) and paleer insects (Odon, Ephem) is unknown. The study suggests evolution of Orco after brail split from common ancestor with remaining insects. However, olfactory system relies on OR and Or evolved after emergence of wings. 

Insects provide opportunity to study animals with ancestral characteristics and building blocks of olfaction evolved in insects and other animals. Selected insects at crucial phylogenetic positions with olfactory adapted to terrestrial detection of chemicals. This collection models early evolution of insect olfactory. To address receptors in detection in insects and basal, researchers applied approaches. Neopter (Poly, Par, Hol) most stimuli recognized by OR family. OR multitransmem proteins unrelated vertebrate (Momba, Robertson, Hill).
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the potential herd effect of mass antimalarial drug administration (MDA) on Plasmodium falciparum infections in four villages in Myanmar. The study found that individuals living in neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA compared to those in high-adherence neighborhoods, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito biting rates, living with someone with malaria, or having asymptomatic infection were predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence in villages with high overall participation may hinder elimination efforts.

The study aimed to examine the notion of herd providing additional population protection through MDA, which has been empirically unexplored. Using microepidemiological and spatial data from an M trial in Myanmar, researchers described geographic and epidemiological patterns of clinical and subclinical P. falcum malaria in villages undergoing M. They investigated associations between individual and group participation in M, subinfections, and clinical episodes post-M. This research provides evidence for further intervention and policy.

The study found a group effect from M adherence, suggesting protection evident from three lines of evidence: clinical episodes decreased among all for longer than prophylactic effect of administered antimalials. The site consisted of four villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border in Kayin State, Myanmar, selected based on P. falcum malaria prevalence using ultrasensitive PCR. The villages were part of a M pilot study. falcum episode, adjusting for M adherence and other predictors, having episode. This is the first documentation of herd conferred M for P. falcum malaria. The increase post-M episodes corresponded to increase in HBR
Researchers investigated the conservation of transcription factor (TF) binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution by determining the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs and comparing them to human and mouse data. They found that TF specificities are highly conserved between Drosila and mammals, and for ortholog TFs, the similarity extends to the level of subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. This suggests that evolution of TF specificities contributes to the emergence of novel cell types. A striking conservation of TF specificity was observed, with flies having almost as complex a repertoire of TF motifs as humans. Conservation extended to secondary modes of binding and subtle dinucle preferences, indicating TF specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. To characterize the role of divergence and drift in TF binding specificity in animal diversity, they used HT-LEX to determine TF specificities in Dophila melanogaster. The dataset extends the repertoire of Dila binding specificities by 122 high-resolution motifs and sheds light on new features of Dila DNA-binding TFs. TFs belonging to the same family generally bind similar sites. Dila has many genes orthologous to human genes with conserved DB protein sequences despite diverging 600 years ago. Ortholog TFs have identical DNA profiles, flanking sequences, and modes of binding.
Researchers have developed a novel method to simultaneously direct the differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into both cardiac and lung epithelial lineages, mimicking the interaction between the developing heart and lung during human embryogenesis. This was achieved by temporal tuning WNT and Nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors in 3D culture, resulting in concentric cardio-pulmonary microtissues (μTs). These μTs segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary components upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, initiating cardiac contraction. This model offers an experimentally tractable system for studying cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue formation during embryogenesis.

In 3D culture, cardio-pulmonary μ effectively segregated into cardiac and pulmonary Ts, partially inhibited by W activation. This study provides an in vitro model for the mechanistic interplay between the heart and lung during human embryogenesis. The cardio-p interaction during organogenesis has been documented in the mouse model (Peng et al., 2013; Hoffmann et al.). Upon withdrawal of W agon, cardio-p μ reorganized and segregated into cardiac-only and pulmonary Ts, offering a hiP-based model for cardio-p co-development and tissue during embryogenesis.

Using small molecule cocktails modulating W, nod and T-β signaling in a specific manner, researchers engineered pulmonary-centered cardio-p μTs, demonstrating cardiac lineage as a niche promoting alve maturation. Co-induction of mesod and enderm drove simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from respective-layer progenitors. Transitioning co-cardiac and pulmonary to 3D culture expedited alve mat within days, supported by cardiac lineage.
Researchers have challenged the conventional understanding that mutation rates in organisms are a slowly evolving and strictly regulated parameter by demonstrating an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates in response to changes in selective pressure. Specifically, they found that Escherichia coli cultures adapt to high ethanol stress by evolving hypermutation, a state characterized by increased mutation rates, which is transitory and alternates with decreases in rate once cells are adapted to the stress. The study identified cellular mortality as the major driving force behind the quick evolution of mutation rates, suggesting a balance between robustness and evolvability allows for the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy.

The study used E. coli exposed to high ethanol as a model system, where multiple mutations interact and diverse trajectories lead to adaptation to high concentrations. In addition to the increase in mutation rate, the researchers found hypermut states are transitory and rates decrease once cells are adapted to the stressful environment. The mechanisms underlying these changes in rate remain largely unknown, but the study identified cellular mortality as a major modulator of population rate.

The researchers used a collection of mutators with distinct rates to identify optimal rates for rapid growth under ethanol stress, and experimental evolution revealed an essential role for hypermutation in de novo adaptation to high stress. The findings shed new light on dynamics of mutation evolution and explain why high rates are limited in time.
Researchers have identified a key regulator of the low-energy response in plants, a transcription factor called bZIP63, which is directly targeted by the SnRK kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP by Sn1 changes its dimer preference, affecting gene expression and primary metabolism. A b63 knockout mutant exhibits starvation-related phenotypes, which can be complemented by wild-type b63 but not by a version with mutations in Sn1 target sites. The Sn1 kinase AK10 is responsible for starvation-induced hyperphosphorylation of b63, making it the first TF acting target of Sn1 in transcriptional energy response. b63 phosphorylation at Sn sites is crucial for its function in planta, as shown by complementation of b63 with genomic constructs wt but not S/S mutant. The importance of b63 under stress conditions is underlined by complementation of b63 with wt but not triple mutant. b63 is phosphorylated in vivo in a sugar and energy-dependent manner, with Sn1 identified as one of the kinases responsible, targeting conserved serine residues in N and C-terminus. Overexpression of b63-GFP or -FP in wt and akin backgrounds shows Sn1's role in vivo phosphorylation of b63. Phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for b's dimer and activity in planta, proposing a model for phosphorylation-trigger switch of dimer partners regulating reprogramming.
Researchers have identified a novel protein called Ring finger 10 (RNF10) that acts as a messenger between synapses, the connections between neurons, and the nucleus, the control center of a cell's genetic material. NF10 is activated by signals at the synapse, the point of connection between neurons, and triggers changes at the genetic level. NF is found at excitatory synapses, where it associates with a subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA), a type of receptor. Activation of these receptors and long-term potentiation, a strengthening of neural connections, leads to NF's movement from dendrites, branching extensions of neurons, to the nucleus.

 NF dissociates from the receptor in an activity-dependent manner and is transported to the nucleus through importin, a protein. The receptor's cytoplasmic tail has binding sites for signaling and scaffolding molecules. NF and another protein, calmodulin, share the same binding site. NF represents a novel messenger for lasting changes in dendritic spines, small protrusions of neurons, after specific stimuli and required for long-term potentiation. NF silencing prevents long-term potentiation and structural changes in dendritic spines.

NF is highly expressed in nucleus and synapses, part of the NMD complex and directly interacts with Glu2 subunit's cytoplasmic tail. Activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDs increases NF nuclear localization. This study describes a synapse-nucleus pathway linking synaptic Glu2-containing NMDs to gene expression. NF is highly expressed in nucleus and synapses, part of NMD complex and directly interacts Gl2 sub's cytoplasm tail.
Researchers have elucidated the structural basis for the recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC complex by Mot1, a subunit of the Swi/Snf family of ATPases. These enzymes play a crucial role in regulating chromatin structure and epigenetic state during transcription, DNA replication, and repair. Mot1 serves as a model system for studying Sw/Snf mechanisms. The study reports the crystal structure of Mot's N-terminal domain in complex with TBP, DNA, and transcription cofactor NC2, revealing that Mot reduces DNA:NC interactions and unbends DNA compared to TBP:DNA:NC. This suggests Mot primes TBP:NC displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data show Mot's Sw/Snf domain associates with upstream DNA and histone of NC, similar to nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a framework for Sw/Snf ATPase interaction with DNA:protein complex.

The Sw/S-type ATPases remodel protein:DNA to regulate chromatin structure and epigen state during transcription, replication, and repair. Mot, apart from being essential, serves as a model for structural and mechanistic studies of Sw/S enzymes. Binding Mot leads to subtle conformation changes between substrate and DNA, priming complex for ATP-dependent disruption. The interface between Mot and NC observed in the MotNT:TBP:DNA:2 complex is small, but Mot's insertion could separate NC's main anchor from TBP and DNA. The study provides pseudoatomic structure of Sw/S enzyme bound to protein:substrate and framework for interaction with TBP:DNA:2. Sw/S enzymes remodel complexes by disrupting interface between nucleic and protein partners.

The researchers crystallized E. coli MotNT in complex with TBP, NC, and TATA DNA and present the structure at 3.8 resolution with biochemical, electron, and cross-link studies of full Mot. This provides first pseudo view of Sw/S ATPase in DNA:protein complex. Hydrolysis-dependent translocation of Sw/S domain could provide mechanical force, but question is binding remodel induces conformation in target. Association with T:NC results conformation changes with implications for ATP-dependent dissociation.
Researchers have designed and synthesized variants of the natural product ternatin, a cytotoxic compound with unknown mode of action, and found them to be up to 500-fold more potent against cancer cells. Using a photo-affinity probe, they identified the elongation factor-1 ternary complex (EF1·G·aminoacy-tRNA) as a specific target and demonstrated competitive binding by unrelated products didnin and cyrien. Mutations in domain III of EF1 prevent tern binding and confer resistance to cytotoxic effects, implicating the hydrophobic surface as a functional spot for EF1 modulation. The ternins inhibit protein synthesis with potencies correlate with ability to block proliferation and photo-tern identified EF1 as a target. Surprisingly, photo-tern cross-linked to purified EF1 only in context ternary with G and amino-tRNA. The study aimed to identify the target of cytotoxic product tern, characterized as potent adipogenesis inhibitor. Inspired by partially elucidated structure and cytotoxic cyclic heptapeptide A, compounds 3 and 4 were designed, up to 500 more potent than tern. The binding blocks elongation by mechanism analogous kirromycin, genetic dominance tern sensitivity awaits biochemical studies. Two structurally unrelated products, didnin and ansenin, compete with 5 for EF ternary complex. Four divergent products identified as EF1 inhibitors, ternins may lead medicinal efforts due simplicity and synthesis.
Mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent disease. Although OCRL, a clathin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clath-coated pits, clinical manifestations have primarily been attributed to intracellular defects. This study reveals that OC loss in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts impacts clath-mediated endocyt and results in endytic defect. Cells exhibit accumulation of cl-coated vesicles and increase in U-shaped cl-co pits, resulting from sequestration of coat components on-coated vesicles. Endytic vesicles fail to lose coat majority of numerous actin com present in patient cells. SN9, an adaptor that late-stage endytic-coated pits to act polymer and found to bind OC directly, remains with vesicles. Results indicate OC as unating factor and defects cl-mediated endyt likely contribute to pathology in patients with OC mutations.

In Lowe syndrome fibrobls, absence of OC impairs endyticath coat dynamics and results in defect. Cells accumulate cl-co ves that fail loose. A model depicts impact of lack OC in Lowe patients onath-mediated endyt. Absence 5-phat activity delays endyt by stalls late-stage, impairs unating and triggers nucleation com from-co ves retain P2 and fail uncoat. Ves nucleate least cohort intracellular com previously described Lowe patient (Such and Nuss, 200; Allen,200; Hayes et al,200; Cui et,201; Dambet al,201; Vicanza,201). Findings suggest OC participates unating and facilitates recycling endytic factors, required progression endyt.

Time-lapse microscopy analyzed cl-co dynamics in patient and control cells. Presence Lowe fibrobl numerous com driven-co ves adds support relationship endytic-co and act, topic debate intense, studies subset cl-dependent endytic (Fujimoto,200; Merrield,200,200; Bourot,200; Kaken,200; Tsuj,200).
A novel FAK/PYK/GSKβ216/β-caten regulatory axis has been identified in intestinal tumorigenesis, where FAK and PY2 redundantly promote the Wnt/β-caten pathway by phosphorylating GSKβ216 to reinforce β-caten accumulation and tumorigenesis. FAK and PY2 are elevated in adenomas of APC/+ mice and human colorectal cancer tissues, and their inhibition suppresses adenoma formation in APC/+ mice with reduced phospho-GSK216 and βaten levels. Phospho-GSK216 was higher in APC/+ mice than controls, and PF-271 treatment suppressed G3 phosphorylation and ubiquination. FAK/P2 contributes to APC-driven tumenesis through phosphorylating G216 to promote W/βaten signaling. The study reveals a novel F/PYK/GSK216/βaten circuit in tumenesis, indicating loss of APC induces F and PY2, F phosphorylates G216 to stabilize βaten, initiating and supporting tumen. Phosphorylation of G216 was discovered two decades ago, but mechanisms unclear. To determine F's role in APC tumenesis, the anti-tum effects of F/P inhibitor PF271 in APC/+ mice were examined, a model predisposed to adenomas due to aberrant W/aten signaling. The study shows F and PY redundantly regulate Waten in CRC, raising possibility they function redund in W-driven tumen.
Researchers investigated the neural control of transitions between posture and movement, specifically the regulation of vestibular balance mechanisms, to enable optimal movement. Optimal theory suggests that transitions require disengagement of one motor control before implementation of another. To test this, they examined the continuity of vestibular control during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated locomotion and shifted weight distribution between feet while exposed to vestibular stimuli (EV). The relationship between EV and ground forces was quantified using time-frequency analysis. Discontinities corresponding to coherence were observed preceding movement onset and termination. Results show vestibular balance mechanisms transition between motor states, suggesting discrete change in control, as predicted by optimal theory.

The study examined vestibular contribution to balance control during transitions between standing and locomotion as well as between postures. The vestibular encodes head motion in space and is vital for stability during standing and locomotion. Vestib signals influence activation of muscles in posture control. To transition between states, balance responses are disrupted. Prior to transitions, vestib influence on whole-body responses is suspended. Suspension of vestib-evoked responses at initiation while maintaining upright, before onset (Figures 2, 4, 6). Suppression of balance mechanisms not specific to type, suggesting general process during transitions between standing and motor states. Results demonstrate humans stop balancing before moving and moving before balancing again.

Suspension of vestib-evoked related to sensory gains needed control movements quiet and locomotor policies. During standing, whole accelerations and oscillations within limits small. Adaptive controller (Fitzpatrick et al, 2013; Forbes et al 2017). Vestibular balance locomotor-posture transitions monitored quantifying magnitude vestib-evoked responses over transition. Approach used to monitor engagement disagement vestib balance self-externally states (Lu et 2012).
In cyanobacteria, the transcription factor Rpa is the master regulator of circadian transcription, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpa has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in conditions with alternating light and dark periods. The study investigated mechanisms underlying this viability defect and found that the rpa- strain cannot maintain energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes for carbohydrate utilization at night. Reconstruction of carbon pathways with external carbon source restores energy and viability of the rpa strain in light/dark conditions. The circadian pathway controls and coordinates carbon metabolism to maximize fitness in cells facing periodic energy limitations. 

 Accumulation and utilization of carbon reserves for energy during darkness are defective in the rpa strain, and correction restores viability. Results provide insight into circadian pathway enhancing cyanob fitness through coordination of central metabolism with environmental demands. Circadian output by Rpa is required for anticipatory carbon accumulation and metabolic switching to catabolism at dusk, allowing energy production and viability during darkness. Exposure to darkness restricts energy, creating unique demands in cyanobacteria dependent on sunlight for photosynthesis. The rA strain exhibits defects in growth and viability in cyclic, but not constant environments, suggesting circadian regulation in lightark cycles. Phosphorylated Rpa, regulated by circadian, is critical for coordination anabol and catabism and viability in lightark. Deletion rpa prevents glycogen accumulation and renders unable to utilize glycogen at dusk, leading to energy alterations and reduction in fitness. However, glyc phosphorylase activity in glyc degradation is low in rpa, making scenario less likely. Data support anticipation of periodic limitation one role of cyanob circadian system, output through regulation Rpa temporally coordinates metabolism for darkness demands.
Transition metal ions, such as zinc, are essential micronutrients for organisms but toxic in excessive amounts. Heavy metal transporting P-type (P) ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, conferring detoxification and transport of these ions across cellular membranes. The structure of P-4-ATPases, with the broadest cargo scope, remains elusive. This study presents the structure and functional analysis of archetypal P-4-ATPase, CoT from Sulfitobacter NAS-1. The data disclose architecture devoid of classical heavy-metal binding domains (HMB) and provide new insights into heavy-metal transport mechanism and diversity. Novel P-ATPase features include dual heavy release and internal ion counter histidine. Turnover of P-ATPases is independent of potassium, contrasting other P-ATPases. Combined with inhibitory compounds, results open up efforts for drug discovery, as P-ATPases are virulence factors in pathogens.

P-ATPases are subdivided into groups based on conserved motifs and selectivity towards transition ions. Cu and Zn-transporting P-1 and P-2-ATPases are well-characterized, little known P-4 proteins comprise simplest within P-superfamily. Employed P-4 model CoT (Uni ID3) to shed light on structure and mechanism. Metal specificity of P-ATP is wide, activity assessed in vitro using Baginski assay with different metals. Substances represent leads for drug efforts to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants prevent or enrichment. The structure of P-AT reveals topology, eight helix-domain configuration, no H in members without N-termin.
Researchers have identified a chromatin signature that distinguishes genes with mitotically stable allelic expression (MA) in human cells with high accuracy. This signature consists of chromatin marks associated with active (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3me3) occurring in the gene body. The MA signature is present in approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among developmental genes with bivalent chromatin in pluripotent cells. This approach opens a new avenue to study MA independent of polymorphisms and suggests MA is linked to cell differentiation.

Applying this approach to various cell types, up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin of MA. Detection of MA does not rely on SNPs or sample clonality, making it feasible for analysis in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. Among widely expressed genes, about 20 have chromatin characteristic MA in at least one tissue. Genes with tissue-specific expression as a group, estimate 39-48 have MA pattern. MA identified in clones is reflected by chrom in polycl sample.

To test chromatin as predictor of MA state, genes with MA pattern were assessed allelic in monoclonal lines. Calculated gene-body signal for H3me and H3me for autosomal Ref genes on ENCODE ChIP data GM78 lymphoblast cells. A large fraction of bivalent (>80) acquire MA chromatin in least differentiated types, higher compared to silent in ES. Upon activation, master genes preferentially resolve into MA chromatin.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism of control for the AAA+ chaper Clp, a protein essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance, which is widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria. They found that coiled-coil domains in Clp control its activity by sequestering Clp molecules in an inactive state. This is the first time coiled-coil domains have been shown to regulate AAA+ protein activity. Clp has a coiled middle domain (MD) consisting of two wings, forming a repressing belt around the ring to reduce ATPase activity. Adjacent MDs bind each other by head-to-tail interactions, keeping regulatory domains in place. ATP repression is relieved by MD dissociation and binding to Hsp adaptors that prevent reassociation of MD with Clp/Hsp ring. This is similar to other AAA chaper systems, where adaptors select substrates and regulate ATPase activity and deliver substrates to ATPase activation. Control requires ATPase to be repressed in ground state, key to AAA chaper mode of action. Repression can be achieved by coiled domains inserted into AAA module. Clp MD form intermolecular head-head contacts, docking two Clp layers in helical conformation. Formation involves ATP binding to AAA domains. This Clp assembly is inactive, restricting substrate binding, ClP and adaptor proteins, and no efficient hydrolysis. Mutating key MD residue ClE causes cellular toxicity, suggesting repress mode of MD operational in ClE and ClL, a general mechanism for bacterial AAA chaper systems. Severe Cl and ClE mutants qualify AAA chaper as antimicrobials.
Researchers used the fruit fly Drosila model to study the behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMP), a type of stem cell that remains dormant during most of larval life but proliferates to provide muscle cells for adult growth and regeneration. They found that AMPs extend filopodia, thin extensions that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting muscles play a role in AMP reactivation. Genetic analysis showed muscles send inductive signals that activate the insulin pathway in AMP, leading to Notch activation, which regulates AMP proliferation via dyc. The study reveals a niche-driven insulin-Notch-dyc cascade plays a key role in AMP reactivation, similar to findings in vertebrates. Dyc acts as a positive regulator of AMP reactivation, and genetic experiments show Not acts downstream of insulin and dyc downstream of Notch.
Researchers investigated the molecular basis of spontaneous firing in substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN) neurons, a major output of the basal ganglia, which provides tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas. They used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual SN neurons and found that they express the sodium channel NAL. SN neurons lacking NAL had impaired firing. NAL is also involved in modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The study suggests disruption of NAL could impair basal gang circuitry underlying severe motor deficits in humans with NAL mutations. 

The researchers identified the nonselective cation channel (NS) supporting SN firing and determined the molecular of glycolysis NS. Single-cell sequencing found the gene profile of SN and relative levels of NSCs. Sodium channel NAL was highest expressed in SN neurons. The molecular basis of current is crucial for investigation of properties and regulation of SN inhibition of basal targets. To address this, they performed transcript sequencing of SN and detected expression of NS that could generate depolar current. They found SN express NAL, a prime candidate for carrying depolar current in cells. SN require NAL for tonic firing, suggesting NAL could contribute to basal gang related disorders. Disruption of normal firing by G receptor agonists leads to muscle tension and dystonia. Hyperactivity of SN observed in Parkinsonian animals. NAL stood as candidate for depolar current, highest of all NSCs and in top 20 of all channels. SN express Unc, Unc, and Fam, genes interacting with NAL.
Researchers have developed a novel method to cultivate and screen for antibiotic-producing microorganisms from complex microbial communities using a droplet-based microfluidic system. This approach increases the throughput and sensitivity of traditional cultivation methods, allowing for the growth of previously uncultured species and a higher bacterial diversity compared to standard agar plate cultivation. The system consists of miniaturized droplets, each containing a single cell, which can be stored and incubated under controlled conditions, providing a genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products. A high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity is achieved by adding reporter strains to the droplets. The combination of in-dro cultivation with subsequent selection of promising candidates through a robust assay streamlines efforts towards new antibiotic development.

A study verified the strategy by culturing a soil-derived bacterial community on a substrate and comparing it to agar cultivation. One isolate showed antimicrobial activity in the droplet screening, and its secreted metabolites were identified. The droplets can be stored and incubated in bulk, allowing large populations to be generated under aerobic conditions. A high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products was implemented using reporter strains in droplets. The approach was combined with a step to detect and select droplets containing cells producing compounds with antibiotic activity.

An innovative cultivation strategy was devised using a modular dro-microfluid platform mimicking environmental conditions. Miniaturized droplets of 200pL enabled long-term cultivation of 2 million cells in 1.5mL. Screening for production was achieved by adding reporter strains to compartments. The approach was combined with a step to detect and select droplets containing cells producing compounds with activity. Although axenic cultures of new species could not be maintained after isolation, cells were used for high-quality genome information.
Researchers conducted a Bayesian analysis to investigate the association between the leukotriene A hydrolase (L4) genotype and survival in tuberculous meningitis patients. Tuberculous meningitis has high mortality linked to excessive inflammation, but adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids only reduce mortality by 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes a subset of deaths. In Vietnam, the benefit of anti-inflammatory corticoids was most pronounced in patients with C/T variant in the L4 gene, encoding an enzyme regulating inflammatory eicosoids. L4 TT patients with increased expression had survival, consistent with corticoids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, an Indonesia study did not find L4 TT survival benefit. Using Bayesian methods to analyze both studies, researchers found L TT genotype confers survival that begins early and continues long-term in both populations, nullified in most cases with high mortality. L4 genotyping with disease assessment may target glucortic therapy to most likely benefit.

The study supported that mortality from TB was due to two inflammatory states, and L genotype might be critical of inflammation and response to adjunct anti-treatment. If true, personalized glucocortic treatment would be warranted, given to TT patients. A form of dysregulation might be caused by genetic uniquely present in Indonesia, through inflammatory pathway less responsive to dexamethas. The TT effect was thought limited to severe in both cohorts because Indonesia was skewed towards severe presentation, association overridden by disease, independent of mortality. The beneficial of dethasone to TT may not have time to play in Grade Indonesia. A possibility that Grade presented greater dysregulation not by standard metrics judging severity, cortoids no longer beneficial. However, Indonesia presented more disease and died, postulated rather than invoking phenomenon, beneficial deth for TT nullified more disease.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism by which axonal growth cones navigate and decide their migratory direction in response to guidance cues. They found that knockout mice lacking the protein Shoot1 display abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, a similar to the phenotype of axon guidance molecule Netrin-1. The study shows that Netrin-1 elicits polarized phosphorylation of Shoot1 within growth cones, which increases interaction with cell adhesion molecule L-CAM, promoting force generation for growth cone migration. Spatially regulated phosphorylation of Shoot1 within cones is required for axon turning by Netrin gradients. The study defines a mechano-effector for Netrin signaling and demonstrates Shoot1 phosphorylation as a readout for Netrin gradients resulting in directional axon guidance.

The study demonstrates that Shoot1, through spatially regulated phosphorylation within cones, mediates the reading and mechresponse of Netrin-induced axon guidance. Shoot1 is expressed at high levels in developing brain commiss axons, and knockout mice display abnormal guidance of these axons, similar to Netrin knockout. Small differences in Netrin concentration elicit highly polar directional phosphorylation of Shoot within cones. Netrin-elicited Shoot phosphorylation promotes interaction between Shoot and L-C, generating force for cone motility. Disturbance of spatial Shoot phosphorylation within cones inhibits ax turning but not outgrowth induced by Netrin gradients. Uncoupling F-act-adhesion by Shoot(1-125) inhibits Netrin-induced outgrowth and on lamin.
Researchers investigated the humming sound produced by hovering hummingbirds, also known as their "humming," and found that it originates from the oscillating aerodynamic forces generated by their flapping wings. To study this, they used a 217-microphone array to record the acoustic field around six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds and a new aerodynamic platform to measure the 3D forces exerted on the birds. They developed an idealized model that integrates aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics, showing that the timbre of the humming arises from oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. Comparing birds and insects, they found that the characteristic timbre and radiated power of flapping wings comes from harmonics in aerodynamic forces supporting body weight. Their analysis across birds and insects shows allometric makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, clarifying bioacoustic behavior.

The researchers combined aerodynamic platform and microphone recordings in vivo to determine how flapping wings generate unsteady aerodynamic forces and acoustic signature. The platform integrates steady and unsteady pressure around the bird three times wing frequency, associated with net 3 forces. To resolve oscillating aerodynamic generated by flapping, they developed a new platform to measure net 3 forces generated by hoveringbirds, integrating data in a new aeroacoustics to predict sound due oscillating forces. In vivo 3D force and kin measurements are corroborated through near acoustic holography, showing hummingbirds generate directional hum. Broadband pressure is oriented downward, directivity harmonic components depend on parity.

The model assumes rigid wings, neglecting effects such as flutter, whistle, and turbulent dynamics. Comparing predicted field with recordings for six hummingbirds, corroborates the model's predictive power. Findings point to oscillating forces generating hum. Numerical simulation of Fow Williams and Hawk aeroequation showed far hum driven by aerodynamic fluctuation. Despite advances, vivo near-field measurements lacking.
Researchers investigated the roles of chance and necessity in the evolution of ancestral proteins by reconstructing and evolving the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein family. They used a combination of ancestral protein reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins to acquire protein-protein interaction specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from ancestral proteins, they found that contingency generated over historical timescales erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of sequence variation. Trajectories from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded virtually no mutations, even under strong identical selection pressures. Chance arose many mutations could alter specificity at any point, while contingency arose historical substitutions changed these.

The study suggests present-day B-2 proteins and potentially others are largely anecdotal products of their unpredictable histories, reflecting accumulated events during descent with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and selection. The authors found contingency generated sequence over phylogen times plays a role in B-2 protein evolution under selection for new functions. They used B and NO as binding partners, but during evolution varied, introducing opportunities for chance and contingency to affect outcomes. Differences in design and biological B- evolution may have overestimated chance's historical role.

Results indicate paths leading to specificities changed during B- history, even when profiles did not evolve. For chance to influence outcomes, multiple paths must be accessible with similar probabilities.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide haplotype analysis on a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups to investigate the structure of genetic diversity and gene flow in the region. They found that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 700 years, and Eastern and Southern-Niger-C speaking groups share ancestry with Central Africans as a result of recent expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups outside their current region due to gene flow within the last 400 years. The study provides insight into haplotype sharing across ethno-linguistic groups and movement of alleles into new environments, relevant to genetic epidemiology studies. 

The researchers used a sample of 18 ethnic groups from eight countries in the African Genome Variation Project to describe the influence of Eurasian and hunter-gather ancestry on sub-Saharan population history and movement of alleles and haplotes. However, the extent and timing of key events and their impact on contemporary populations remain unclear. Inferred groups reflect broad geographic patterns at finer scales, analysis reveals smaller groups and differentiates closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry. Gene flow between populations is related to historical movements into and within sub-Saharan. Admixture occurs when ancestral groups mix, a common in human populations globally. Genome analyses refine previous models of Africa's history and impact on diversity.
Researchers investigated how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell size during Xenopus lae embryogenesis. They established an in vitro system using cytoplasm extracts from embryos that recapitulated spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37µm) and stage 8 (∼400 cells,18m). The kines-13 kif2 was identified as a driver of spindle scaling, whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by transportin α, and activated in stage 8 when import α partitions to membrane. Altering spindle size in embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Spindle size in Xenopus is coupled to cell size through a rati mechanism controlling microtub destabilization.

The researchers reconstituted spindle formation in embryo extracts to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle with size during X lae development through differential activation of kines-13 k2. A number of perturbations have been shown to alter spindle size, but this study identified hundreds of spindle associated proteins that operate to scale during embryogenesis. Advantage was taken of this mechanism to modify spindle without perturbing spindle, uncovering an important role in spindle maintaining orientation in large cells of Xenopus. This suggests physical features of cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical redistribution of activities. This is consistent with gradual change from meiotic to mitotic morphology during mouse development, suggesting physical changes can impact biochemical reactions altering architecture (Couris et al, 2012).

Import α phosphorylation is thought to liberate from membrane into cytoplasm, promoting transport (Hach et al,2004). Correcting nonspecific binding, k2ΔLS was used to find k2 could retrieve ∼ times import α from stage 3 extracts than stage 8. This suggests amount of α partitioning to membrane is sufficient to alter interaction with k2. Identification of mechanism enabled testing significance during development. Observations suggest changes spindle pathways accompany size and could influence size. An embryo system was created to assemble spind in cytoplasm at any stage Xe up midblast transition when divisions become asynchronous (Newport and Kner,198).
Researchers have discovered a type of RNA molecule called riboswitches that can function as a Boolean logic gate to control purine metabolism in bacteria. These molecules can bind to specific ligands, such as phosphoribosylrophosphate (PR) and guanine, and regulate the expression of genes involved in purine biosynthesis. The ribwitches can exist as single units or in tandem arrangements, allowing them to function as a two-input logic gate. The guanine-PR ribwitch can bind to both ligands separately or together to control the expression of messenger RNA for purine biosynthesis. This discovery supports the idea that ancient RNA-based organisms could have managed complex metabolic processes without protein factors. 

The study examined the aptamer regions of the RNA and found that the logic function of the tandem ribwitch is due to interactions between the aptamers and the expression platform. The terminator and antitermin stems are stabilized or destabilized depending on the concentrations of guanine and PR. This is the first example of tandem apters with different ligand specificities sharing the same expression platform, allowing a new type of logic to be implemented. The RNA systems demonstrate complex sensing and regulatory functions, reflecting the complexity of metabolite monitoring and regulation in ancient RNA organisms. It is likely that additional two-input logic gates will be represented by ribwitches yet to be discovered in modern cells. 

PR was used by RNA organisms to generate building blocks of biopolymer, and apters that bound biosynthetic precursor might have persisted as ribwitches in modern cells. The discovery of tandem gu-PR ribwitch demonstrates complex devices can be formed purely from RNA. The in vitro data represent combined output of RNA transcripts.
Researchers have investigated the variability in the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential, which affects the reliability of synaptic transmission. They found that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily releasable pool, rather than the probability of vesicle release. This pool is controlled by protein kinase A and its target synapsin, which dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. This discovery defines mechanisms that control multivesicular release and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.

The study used mouse brain slices to demonstrate that the number of vesicles is determined by the size of the readily releable pool, upstream of vesicle probability. This contradicts the prevailing view that release of single (unives release, UVR) or multiple vesicles (multives release, MVR) reflects variability in ves release probability, which is supported by calcium dependence of release mode. Diversity in calcium homeostasis and protein kinase A may contribute to variability in PK and synapsin regulation across synapses. Recent models propose vesicles transition between states from loose to tighter tethering with release followed by calcium-triggered fusion, akin to transitions from sites to docking prior fusion.

Multives release is widespread in the rodent CNS and dominant in human cortex, yet some synapses are limited to release of single vesicle per zone, termed unives release. Synapses switch modes in activity-dependent manner. The number of vesicles from active zone is product of ves release probability and number of ves available. The simplest explanation is that readily releable pool is functional number of release-competent ves per zone, under synins control, constraining number released.
Researchers have reconstituted the selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA in vitro using a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 G and giant unilellar vesicles. They found that HIV-1 G selectively packages dimer, unliced viral RNA in the presence of excess cytosolic RNAs by assembling on the plasma membrane. Mutations in the CACT domain of G, which affect self-assembly of G, abrogated RNA selectivity. They also found that tRNA suppresses G membrane binding when G has bound viral RNA. The ability of HIV-1 G to package its genome and self-assembly on membranes are interdependent. A model for HIV-1 genome selection was proposed where the NC of G is necessary but not sufficient for selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA. The study highlights the importance of membrane-localized G assembly in HIV-1 genome and packaging.
