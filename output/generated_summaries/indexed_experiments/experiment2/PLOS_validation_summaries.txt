Researchers conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblast cells from genetically distinct human individuals to investigate the role of RNA 3'-end processing in gene regulation. They mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3 gene ends and found that transcript positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions, but preferentially flanked locations of 3 regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. The usage of transcript forms and motifs varied across individuals, and polymorphisms in polyaden signals and 3 motifs were significant predictors of expression of genes. Single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyaden variants on steady-state expression and validated regulatory function of 3 cis elements. Focusing on IR5, they established the effect of variation on response to antigen stimulation. The study highlights the importance of mechanisms in genetics of 3-end variation: usage of distinct 3- signals and effects of 3 elements that determine transcript fate. The findings suggest integrating 3 positions with 3 motifs will be a tool in continued efforts to interpret human variation. The relationship between sequence and expression did not manifest for mi sites, highlighting the relevance of 3 motifs as predictors across individuals when integrated with transcript forms. The study validates genome analyses and speculates many variants biologically mediated by 3-end remain to be discovered. Polymorphisms in 3 that govern fate can serve predictors of steady levels of genes.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of the SIVΔne vaccine, a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine that provides strong protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. They used deep sequencing and CD8 cell epitope mapping to analyze the CD8 T cell response, identifying regions of immune pressure and viral escape, and the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD T cell response in SIVne-vaccinated animals. The study found that the initial CD8 cell response in the acute phase of SIVne infection targeted variable epitopes, followed by widespread viral sequence evolution and escape. Epitope escape expanded the CD8 cell repertoire to target conserved epitopes, defined anropic specificity, and generated de novo responses to escaped variants during vaccination. These results correlated SIVne-induced protection with anropic specificity and increased response depth. The study demonstrated rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of CD8 cell responses to conserved epitopes in SIVne infection, as well as de novo CD8 cell responses to escaped variants during chronic infection. SIV-specific CD8 cell responses were maintained as central memory CD cells, contributing to the cumulative breadth of the CD8 response at 20 weeks post-vacc with SIVne. Epitope escape and de novo CD8 responses to variants deepened the CD repertoire. High-throughput sequencing quantified SIVne variants and frequencies in vaccinated animals, including undetectable viral loads, and fine-mapped CD8 responses at epitope at 5 and 20 weeks postacc. Longitudinal study of vaccinated animals showed concurrent evolution of virus and CD8 specificity, resulting in a CD8 repertoire with anropic, wider breadth, rearranged immunodance, and enhanced depth.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the immune response to Candida albicans infections in the oral mucosa using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis. They found that IL-1 receptor (IL-R) signaling is critical for controlling the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels: recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and mobilization of newly generated neutils from the bone marrow. IL-1 deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in circulation in response to C. albicans. Endothelial cells were identified as the primary source of G-CS during OPC, responding to IL-α released from keratinocytes in infected tissue. A link between IL-1 and granopoies was established in vitro using a murine-derived kerocyte line and endothelial cell line. Two mechanisms coordinating neutil response in oral mucosa were identified, crucial for preventing fungal growth and dissemination and protecting the host from disease.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filari (GPE) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 570 million individuals via mass administration of anti-filar drugs (albendazole, iverectin, diethylbamazine) in at-risk areas for 4-6 years. The economic benefits of this achievement were quantified by calculating the number of clinical manifestations averted and associated with disease prevention in the context of direct costs, indirect labor, and healthcare for affected individuals. Estimated US$21.8 billion in economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million treated during the first 8 years of GPE, with US$2.3 billion from protection of nearly 3 million newborns and individuals from acquiring lymphatic filari as a result of being born in areas of transmission. Additionally, 28 million already infected with LF benefit from GLF halting progression, resulting in US$19.5 billion lifetime benefit. At-risk individuals decreased services with LF morbidity save health systems approximately US$2.2 billion. The Programme offers significant economic benefits, with favorable implementation largely due to donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry, indicating a high return on investment.
Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal disorder, is caused by homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, leading to decreased enzymatic activity of glucerebrosidase (GCase) and accumulation of its substrates, glucerebroside and glucosylsphosine. The study generated GBA mutant medaka, completely deficient in GCase activity, to investigate how G mutations cause Parkinson's disease (PD). Contrary to perinatal death in humans and mice lacking G activity, GBA medaka survived months, enabling analysis of pathological progression. G med displayed neuronopathic phenotypes, including Ga cell infiltration into brains, progressive neuronal loss, and gliosis. Detailed findings revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-syn accumulation in axonal swellings autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disruption of alpha-s did not improve lifespan, axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflamm in G medaka. The study revealed G med as a neuronopathic model, pathological mechanisms alpha-s caused by G deficiency, and minimal contribution alpha-s to pathogenesis neuronopathic.
Listeria monocytogen, a facultative intracellular pathogen, induces a robust cell-mediated immune response upon subthal infection. However, its ability to escape the phagosome and enter the host cytos is crucial for induction of long-lived CD8 T cell-mediated immunity. Research shows that impaired T response to L monocogen confined within phag is not due to inefficient antigen presentation, but direct suppression of the adaptive response. This suppression affects not only adaptive response to vacu-confined L monocogen but negates response within cytos. Co-infection with phosome-conf and cytos L monocogen prevents acquired immunity and expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to cytos L monocogen. Bacteria confined phag suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines and rapid MyD-dependent IL-10 production. Block IL-10 receptor or MyD during infection restored immunity. Studies demonstrate microbes within phosome impact innate and adaptive response by antagonizing inflammation and CD8 cell generation pathways.
A recent genome-wide association study identified a significant link between primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and the SIX locus, with an odds ratio of 1.32 and a p-value of 3.87 x 10^-11. The SIX gene plays a role in ocular development and has been associated with the morphology of the optic nerve. Researchers sequenced the SIX coding and regulatory regions in 262 PO cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous variants, including five rare and one variant AsnHis (rs12345), which was associated with PO in the NEIGH/GLUG datasets. These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complement assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye and optic structure. Five variants, primarily in PO cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth, found in controls, was benign. One variant in the SIX enhancer increased expression SIX and disrupted its regulation. The study found a clinical feature in PO patients dependent on SIX genotype: those homozygous for the SIX risk allele (His) have a thinner retinal nerve layer than homozyg for the non-risk (As) allele. The results, combined with previous SIX work, suggest SIX variants disrupt the development of the retina, leading to reduced retinal ganglion cells, increasing glcoma vision loss.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch, known as the "flagellar switch," that controls the production of flagella and glucosyl toxins in the human pathogen Clostridium difficile. The flag switch is a 154-base pair invertible sequence flanked by 21-base pairs of inverted repeats and is located upstream of the flB operon, which contains early flagellar genes. When the flag switch is in the "ON" orientation, bacteria produce flagella and secrete toxins, while in the "OFF" orientation, they are attenuated for flagellar gene expression and toxin secretion. The orientation of the switch is reversible in vitro and occurs post-transcriptionally, requiring a C. difficile-specific factor to destabilize or degrade early flagellar mRNA. The tyrosine recombinase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at cwp switch, is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. The flag switch affects transcription of toxin genes via σD, impacting glucyl toxin production and cytotoxicity of C. difficile. RecV also controls variation of cell wall protein cV and is the recombinase for inversion at flagellar in both directions. Flagellar ON bacteria and recV mutants with flag switch in ON display perich flagella, swim and produce glucyl toxins, while flag OFF and rec mutants with switch in OFF are attenuated for flagellar transcription and toxin production.
Researchers investigated the sporulation pathway in Clostridium difficile, an obligate anaerobic pathogen that relies on endospores for its infectious cycle. They studied the four cell-specific RNA polymerase sigma factors σF, σ, σE, σ, and σK, which control gene expression during spore development in Bacillus subtilis, and found deviations from the B. subtilis paradigm. While the main periods of activity of the factors are conserved, σE activity is partially independent of σF, σ activity is not dependent on σ, and σ activity does not require σK. σ is not strictly required for heat spore formation. The results indicate reduced temporal segregation between early and late sigma factors and reduced requirement for σ-to-σ, σ-to-σ, and σ-to- cell signaling. The study supports the view that the sporulation network is conserved in evolution, with sigma factors acting as key regulators established 2.5 billion years ago at the base of Firmic Phylum.
Researchers have developed a framework to model the behavior of allosteric multisite proteins using a single variable, which closely replicates the steady-state behavior of multisite systems such as the Monod-Wy-Change alloster model. This framework is useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems where multis proteins interact simultaneously. They applied this tool to a newly discovered checkpoint pathway in yeast, which monitors cell growth by signals at the plasma membrane. The pathway's components form a hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to growth, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-no response when the signal reaches a threshold indicating sufficient growth. The model assumes a protein is activated by phosphorylation of several, but not all, sites, becoming increasingly precise with more sites, with good estimates for four or more. This mechanism is a one-variable, quasi-stead state reduction of the Mon-WChange alloster system. Multisite phosphorylation can give ultrasensitive responses, not possible in single-site systems. The framework can be extended to other types of multis modification, such as ligand binding, transcription, methylation, acetylation, or ubiquination. A mechanistic model of a cell checkpoint was described, assuming sequential phosphorylation by a kinase and dephosphorylation by a phosphat, with different phosphforms and large number of sites.
Researchers employed a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches to investigate the quorum sensing (QS) system in E. coli, specifically the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signaling pathway. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of genetic "switch" phenomena, which enable bacterial populations to communicate and gain a selective advantage. The researchers separated the network into sub-networks to examine negative and positive feedback mechanisms, discovering a new negative feedback interaction and revealing the importance of the Lsr regulator in the E. coli QS "switch. A simple model was developed to understand the interplay among regulatory substructures and their contributions to the native network. This "bottom-up" approach will unravel complex QS architectures and lead to emergent behaviors. 

The AI-2 QS system in E. coli consists of an auto-regulatory network with a double negative motif, providing a population-based response. The researchers studied network connectivity and signal propagation of AI-2, constructing mutant strains to represent the system as a complete network. Analysis of this architecture shed light on regulatory pathways within bacterial metabolic networks, guiding new phenotypes and biotechnological applications. A model was built incorporating the new element, capturing predictions and simulating the intact and sub-systems. The mechanistic basis for Lsr-mediated "switch" of E. coli circuit was revealed, buried in the native system but effective.
In a study conducted in rural Gabon, researchers investigated the effect of Schistosoma haematob infection on Plasmod falcum infection in school-age children. The study found that Schosias increased the risk of Plmod infection, especially when combined with Trichuris trichi or hookworm infection. The incidence of malaria was higher in Schos-infected children compared to non-infected, with a significant delay in time-to-malaria event in children aged 6-10 years. Results suggest STH enhances risk for P falcum in Schos-positive children, and Schos enhances susceptibility to malaria in young children but not older. The study highlights the need to consider STH and schosias control in malaria programs in areas where both infections are endemic.
Researchers investigated the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donovani infection. IRF-5 is responsible for activating genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TN. The study found that IRF-5-induced inflammation limits CD8+ cell expansion and induces HIF-1 in dendritic cells. Ablation of H-1 in dendritic cells resulted in higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8 cells, enhanced CD+ cell expansion, and increased IL-12 expression by splenic DCs. Mice with targeted H-1 in dendritic cells had lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting H-1 induction may be an immune evasive mechanism by Leish to establish infection. IR-5 is involved in transcriptional activation of Type I IF genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. IR-/- mice showed IR- essential for protective Th1 responses. CD+ cell depletion caused mild increase in parasite burden in Cre mice, while CD+ cells controlled parasite growth in H- conditional mice, indicating H- in DC responsible for limiting CD+ responses. H- induction in DC represents immune mechanism by Leish to establish chronic infection.
A systematic review of 14 studies conducted in Latin America on prognostic factors for adverse outcomes in American visceral leishmanias (VL) identified jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and >40 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, bacterial infections, edema, and low hemoglobin concentration as predictors of unfavorable outcomes. These factors were determined through meta-analysis of variables grouped by strength of evidence, heterogeneity of effect sizes, and multivariate analyses. Leishmanias-HIV coinfection was a significant prognostic factor for adverse evolution, with coinfected individuals having higher risk of poor outcomes. The review highlights the need for development of externally validated prognostic models, as current models lack validation. The Brazilian Ministry of Health recommends platelet transfusion for VL patients with counts <10,000 platelets/mm3. The lack of reduction in fatality rates in Brazil is attributed to therapy limitations, diagnosis delay, and inadequate management of high-risk individuals. Identification of prognostic factors is a valuable tool for clinical practice. Undernutrition is not a risk factor for severity, but rather a consequence of wasting in VL, and Leish replication control by Th1 cells in undernourished patients explains the lack of association.
Researchers in Algeria investigated the susceptibility of Leishmania isolates to antimony over a 30-year period. The study aimed to determine the level of antimony susceptibility amongst Leish transmitted in Algeria, which is crucial for public health policy development. A total of 106 isolates were analyzed, including 88 collected between 1976-2013 from humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines, and 18 from dogs in France. The 50 inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of antimony tartrate (Sbivalent) and sodium stibogluconate (pentavalent) were determined in promastigotes and intramacroph amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff (EFCO) allowed differentiation between Leish species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmanias susceptible (S) or insusceptible (S) to trivalent antimony was determined. The IC50 values were 23.83μg/mL and 15.91μg for VL and CL, respectively. A trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in VL isolates was observed during the 30-year period, in contrast to an increase in frequency S-phenotypes in CL isolates. The emergence of S-phenotypes correlated with L. kili (L. trop) isolates causing cutaneous leishias that emerged in Algeria during the last decade. The study provides insight into spatiemporal dynamics of Leish antimony in Algeria, highlighting the need for effective methodology to determine susceptibility to detect emergence and prevent dissemination of drug-resistant strains.
Researchers investigated the relationship between acute gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition of unknown etiology. They developed two models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimium or Citrobacterium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia (AIE), a pathion linked to CD. The study found that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis was driven by the tissue expansion of the AIE pathion, with an increase in immunology defects, barrier, and delays in mucosal restitution following path clearance. These features required AIE resistance to host peptides and amin inflammatory response to enteric path. The results suggest that individuals colonized by AIE at the time of infectious gastroenter may be at risk for CD onset. The study also identified AIE as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of interventions following infectious gastroitis at-risk individuals.
In flowering plants, the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg and central cell, flanked by five accessory cells, all of which are vital for fertilization. However, the mechanisms underlying the formation of gametic versus accessory cell fate are unknown. A screen for regulators of egg cell fate isolated the lach (lis) mutant, which forms supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate gametic fate, indicating LIS is involved in a mechanism preventing accessory cells from adopting gametic fate. Temporal and spatial of LIS expression suggest this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homolog to yeast splicing factor PR4, indicating components of splice apparatus participate in cell decisions. The lis mutant reveals two levels of cell regulation, between gametic and accessory, and between egg and central cells. The initiation of cell-specific genes indicates Arabid distinct fates only after cellular formation.
A qualitative study was conducted in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoiosis, a neglected tropical disease caused by exposure to irritant soils, to explore the role of footwear in disease prevention. Using the PRECE-PRO model, social, behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors influencing shoe-wearing were assessed. 242 respondents participated in focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and case studies. Results showed shoeearing norms were changing, with going barefoot seen as shameful, and shoes conferring dignity and protection against injury and cold. However, practical and social barriers prevented desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice. Limited resources meant people could not purchase more than one pair, ensuring longevity or afford quality shoes. As a result, shoes were preserved for special occasions and not provided for children until a certain age. Underlying barriers related to poverty, such as price, unsuitability, and low perception, are likely relevant to range of NTDs. Established models of health behavior adoption identified barriers amenable to intervention, anticipated to benefit NTD prevention through shoe distribution.
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsid and glycoproteins to axons of infected sympathetic neurons, with Us null mutants defective in anterograde transmission in vivo. The mechanism of Us-mediated axonal sorting of viral proteins is unclear. Glycoproteins B, C, D, and E are associated with lipid rafts on infected cells and directed into axons in Us-dependent manner. This study determined Us association with lipid rafts critical for Us-mediated sorting of structural proteins. Non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a ratheochromocytoma line acquiring sympathetic neuron characteristics in NGF, showed Us enriched detergent-resistant membranes (DR). Reducing Us affinity for lipid rafts inhibited antograde transmission from neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. Us association with rafts key for targeting proteins axons, directional spread PR from pre-synaptic to postynaptic neurons mammalian nervous system.
Researchers investigated the genetic heterogeneity in growth rate and stress tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model organism that exhibits phenotypic variation under constant conditions. They found that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein A (PKA) pathway and its transcription factors M2 and M4 underlies this heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, shown by direct comparison of c concentration in subpopulations enriched for slower and faster cells. An endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. Paralogs M2 and M4 differ in roles in heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress are not linked. Heterogeneity in rate requires M2, whereas M4 is required for heterogeneity expression of T1, subunit trehalose synth that contributes to acute-stress. Perturbing heterogeneity by mutating genes in pathway or culturing wild-type with cell-perable cAMP 8romoAMP or PK inhibitor H89 impacts survival acute stress. Perturbations increase c levels reduce slower subpopulation and increase susceptibility heat, whereas PK slows growth and decreases susceptibility. Loss M2 reduces but not eliminates correlation individual between rate and stress, suggesting major role M2 in heterogeneity but residual slow growth.
Researchers conducted a whole-genome sequencing analysis of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) from the 2013 outbreak in the Caribbean to understand its evolutionary genomic elements. CHV, an alphavirus and member of the Togaviridae family, caused severe febrile disease in humans and rapidly spread from Asia to the Americas. The study analyzed viral diversity in infected individuals from Guadelou and Martinique, two islands in the epicenter of the epidemic, using deep-sequencing and bioinformatics. Changes in consensus and minority variants were observed at various levels, with reduced diversity after single passages in cell lines. An infectious clone was constructed and a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure, not found in nature, was identified, leading to increased replication in insect cells. Intrahostasis analysis of the new CHV outbreak in the Caribbean revealed novel variants and a new 3'UTR, suggesting rapid evolution in a short time. The study highlights the need for continued viral surveillance to understand CHV's evolutionary potential.
Researchers have identified a previously unannotated gene, UOR, as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. UOR depletion in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC cells promotes neurite outgrowth, while UOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies in cells revealed UOR stabilizes DEOR, a component of the mTOR complex, to inhibit m signaling. In zebraf models, UOR disruption upregulates m signaling and promotes HRAS (12) mediated tumor formation. UOR stabilizes DEOR and regulates DE's ubiquitination, while U disruption increases m activity and aggravates HR (12) neoplas in animals. UOR depletion promotes growth and m signaling in xenograft mice. UOR is an unannot gene present in vertebrates, encoding a protein without known domains. UOR depletion promotes growth in HEK and UMG cells, while overexpression suppresses colony in HE and T cells. UOR reduction promotes m signaling. U interacts with DEOR and m complexes. UOR depletion promotes growth and m in xenograft.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of protein interactions in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, responsible for African trypanosomiasis. Using biochemical fractionation, they identified 128 high-confidence complexes involving 716 proteins, including 635 with unknown functions. The map correlates with known pathways and co-expressed proteins across the parasite's life cycle, providing potential functions for uncharacterized proteins. Novel proteins associated with RNA editing machinery were validated, including a candidate involved in post-transcriptional regulation. This study presents the largest proteomics interaction map of tryosid parasites to date, providing a resource for new hypotheses and experimental leads. The map was used to reveal factors in post-transcription regulation of T bruce, validated by independent experiments.
Researchers studied the dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in lymph nodes (LNs) of macaques, focusing on thoracic LNs, which are commonly infected in humans. They analyzed PET scans, bacterial burden, and immune function of LNs in M-infected cynolgus andhes macques and found that LNs have different trajectories of increasing or decreasing activity over time within the same animal. Rhes macques are more susceptible to M infection than cynolg macques due to extensive LN pathology. Mtb grows to the same level in cynolg andhes mac LNs, but cynolg macques control M at later points post-infection while rhes macques do not. Granulomas in LNs are poor at killing Mtb, even with treatment, due to lack of B-rich structures, disruption of LN structure, and introduction of macrophages that serve as niches for M, and destruction of vasculature. The study shows that Ls are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation but also persistence of significant numbers of M bacilli.
A collection of novel nematode-infecting microsporidia and their diverse interactions with Caenorhabitis and other nematodes. Microsporidia are fungi-related intracellular pathogens that infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. Caenorhabitis elegans has become a model for studying microidia through identification of its microidian pathogen Nematida paris. However, it was unclear how widespread and diverse microidia are in C elegans or other nemat in the wild. We describe isolation and culture of 47 nemodes with microidian infections. N. paris is most common microidian infecting Cans in the wild. Six new species in Nematida genus are described. Phylogenetic analysis identifies two subclades distinct from Nematida, named Entersect and Ptospora. Unlike Nemat, these belong to main clade microidia includes human pathogens. All microidia are horizontally transmitted and infect intestinal cells, except Ptos that replicates in epidermis of Caenor host. Subcellular in infected cell, spores Entersect show apical distribution and exit via budding, unlike Nemat exit via exocytosis. Host specificity is broad for some microidia, narrow for others. Some microidia infect Osche but not sister Osche, and vice versa. Nauseli fails to induce C eleg transcription genes induced by Nemat species, suggesting mechanisms to prevent host response. Newly isolated illustrate diversity and ubiquity microidian in nemodes and provide resource investigate host-paras coevolution in nemodes.
Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors, play crucial roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis and HIV infection. Studies have shown that homo- and heterodimers of chemine receptors CXCR, CCR, and C2 modulate receptor function, and membrane cholesterol affects chemine activity. However, structural information on homo and heterodimers of chemine receptors and their interaction with cholesterol is limited. This study reports homo and heterod configurations of chemine receptors CXCR, C, C, and C at atomic detail from molecular simulations. Homodimer patterns were similar for closely related chemine receptors, yet differed between CCR and CX4. Cholesterol modulated homod interfaces in subtype-specific manner. Chemine heterod display distinct dimer patterns CX4/5 and CX/2. Associations between CX and C reveal increased cholesterol sensitivity compared to CX/2 heterodimer patterns. This work provides a comprehensive overview of interaction between chemine receptors and how heterodization and interaction with environment diversifies function of related GPC.
Researchers have identified an "atypical" form of systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, in patients presenting with depressed immunity. This form is distinct from the classical presentation of fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting, and a subclinical form with one or two of these symptoms and lymphadenopathy and anemia. In a study of 160 patients referred to an immunology laboratory, 19.4% had normal laboratory profiles but macrophages laden with Leish parasites. This atypical form presents as a masquerading condition where the immune system is non-functional, predisposing patients to recurrent infections with various symptoms. The findings indicate systemic leishias has a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected and is more common than diagnosed. Among 31 patients, adults were affected, showing the disease is not limited to the pediatric group. The authors recommend considering atypical leishiasis in patients with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to investigate the relationship between disease-causing variants and their locations in paralogous proteins. They found that variants at homolog positions in paralog proteins are correlated, and if one member of a variant pair is disease-causing, the other is likely to be disease-causing as well. This information can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. A dataset of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and HGMD was used to identify and characterize pairs of variants at homolog positions in human genes. Results show that variants co-occur at aligned amino pairs more frequently than expected, suggesting functional constraints on paralog sequences result in coordinated distributions of disease and non-disease variants. This approach can be used for hypothesis generation and departure for clinical research, and to identify new disease candidates and uncharacterized variants likely to have phenotyp consequences. A collection of disease-causing variations from OM and HG was mapped to gene and protein sequences, suggesting algorithms for disease identification based on sequence conservation may miss instances. Paralog genes and variantairs can provide additional information for in silico characterization, complementary to approaches like SIFT and PolyPhen. Rare disease variants in paralog proteins tend to pair, and alignments provide a resource for genomics.
Researchers analyzed the gene expression of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falcum in 44 isolates from patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua New Guinea using RNA sequencing. The results showed that parasites causing severe malaria had altered expression of genes involved in glycolysis, chromatin structure, and transcription regulation, and surface antigens. Specifically, they had reduced expression of PfEMP1, a major target of protective immunity, and down-regulated multiple chaperone proteins. The study also found associations between disease severity and Pf1 transcripts, domains, and confirmed previous associations between expressed Pf1 sequences and disease. These findings will inform vaccine targets for severe malaria and how parasites adapt to the host environment in severe malaria.
Researchers used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to rhesus monkeys, achieving persisting levels of mAb as high as 270 μg/ml. However, host responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of delivered antibody that could be achieved, with a range of 1-270 μ/ml. Following repeated intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac, six monkeys in the AAV-5 Ig1 group showed protective effects despite absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the virus. Protective effects included lowering of viral load peak, lowering viral set point, and delay in time to peak load from exposure. All effects were statistically significant. The monkey with highest delivered 5m resisted six successive SIV challenges, including a final challenge of 10 infectious units. Results demonstrate continued promise for prevention of HIV-1 infection. However, antibody responses need to be understood for this approach to be realized.
Researchers investigated the conformational motions of two motor proteins, myosin and kinesin K1A, using a coarse-grained elastic network approximation. They found that the assumption of linearity in response to thermal or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment, is deficient and can be violated even for thermal fluctuations. This is particularly pronounced in kines K1, where the normal mode description fails to describe mechanochemical motions. The study suggests that the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered, as neither a single mode nor a superposition of modes can approximate nonlinear dynamics. Conformation relaxation associated with ligand binding and hydrolysis in myos can be qualitatively characterized by normal modes, but the description breaks down for kines K1. Despite this, ordered and robust mechchemical motions are present in both proteins, which cannot be described by linear response. Large conformation changes due to lig binding are often considered in linear theory and normal approximation, but this study reveals nonlinearity in both proteins.
Researchers have investigated the interaction between clathrin-independent endocytic pathways and found that specific caveolar proteins, specifically Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, act as negative regulators of the clath-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched endosomal (CL/GEE) endytic pathway. This regulation occurs independently of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 and Cavin-3 inhibit the CL/GEE pathway, while Cavin-2 and Cavin-4 do not. Overexpression of caveolar leads to a reduction in CL/GEE carrier formation, detected by electron microscopy. The CLEE pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV/Cavin-1 or with reduced Cavin-1 and Cavin. Inhibition by caveins can be mimicked by the caveolin scaffolding domain, associated with perturbed lipid diffusion, revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. Without caveins and caveae, CAV is endocytosed through the CLEE pathway, but loses polarization and sorting, affecting membrane dynamics and endytic in migrating cells and muscle tissue. Non-cave Cavin-1 acts as a modulator for the regulator of the CLEE pathway, C42. This study provides insights into regulation of nonave clrin-independent endocyt by caveolar proteins, illustrating multiple levels of crosstalk between pathways.
Researchers have identified a subset of Receiver (REC) domains in bacteria and Archaea that lack the conserved aspartate (Asp) residue, which is typically phosphorylated by a histidine kinase to initiate signaling. This subset, named Aspart-Less Receiver (AL) domains, comprises approximately 4% of all REC domains and are found in 2% of bacterial genomes. Analysis of AL structures and biochemical data revealed that AL domains have reorganized their active sites to accommodate signals other than phosphorylation, while retaining canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimer interface. Some AL domains have diversified to bind small molecules, such as antibiotics, and Ser-Thr phosphorylation through eukary-like kinases and PP phosphatases, regulating cell envelope functions and virulence in microbes. The most common AL substitutions at the conserved phospho-As site are Ser, Thr, and Tyr, which are known for phospho-regulation by bacterial kinases. Other AL domains have Arg or Cys at the phosph-As position, capable of phospho-reg by kinases and phosphatases. These findings define AL as an atypical REC subclass and provide insights into activation mechanisms between AL and REC domains.
Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses (HSVs) have shown efficacy in clinical trials, but most are attenuated due to deletions/mutations that counteract the host response and selectively grow in cancer cells with defective anti-viral response. Next-generation HSVs with no delet/mutations and cancer-specific retargeting to tumor receptors, such as HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), are fully virulent in cancer cells. The immunotherapy elicited by these viruses is unpredictable, as non-attenuated HS dampen the innate response, deleted/attenuated fail to induce it, and retargeted HS replicate in tumor cells but spare others. This study reports the first efficacy of HER2-targeted, fully-virulent HS in immunocompet mice. Both unarmed RM and IL-12-armed R115 inhibited primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma tumor growth, with R115 being more efficacious. Mice not dying from primary tumors were protected from contralateral growth. Long-term survivors were protected from secondal tumor, indicating absc immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis showed R115 unleashed immunosuppressive tumor environment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines and Th1 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating cells, such as CD4, CD335, were increased in responders, whereas CD8, Fox3, CD141 were increased and CD11 decreased in R115 mice. Response included break of tolerance to HER and wt cells, underscoring systemic immunotherapeutic response.
Researchers investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. They found that CD4 cells induced by the Adenovirus 5 (Ad) vector in the RV144 trial were susceptible to HIV, but those induced by the ALVAC vector in the RV144 trial were less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower susceptibility of ALAC-specific CD4 cells was associated with reduced expression of HIV co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analysis showed ALAC CD4 cells displayed a Th1 phenotype, producing high levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (M-β) but little IL-17. In contrast, ALAC and Ad vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PB, with ALAC preferentially inducing CD8-cell proliferation while Ad induced CD4-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALAC but not Ad CD8 cells in PB led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD cells, suggesting a role of ALAC-specific CD8 cells in protecting ALAC CD4 cells from HIV. The study highlights the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.
Researchers investigated the evolution of X chromosome inactivation strategies in mammals, a process where one X chromosome is silenced in female somatic cells. The choice of which X to silence varies among species, ranging from paternal X-inherited inactivation (PX), rendering females haploid for maternal alleles, to random X-inactivation (RX), equalizing maternal and paternal allele expression in each tissue. Theoretical analysis considered conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection's influence on X inactivation evolution. Results show a critical interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selects a broad range of inactivation strategies, including unequal rates between maternal and paternal X chromosomes. RX is favored over PX when deleterious alleles to females are recessive, and criteria for RX evolution is more restrictive with sexually antagonistic variation. Evolution from PX to RX increases female fitness at the expense of male fitness. Species properties and genetic variation predict patterns of selection for different inactivation. Sexual and sex-based mutation rates vary, influencing transmission of deleterious alleles between maternal and paternal X. Selection favors preferential inactivation of the chromosome with more deleterious alleles. An analysis shows evolutionary stability of X strategies. Sex-differential selection, where fitness differs between males and females, influences large fractions of genomes, affecting X diversification. Stronger selection against deleterious in males decreases proportion on paternal X.
Researchers investigated the antiviral potential of the host protein ZAP against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIK). They found that overexpression of ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIK, and depletion of endogenous Z enhanced JEV replication. Z hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3-5' exosome-mediated degradation. The zincinger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and antiv activity against JEV. The 3'-UTR, especially the region with dumbbell structures and high content of dinucleotide, was mapped to bind Z and confer sensitivity to Z. JEV was identified as the first Z-sensitive flavivirus. Z may act as intrinsic antiv factor through RNA binding against J infection. The study suggests that 3-5 RNA degradation by exosome is involved in antiv mechanism of Z against JEV.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVV) is a significant pathogen causing severe disease in humans and animals, particularly in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. This study investigated the host response to wild-type RVV strain Z501 and vaccine strain MP12 in C57/BL6 mice. Mice infected with attenuated MP12 survived with minimal disease and cytokine response, whereas Z501 infection was lethal, causing lymphocyte and platelet depletion and a strong cytokine response correlating with high virus titers and tissue pathology. Lymphopenia and platelet depletion indicated disease onset, with lymphocyte recovery correlating with G-CS production. RVV is hepatotropic, with significant clinical and histological data supporting findings, but no pro-inflammatory response in liver, instead a chemokine response with neutrophil infiltration. Brains of Z501 infected mice showed chemokine and inflammatory response with little pathology, indicating meningoencephalitis. Data suggest RVV pathogenesis in mice is liver dysfunction due to necrosis and hepatitis, with long-term disease being neurologic, supported by human and BAL/c mouse observations.
Researchers investigated the role of C motif chemokine ligand 20 (C20) in taxane chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). They found that C20 was significantly elevated in patients with non-pathologic response to taxane-containing chemotherapy. C20 promoted self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCS) through activation of protein kinase Cζ (PKζ) and p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) mediated p65 nuclear factor B (NF-κ) pathway, increasing taxane resistance in BC. Additionally, C20 increased ATP-binding cassette subfamily member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug resistance (DR) expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxane. A positive feedback loop between NF-κ and C20 pathways sustained chemoresistance in cancer cells. The study suggests C20 as a predictive marker for taxane response and blockade of C20 or its pathway may reverse tax resistance in breast cancer. Tax-induced C20 activated NF through PKζ or 38 and promoted expression of AB1, leading to chemoresistance in breast cells. NF-κ increased C20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between NF-κ and C pathways, providing impetus for chemoresistance in cancer cells. C20 stimulated proliferation, invasion, and anchorage growth in TNBC and promoted tumor growth in vivo. It also exhibited resistance to taxane, demonstrating its role in regulation of breast malignancy.
Toxoplas gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. Its ability to infect and manipulate host cells depends on transporting GRA proteins from secretory organelles called dense granules into host cells. GRA proteins have diverse roles in Toxopla's intracellular lifecycle, including hijacking host functions such as cell cycle and p38 MAP kinase. Some GRAs, like GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into parasitoph vacuole (PV) within Toxla replicates and transported across PV membrane (PVM) into host, but translocation process and machinery not understood. TMY1, cleaved by TASP into fragments, localizes PVM and essential for GRA transport into host. To identify additional proteins for effector transport, Toxla mutants defective in cyc-regulation screened for ability export GRA and GRA to host nucleus. Novel MY2 and MY3 play crucial role in translocation subset GRAs into host. MY2 and MY3 secreted PV, co-localize with PVM and MY1. Consistent predicted transmembrane domains, all proteins membrane-associated, MY3 but MY stably with MY1, N-terminal C-terminal disulf-linked. Fusing intrinsically disordered effectors structured DH domain blocks transport effectors, consistent translo model effector transport.
Researchers have investigated the role of the origin recognition complex (ORC) in the replication of papillomavirus (PV), a DNA virus that resembles a mini-chromosome in infected cells. They found that the E2 protein of PV binds to OR2, but OR2 is not present at the viral origin of replication. Depletion of OR2 enhanced replication in a transient model and keratinocyte cell line, but had no effect on a cell line with integrated genomes. This suggests OR2 suppresses E2 replicative function. Overexpression of E2 decreased OR2 occupation at mammalian origins, implying E restricts pre-RC assembly that competes with host replication complexes for viral amplification. The study suggests OR2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase and elevated E levels during differentiation subvert OR loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins.
A study was conducted in the urban and peri-urban area of Dush, Tajikistan to investigate the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk. Bruc DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 milk samples by IS-based real-time PCR. The finding is concerning as unpasteurified dairy products are common in the region. Bruc DNA was detected in the milk of seropositive cows, but 8.3% of seronegative cows also showed Bruc DNA. Sequence analysis of the rB gene suggests one cow was infected with B. abortus and another was likely infected with B. melensis. Discrepancies between serology and real PCR highlight the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect seroneg individuals in Bruc surveillance and control. Vaccination of cattle with S and small ruminants Rev may be needed to control Bruc infections. Further research on Bruc isolation is required to understand Bruc spp in the region.
Researchers investigated the role of histone H3 lysine methylation in chromosome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zoseptoria trici, which has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis and transcriptionally repressed. They deleted genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3me9 and H27, Kmt1 and K6, respectively, and generated a double mutant to determine the impact on chromosome and genome stability in vitro and in planta. Whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq were used to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure and gene expression between mutant and wild-type strains. Results showed dramatic chromatin reorganization in H9-deficient strains, with H27me mostly localized to regions enriched in H9 in wild-type, and many rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes in absence H9, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss of H27 increased stability of accessory chromosomes under normal conditions in vitro, without large changes in gene activity. H9 is important for maintaining genome stability by disallowing H27 in constitutive heterochatin, while H27 reduces overall stability of accessory, creating a "metastable" state for quasi-essential genome regions.
Researchers evaluated the cost-effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for rabies vaccination in low-income countries, where life-saving vaccines are often inaccessible and unaffordable to those most at risk. They analyzed different P regimens and their costs, finding P to be an extremely cost-effective intervention ($200-$60/death averted). Switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration resulted in significant savings, mitigating vaccine shortages and reducing costs. To make P more accessible, financing mechanisms could subsidize costs for those in need and support existing prevention programs. A universal switch to ID delivery would improve affordability and accessibility, leading to reduced rabies deaths and economical healthcare costs. 

The study examined costs of IM versus ID administration under realistic constraints, demonstrating ID to be more cost-effective in averting cases and lives. Clinic capacity affects vial sharing and cost-effectiveness relative to IM. Rabies-exposure is essential but out of reach for many, vaccine shortages common in developing countries, victims incurring costs and facing delays, resulting in avoidable deaths due to poor access. Changes in P costs could improve affordability, providing incentives without compromising budgets. Issues should be considered in P policy design to reduce rabies burden by increasing availability for the poor who bear the brunt in developing countries. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) in dollars/death averted were calculated, including direct costs from the provider's perspective.
Toxoplas, an obligate intracellular parasite, replicates within mammalian cells in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with host organelles. One mechanism for nutrient acquisition is attraction of host organelles to PV. This study examines lipid droplet (LD) exploitation by Toxoplas. Toxoplas replication is reduced in cells depleted of LD or impaired lipolysis/fatty acidolysis. In infected cells, host LD number and LD-associated gene expression (ADP, DG2) increase until parasite replication onset. PV are surrounded by host LD. Tooplas accesses host lipids in LD and incorporates into its membranes/LD. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates LDogenesis in host, resulting in neutral lipid accumulation in large LD inside parasite. Toop intercepts and internalizes LD within PV, some associated with Rab7, wrapped by intravacolar network (IV) membranes. Mutants impaired IV display diminished lipid uptake from LD. Parasites lacking IV-localized phospholipase2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from LD PV, suggesting IV major contribution to LD processing and lipid release. Gavage parasites unveil presence of endytic structures containing lipid material from PV lumen. This study highlights Tooplas reliance on LD for intracellular development and scavenging lipids from LD.
Researchers have identified chalcon compounds as potential inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica catheps, enzymes responsible for liver fluke infections in cattle and sheep. Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica are zoonotic diseases, with chemotherapy being the main control measure, and tricendazole the preferred drug. However, resistance to tricendazole has been reported, prompting the search for new molecules to control fluke infections. A library of flavonoids was screened for inhibitors of Fasciola cystine proteases FCL and FCL. Chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups emerged as cathein inhibitors, interacting with two binding sites within the active site of the enzymes. One compound, C34, bound to juvenile FCL with an IC50 of 5.6 μM. C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor interacting with the Cys catalytic dyad and S2 and S3 residues, determinants of substrate specificity of cystine proteases. C induced reduction in NE ability to migrate through gut and loss of motility, leading to NE death in vitro, without cytotoxicity to bovine cells. This is the first report of non-peptide inhibitors of Fasciola catheps in vitro. Chalcones are novel inhibitors of main catps secreted by juvenile and adult liver flukes, with C34 highly active against juvenile, reducing larval ability to penetrate gut and viability in vitro. These findings open avenues for novel agents to control fluke and helminthic diseases.
Researchers investigated how the visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. They used in vivo imaging to study how bipolar cells transmit signals to the retina and found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filtering. Individual cells transmit through terminals of varying size, with smaller terminals generating faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher gain, followed by more adaptation. Smaller terminals transmit higher frequencies more effectively. Modeling calcium dynamics of ves release indicated that variations in presynaptic compartments contribute directly to these differences in response.

Measurements of presynaptic calcium showed a strongly rectifying function of light, increasing with graded contrast. Voltage-dependent channels in terminals were responsible for non-linear transformation of the signal. Variations in presaptic signal impact output, with smaller terminals responding to step light with higher release rates. However, resolution was too low to detect modulations at frequencies >1 Hz. The next compartment in the pathway, synaptic terminals of bipolar cells, showed rectification due to increase in stimulus causing increase in release rate even with constant luminance.

To quantify time-dependent changes, an "Adapt Index" was used, calculated as ratio of peak to steady-state response. Assuming constant vesicles in terminals, predicted rate would depress more in smaller terminals. Whole-cell recordings from goldfish retina showed presaptic signals in large and small compartments while controlling the terminal. Introduction of Ca+ indicator allowed comparison of signals while achieving electrical control.
Researchers have developed a novel probabilistic method for detecting synapses from multiplex fluorescence microscopy (FM) images, which combines the advantages of fluorescence microscopy's high speed and low cost with electron microscopy's reliability. The method uses conjugate array tomography (AT) data, which provides both fluorescence and electron microscopy images of the same synapses. The algorithm accepts morphological synaptic models as queries and delivers a volumetric probability map of each voxel being part of a synapse. Compared to electron microscopy-annotated data, the method detects synapses from FM images as accurately as human annotators and reproduces known features of cortical syn distributions. This approach enables data-driven discovery of new synapse types and density. The probabilistic synapse detector is also applicable to standard confocal and super-resolution FM images where EM validation is impractical.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of action of ZnT, a zinc transporter responsible for accumulating zinc in secretory vesicles during lactation. They found that Zn2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter, meaning it uses a proton gradient to transport zinc into vesicles. This was demonstrated through experiments using Bafomycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar protonase, which alkalizes vesicles, abolishing Zn2-dependent zinc transport. Additionally, using Lyso Red and Ly-pfluor, they showed that Zn2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc resulted in vesicular alkalization due to proton-zinc antiport, which was reversed by TP, a zinc chelator. Computational calculations suggest Zn2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2+/Zn+ ion. This indicates Zn2 is a motive-driven electrutral ves zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to cytoplasm.
Researchers have identified a new role for 14-3 proteins in regulating the processing of stalled replication forks, which is essential for maintaining genome stability. They found that 14-3 proteins interact with Exonuclease 1 (Exo), an enzyme that processes stalled forks in checkpoint-deficient cells. In yeast cells lacking 14-3, Exo is hyperphosphorylated and accumulates ssDNA gaps at forks, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery. Using DNA electrophoresis, they show 14-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide conditions. This suggests 14-3 assist in controlling Exo phosphorylation and other targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to DNA stress. The study sheds light on processes at stalled forks, proposing 14-3 as central regulators of fork stability and processing.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis using a humanized mouse model. They developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes humanDC in lymphoid organs and found that depletion prior to HIV-1 infection abolished induction of type I interferons (IF-I) and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during acute HIV-1 infection. This resulted in increased HIV-1 replication. However, cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was reduced in p-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of p also reduced IF-I and IS, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-induced immune cell death in lymphoid organs was reduced despite increased replication. The study suggests p play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and promoting HIV-induced immunogenesis. Findings indicate p-depletion and IF-I blockade as novel strategies for treating HIV-1 non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite antiretroviral treatment.
Sulforaphane (SF) inhibits HIV infection in macrophages through Nrf2. SF, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables after mechanical damage, mobilizes Nrf to reprogram cellular expression. This study shows SF blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells. SF also blocks infection in PMA-differentiated promocytic lines but not in other cell lines. RNA-mediated depletion of Nrf boosts HIV infectivity in primary macroph and reduces anti-viral effects of SF treatment. This supports a model where anti-viral activity is mediated through Nrf after mobilized by SF. SF treatment blocks infection after reverse transcription but before 2-L circle formation, similar to type I interferon-induced proteins SAM1 and MX. However, neither SAM1 nor MX are upregulated. Nrf action potently blocks HIV and highlights a novel way to trigger inhibition. Nrf is detrimental to HIV in macroages and basal level sufficient for anti-v activity. SF triggers block in macroages through Nrf.
A cross-sectional study conducted in rural western Kenya investigated geohelth infections among pregnant women. Among 390 participants, 76.2% had at least one geelth infection, with Ascaris lumicoid (52.3%), hookworm (39.5%), and Trichuris trichi (29%) being the most prevalent. Infection with at least geel species was associated with use of unprotected water source (adjusted odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3) and lack of water treatment (adjusted ratio 1.8, 95 CI 1.1-3). Geel infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or body mass index. Hookworm infection was associated with lower upper arm circumference (adjusted decrease 0.7 cm, 95 CI 0.3-1.2). Hookworm with egg count ≥100/gram was associated lower hemoglobin (adjusted decrease 1.5 g/dl, 95 CI0.3-2.7). Among gravid 2 and 3 women, Ascaris lumicoid was less likely to have malaria (OR 0.4, 95 CI 0.2-0.8) compared to without Ascaris lumoid. Geel infections were common in this population, but few detrimental effects observed. Routine antelmin treatment during antenatal visit recommended, but evaluation of impact on pregnancy, malaria, and outcome useful.
Mycolone, a macrolide produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been shown to have cytotoxic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. This study investigated its effects on the inflammatory responses of nervous cell subsets involved in pain perception and transmission, as well as neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain in vivo. Sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia were isolated from mice for ex vivo assessment of mycolone cytotoxicity and immunomod activity. Prolonged (>48h) exposure to mycolone induced cell death at concentrations >10ng/ml, while nanolar concentrations suppressed pro-inflammatory mediator production without affecting viability. Notably, myone prevented pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, which contribute to neuroflammation. In a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve constriction, myone injected daily for 3 days in spinal canal decreased local inflammatory cytokine production without detectable cytotoxicity. This study provides evidence that myone suppresses inflammatory responses of sensory, Schw cells and microia without affecting viability, supporting previous studies using peripheral leukocytes that myone-mediated analgesia may be partially explained by anti-inflammatory properties.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genetic variations in human genes and the outcome of African trypanosomiasis (AT), a disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambense, in West Africa. They analyzed 425 individuals from Guinea, including 232 with AT, 79 with long-term positive serology but negative parasitology, and 114 controls. Twenty-eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in eight genes passed quality control and were used for association analysis. The study found that the IL6 rs1819 allele was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease (p=0.0001, OR=0.39, 95%CI[0.24-0.63, BF=0.003). The MIF36071 allele was associated with increased risk (p=0.023, OR=1.65, 95%CI[1.07-2.53, BF=0.669) but not significant after Bonferr correction. MIF12459 allele was associated with latent infections (p=0.007, OR=1.86, 95%[1.18-2.95, BF=0.215). The AP1G2 allele (DEL) was associated with higher risk (p=0.001, OR=2.70, 95%[1.49-4.91, BF=0.01) and AP1 polymorphism with lower risk (p=0.000, OR=0.45 95%[0.29-0.70, BF=0.012). No associations were found with other genes. The study shows host genes modulate Tryosoma bruce gambense infection in Guinea individuals, with IL1819 associated with lower risk of progressing to AT.
Researchers conducted whole-genome sequencing of 38 individuals from the Singapore Indian population, part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP), to investigate the genetic diversity of South Asians. The samples were compared to those from the Sequencing Malay Project and Phase 1 of the 1,000 Genomes Project. SSIP exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and higher heterozygous-homozygous genotype ratio than other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Indians, the genetic makeup of SSIP was closely related to South Indians, but clustered distinctly from Europeans in autosomal SNPs. Eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans, with higher European admixture than remaining samples. Analysis of relatedness to archaic homins (Denisovan, Neanderthal) showed higher ancient admixture in East populations than SSIP. The resource is publicly available and complements South Asian samples in Phase 3 of 1,000 Genomes. 

The SSIP sequenced genomes of 36 South Indians at 30X coverage, complementing 96 Southeast Malays and 1,092 samples from Phase 1 of 1,000 Genomes. Principal Component Analysis revealed greater heterogeneity in Indians from northern India, while those from south were more homogeneous. Independent analysis with Gujarati Indians from Genome Project found a third clustered with Singapore Indians. The majority of Singapore Indians descended from south India, settling after Singapore became a trading center in the 19th century. The SS aims to whole-genome sequence 38, providing insights into genetic diversity of Indians in Singapore.
Researchers investigated the molecular basis of aminoglycoside susceptibility in Burkholderia pseudallei isolates from Thailand, specifically strains 708, 218, and 379. They found that strain 708 was intrinsically resistant to aminlycosides and macrolides due to the absence of amr transcripts, whereas strains 218 and 379 had reduced levels of amr. Serial passage on gentamicin yielded mutants of 218 and 379 that were resistant to other aminlycos and macrolides, but not 708. Transcript analysis revealed that resistance in 218 and 379 was due to upregulation of amr-opA expression by unknown mechanisms. PCR walking revealed that the am-opA operon was missing in 708, associated with a deletion of over 70 kb genetic material. Rescue of the amB region from a fosmid and sequencing showed a large deletions of 131 and 141 kb compared to K43 and 10. This deletion removed the amA operon and entire clusters for malleactin and cobal synthesis genes, as well as anaerobic arginine deiminase, type 1 fimbria, and secreted chitin. Whole genome and PCR confirmed absence of these genes in 708. Despite missing putative virulence genes, 708 was fully virulent in murine meloid model. Strain 708 may be a candidate for genetic manipulation and validates use of laboratory-constructed ΔA mutants.
Researchers studied the early differentiation of CD4 T helper cells into Th1 and Th2 states by examining the expression of transcription factors and cytokines in individual cells. Contrary to the expectation of mutually exclusive expression, they found co-expression of antagonistic transcription factors Tbet and Gata in cells at high levels, distinct from basal levels during priming. Cytokines were expressed in a small subpopulation of cells, independent of transcription factor expression in these cells. Cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during early differentiation was larger than in the fully differentiated state. Inhibiting cytok signaling led to mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, revealing an intracellular network overruled by extracellular signals. Results suggest CD4 cells acquire a mixed Th1/2 state early, instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular components in Th2 differentiation may be a strategy for mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the PAQR-2 protein plays a crucial role in adapting to low temperatures by regulating fatty acid desaturation. PA-2 is homologous to the insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors in mammals and is essential for growth at 15°C, a low temperature that is usually acceptable for the organism. By screening for PA-2 suppressors, researchers identified genes involved in phosphatidcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. They found that PA-2, phosphidcholines, and Δ-9 desaturases form a pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary for membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This is supported by observations that PA-2 suppressors normalize saturated fatty acid levels and low concentrations of detergents that increase fluidity can rescue the PA-2 mutant. The study establishes a novel pathway connecting PA-2, phosphcholine, and regulation of FA desaturation to increase fluidity during cold adaptation. PA-2 increases unsaturation is essential for adaptation to 15°C in C. elegans.
Researchers have used cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of human herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virions, revealing a previously unknown feature at the portal vertex of the virus. The portal is connected to the viral tegument, a protein layer surrounding the capsid, and the viral membrane, suggesting it plays a role in genome release into the nucleus and virion architecture. This finding is consistent with evolutionary and structural links between herpesviruses and tailed bacteriophages, which share a common origin. Tailed bacterophages have a tail at the portal that mediates interactions with cellular components during the viral life cycle. Herpesviruses cause various diseases, including cold sores, chickenpox, congenital defects, and cancer. HSV-1 is a well-characterized virus with a 200 MD icosahedral capsid containing dsDNA, surrounded by tegument and glycoprotein lipid envelope. The lack of evidence for a tail in herpesvirions suggested it was unnecessary due to the eukotic cell environment. However, DNA delivery by herpesviruses may be analogous to tailed bacterophages. The HSV-1 particle varies in size, but the capsid has a constant diameter of 125 Å. The capsid features pentons, hexons, and triplexes.
Researchers investigated the effects of Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and recombinant Omega-1 (r-1) on CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses and HIV-1 infection in vitro. They found that SEA, specifically through kappa-5, potently binds to DC-SIGN and blocks DC-S mediated HIV-1 transfection, while not affecting cis-infection. DCs exposed to SEA under Th2 conditions induced T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection compared to unexposed DCs, whereas HIV-1 X infection was unaffected. This was not observed in DCs exposed to SEA under Th1 or Th1/Th2 conditions. T-cells induced by SEA-exposed DCs showed reduced IFN-γ and MIP-1 production. Infection of T-cells with HIV-1 R was associated with downmodulation of CCR5 surface expression. Recombinant r-1 demonstrated similar functions to natural-1, inducing T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection but not X virus. This was associated with reduced IF-γ and M-1 expression and CCR expression. The study suggests that parasite antigens, specifically r-1, modulate HIV-1 infectivity and may influence disease course in coinfected individuals.
Researchers investigated the phenomenon of neural activity-induced shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and astrocytes in grey and white matter. They found that neuronal stimulation causes a 30% shrinkage of the ECS. A dynamic model was developed to account for this phenomenon in wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model suggests that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, and passive channels of the Na/K pump, and osmotically transport of water through the astrocyte membrane are sufficient for ECS shrinkage. However, taking into account ECS and astrocy ion concentrations with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na+/Cl (NKCC) and Na/HCO (NBC) cotransporters are critical for achieving observed levels of ECS shrink. The model is sufficiently detailed to guide future experiments and pave the way for comprehensive astroglia-neuron models in normal and pathophysiological situations.
In Arabidopsis thalian, transposons and repetitive DNA elements can be detrimental to the organism if expressed, and their expression is suppressed by the establishment of repressive chromatin modifications. The siRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway in Arabidopsis involves non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol) guiding ARGONAUTE (AGO) to chromatin and enzymes that establish repressive chrom modifications. However, it is unknown how chromatin enzymes are recruited to chrom. This study shows that SPTLTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcription silencing. SPTLTF binding occurs downstream of Polymer V but independently of the presence of 24-nt siRNA. Additionally, SPTLTF and AGO are recruited to chrom in parallel and independently of each other. Using methylation restriction enzymes, binding of AGO and SPTLTF is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at several loci. The study proposes that coordinate binding of S and AGO creates a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chrom modifying enzymes.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Rpo regulon in the tick phase of the Borrelia burgdorferi life cycle, specifically during transmission from tick to mammal. They found that Rpo-dependent gene expression is necessary for spirochete transmission by nymphs, as Rpo-deficient organisms are confined to the midgut and transform into round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal. Round body formation is reversible and appears to be due to reduced Coenzyme disulf reductase levels, which provides NAD for glycolysis. The study established the importance of the Rpo regul during the tick phase of the enoot cycle and demonstrated that spirotes default to an Rpo-independent program for round formation when transmission energetics are unfavorable. Rpo is induced during the nymph blood meal but not in larvae or unfed nymphs, indicating a Rpo ON/OFF regulation. Expression of Rpo-dependent genes in the tick is more complex than a simple ON/OFF regulation. The findings reveal a new role for RSB in physiological adaptations for tick-mamm transmission and a default survival mode (round formation) whenirotes unable to produce energy for dissemination.
Researchers investigated the relationship between gibberin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) hormones in regulating stamen development in Arabidopsis. They found that GA promotes the expression of MYB21, MY24, and MY57 genes, which are involved in stamen elongation. Loss-of-function of DELLA proteins, which are inhibited by GA, restored the expression of these MY genes and restored stamen growth in GA-deficient plants. The myb21 my24 my57 triple mutant exhibited a short stamen phenotype leading to male sterility. Genetic and molecular studies showed that GA suppresses DELs to mobilize the expression of the JA biosynthesis gene DAD, consistent with lower JA content in GA-deficient flower buds. The study established a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA, where GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MY21, MY24, and MY57, a prerequisite for normal st development in Arabidopsis.
Researchers investigated the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in modulating lifespan extension by dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that H-1 deficiency resulted in extended lifespan, overlapping with inhibition of the RSK-1/S6 kinase, a component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. Using a modified DR method based on varying bacterial concentrations on agar plates, H-1 modulated longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner, with loss-of-function mutants extending lifespan under rich conditions but failing to show extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, increasing H- activity, diminished lifespan under DR, which was rescued by tissue-specific expression in neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by H-1 was dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inos-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) and associated with lower ER stress. The study suggests a tissue-specific role for H- in lifespan extension by the IRE-ER pathway.
Researchers have investigated how human keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, transition between two states: differentiation and migration. They found that when keratinocytes differentiate or migrate, they form unique enhancers and super-enhancers that are specific to each state. These super-enhancers are linked to genes that confer functions associated with the respective state and are enriched with disease variants. GR3, a transcription factor that promotes differentiation and migration, binds to super-enh in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters in migrating keratinocytes, repressing expression of migration inhibitors. GR3 is located in super-enh and binds to regulate them, also repressing formation of progenitor and non-keratin super in differentiating keratin. Chromatin rearrangements of GR3 binding and enhancers regulate irreversible commitment of progenitor keratin to differentiation and reversible transition to migration.
Researchers investigated the co-evolution of endogenous and exogenous retroviruses in sheep, using the species as a model. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections transmitted vertically from generation to generation, and some are hypothesized to be used by the host as restriction factors to block pathogenic retroviral infections. The study isolated and characterized the evolutionary history and virology of 27 endogenous sheep retroviruses (enJSRVs), which have been in the host genome for 5-7 million years. Two JSRVs, JS56 and JS-20, acquired a defective gag protein resulting in a dominant phenotype able to block replication of related exogenous retroviruses, and became fixed in the genome before sheep domestication (9,000 years ago). A JS escaping dominant JS has emerged recently, likely in the last 200 years. The study reveals sequential events indicative of antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. Data suggest ERs have been used by the host to fight retroiral infections. The dominant proviruses may have been selected to defend against ERs colonizing the genome rather than pathogenic exogenous retroviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of JSs and exogenous JS/ENT divided retrovir into two clades, JS-A and JS-B.
Researchers evaluated the performance of real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for diagnosing schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma mansoni and Schistoma haematobium. Current diagnosis relies on microscopic detection of eggs in stool or urine and serological assays, but these methods have low sensitivity. The study aimed to assess two in-house real-time Schos PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematob in stool, urine, and serum samples as tools for diagnosing active infections and monitoring treatment efficacy. 412 samples (124 urine, 86 stool, 8 biopsies, 194) from suspected schistosiasis patients before antiparasitic treatment were analyzed. Results were compared to microscopic and serological assays (ELISA, HA, and WB). Compared to microscopy, PCRs increased sensitivity from 4.5% to 10.5% and 33.7 to 48.8% for S. in urine and S. stools, respectively. Serum PCR sensitivity was 72.7% and 94.1 in patients with positive microscopy. Specificity was 98.9. After treatment, PCR positivity declined from 93.8 at 30 to 8.3 at 360, while antibodies remained positive 1 year. Schos PC outperformed microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods with WB-based serology, a gold standard for diagnosis. When serology is positive and microscopy negative, PC provides information for further exploration.
Researchers have successfully applied machine learning to estimate the conformational energies of complex molecules, specifically the natural product Archazolid A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase from myxobacterium Archium gephy. They used Gaussian process regression, a non-parametric machine learning method, to model the relationship between molecular structure and quantum mechanical properties. A simple molecular representation was used, sensitive to structural variations in geometries, enabling correlations between conformations and computed energy values at the density functional theory level. This approach is similar to cheminformatics, where experimentally determined properties are estimated. Machine learning has been used in various quantum mechanics contexts, including density theory, prediction of atomization energies, and transition states. Estimators of potential surfaces have been pursued since the 1990s using artificial networks. The study integrated machine learning with molecular dynamics, providing access to long simulations of challenging systems. A model was trained to capture the relationship between Archolid conformations and DFT energies. Conformations were encoded using a matrix based on nuclear charges and interatomic distances. Semi-empirical simulations were carried out with VAMP using the AM Hamilton. A structure of Archolid was modeled using NMR constraints, then minimized and refined to match the conformation of N-derived Archolid structure. The model achieved mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol for energies of relaxed conformations. This demonstrates machine learning can be developed for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, enabling speed in simulations of larger structures.
Researchers have developed a non-invasive method to detect Ebola virus antibodies in great ape feces, providing insight into wild ape Ebola infections and surveillance. This approach allows for identifying immunologically naïve populations at-risk for vaccination and tracking vaccine efficacy. The study found 10% of gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo had Ebola antibodies, indicating exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Evidence of antibodies was also found in gorillas previously thought to be unexposed, protected by geographical barriers of transmission. This method will contribute to protecting apes from future Ebola infections by detecting early exposure, identifying at-risk populations, and tracking vaccine efficacy. Since human Ebola is linked to contact with infected carcasses, identifying ape outbreaks impacts public health in local communities where case-fatality rates reach 88%. The study is the first to detect Ebola antibodies in wild ape fecal samples, relevant for ape management and survival. Strategies to protect apes against Ebola are being explored, including vaccination, as vaccines have shown to protect monkeys from disease.
Researchers have identified a novel type III effector protein, Xop, from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicator, which exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta, inducing plant cell death and subverting plant immunity. The E3 ligase activity is associated with the C-terminal region of Xop, specifically interacting with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediating K11-linked polyubiquitin formation. The crystal structure of the Xop C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in any characterized E3 ligases. Mutation of amino acids in the XL-box disrupts E ligase activity and prevents Xop-induced cell death. The structure of the N-terminal of Xop confirmed a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, potentially serving as a protein-protein module for ubiquination recognition. While E ligase is required for plant death, suppression of PAMP responses solely depends on N-terminal RR. The unique fold of E ubiquitin ligase within Xanthas Xop is unprecedented, highlighting variation in bacterial effectors mimicking eukary-specific activity.
Researchers studied the role of circulating follicular helper T cells (cTfh) in early HIV infection and the impact of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on T and B cell function in a cohort of 254 HIV-infected individuals in stages 1, 2, and 3. They found impaired cT cell function in stage 3 compared to 1/2, with lower B cell survival and IgG secretion, and increased IL-10 and TNF-α. Elevated viral load in stage 3 correlated with decreased cT-mediated B cell Ig production, indicating a role for viremia in cfh impairment and humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were observed in the B compartment, with decreased resting cells in 3 compared to 1/2, coinciding with viremia. Cocultures suggested intrinsic B defects contributed to impaired response at lower levels. cfh B responses were altered in 3 compared 1/2, with increased inflammation and reduced memory cells. Data suggest early ART for HIV-infected individuals could prevent dysregulation while preserving cfh function and cell memory.
Researchers have developed a miniaturized screen for a Schistosoma mansoni serergic protein-coupled receptor (Sm5-HT) to identify novel parasite-selective inhibitors for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease affecting 200 million people worldwide. Current therapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel, with suboptimal features, necessitating next-generation anthelmintics. The study pharmacologically profiled Sm-HT as a modulator of praziquel efficacy in a miniaturized assay with high-content screening, employing a luciferase biosensor sensitive to cellular AMP levels. Data showed divergent pharmacological signature between paras serergic receptor and closest human homolog (5-HT7), supporting parasitic pharmacores optimization. New ligands and series with potency and selectivity for Sm-HT over 5-HT7 were identified in vitro and validated in vivo against schosomules and adult worms. Sm-HT displayed irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon at 5-HT, enhancing its appeal as a target for anthint design. The study underscores feasibility of flatworm GPCRs in high-throughput screening to resolve classes of modulators and Sm-HT as chemotherapeutic node for next-generation anthelmics.
During gastrulation, the formation of the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) is crucial for the development of the metazoan body. In some organisms, such as flies, fish, and amphibians, the ectodermesoderm boundary not only separates the layers but also serves as a substrate for mesoderm migration, requiring compatibility with cell attachment and detachment. Research has shown that localized contact-induced detachment at the boundary is key to ectodermeserm segregation. Cells alternate between adhesion and detachment, mediated by Ephrin/Eph signaling. Multiple Ephrin ligands and Eph receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary, with separation dependent on forward signaling in both directions, involving redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho. This mechanism differs from simple adhesion-based germ layer formation, involving localized responses to signals at the boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle allowing cell migration across a substrate.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify biochemical markers of the disorder. Discriminant analysis correctly classified 96.1% of neurotypical participants and 97.6% of ASD participants. Additionally, partial least squares regression predicted adaptive behavior, measured by the Vineland Adaptive Composite score, using 5 metabolites of the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism pathway with an R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. This level of accuracy exceeds previous approaches in the field, indicating strong correlation between metabolites and ASD diagnosis. The study used advanced statistical tools to examine metabolite data from 3-10 year olds with ASD, neurotypical, and sibling participants. Oxidative stress was defined by DSM-IV, ADOS, and CARS score >30. Folate metabolism metabolites from 83,47,76, and 47 ASD, sibling, sibling, and age-matched neurotyp children were used for classification. 55 ASD participants had Vineland scores for regression (46-106). The Vin Adaptive Composite evaluates adaptive skills through semi-structured caregiver interview. Multivariate analysis provided unprecedented classification separating ASD and neurotyp cohorts based solely on biochemical data. Existing studies reported differences in mean metabol levels, but not designed for classification and failed to classify. Incorporating multiple measurements increased separability and predicted severity.
Researchers applied Bayesian geostatistical modeling to analyze the incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmanias in Brazil from 2001-2010, focusing on spatial and temporal patterns. They used integrated Laplace approximations for fast Bayesian inference and variable selection to identify climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors. Results showed precipitation and socioeconomic factors were significant for both types of leishiasis. Predicted cases for 2010 were 30,189 (SD: 7,676) for cutaneous and 4,889 (SD:288) for visceral leishias. Maps identified Minas Gerais and Para as high-risk states for visceral and cutaneous leishias, respectively. High-resolution maps pinpointed areas for targeted control efforts to reduce incidence. 

The study used Bayesian geostat models on available data from Brazil's Ministry of Health, employing variable selection to identify environmental and socioeconomic predictors. Previous analyses mapped leishias incidence at state level, but rarely used statistical approaches accounting for spatio-temporal correlations. This study analyzed data from 2001-201, employing geostat negative binomial models via INLA, predicting diseases using climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic covariates. High-resolution maps for leishias and estimated infected people at state level. The Ministry of Health reported country-wide maps without Bayesian approaches. Al et al. (2012) provided worldwide leish estimates and Brazil maps, aggregated by state. This study provided country-based maps for cutaneous and visceral leishias at 88km resolution, exploring spatial processes, risk, and high areas.
A study of 647 adults and 881 children with deng admitted to a hospital in Vietnam found significant differences in clinical and laboratory features between the two age groups. Adults experienced more severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding manifestations, while children had more severe vascular leakage and shock. Thrombocytopenia was associated with secondary infection and serotype, but age had a smaller effect. Adults had lower platelet counts than children, both during and after recovery. The study suggests age-dependent physiological differences contribute to the pattern of complications seen with deng infection.
Researchers have identified a novel mutation in the CCR5 gene in sooty mangabeys (SM) that results in a truncated protein that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in vitro. This mutation is present in 26% of a large SM colony, along with a 3% for a C5Δ24 allele that also abrogates surface expression. 8% of animals are homozygous for C5 and 41% are heterozygous. The mutation is also found in wild SM in West Africa. CD8 and CD4 T cells display a gradient of C5 expression across genotype, highly significant for CD8 cells. The prevalence of SIVm infection is not significantly different in animals lacking C5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type. Animals lacking C5 have robust viral loads, modestly lower than wild-type. SIVm isolates infect homozyg mutant and wild PBMC in C5-independent manner in vitro and Envs from C-null and wild-type animals use CX6, G15, and G1 in addition to C5 in transfected cells. This indicates SIVm relies on C-independent pathways in SM homozy for C5 and alternative use in SM with C5 wild is uncertain, suggesting SIV tropism and cell targeting in vivo is defined by distribution and use of pathways in addition to C5. SIV entry through alternative in vivo raises possibility of C-negative cells may be more expendable than C+ and enable virus to replicate without disease in face restricted C expression in SM and other natural species.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor MEF2 in the development of tumors, specifically in leiomyosarcomas (LMS), a rare soft tissue cancer. They found that MEF can have both pro-oncancerous and tumor-suppressing activities, depending on its interaction with coactivators or co-repressors. MEF influences histone modifications, such as H3 methylation and H3 acetylation, which are critical for gene activation and repression. Class II HDs, a type of histone deacetylase, are overexpressed in 22% of L, where high levels of MEF, HD4, and HD9 inversely correlate with overall survival. Knockout of HD9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of L cells by restoring transcription of MEF-target loci. HD9 also demethylates H3me at promoters of M-target genes. Class II HDs do not bind regulatory elements bound by M2. M-targets can be both transcribed and repressed, but are poised in chromatin signature. The study suggests class II HD and HD9 as druggable targets for therapeutic intervention in L.
Researchers have used a combination of protein docking, molecular simulation, and cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of hydrophobin films composed of two class II hydrophobins, HFBI and HFB, produced by Trichoderma rei. The results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins with P6 symmetry, but experimental results show P3 symmetry with a unit size of 56 Å. Computational simulations indicate an alternate structure with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit size. A Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydroobin film shows the alternate structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydroob films, indicating a mechanism of significance to both biology and nanotechnology. The study used cryo-EM, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics to obtain atomic resolution of assembled hydroob films at air-water interface. The structures of HF and HFB of T. rei were studied, with high resolution structures available. The experimentally observed unit size of 2-D crystal of hydroob matches lattice of close-packed hexagonal arrangement of proteins, hosting seven molecules, but seen as uniform sheet by AFM. Macroscopic properties of hydroob films arise from cooperative stabilisation of film from interactions between interlocking proteins in surface network. Interfac assemblies of hydroob have industrial applications and biological significance.
Researchers have identified and characterized the threonine tRNA synthetase (Thr) enzyme in Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis. Recombinant Thr (rThr) was expressed in E. coli and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Thr is localized in the cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of Thr were generated in Leish promastigotes, which showed a restrictive growth phenotype and attenuated infectivity, and were more susceptible to the Thr inhibitor borid. Several attempts to obtain Thr homozyg null mutants were unsuccessful, indicating its essentiality for Leish survival. Borid showed a strong affinity for Thr (KD: 0.04 μM) and inhibited aminoacylation activity (IC50:0.06 μM) and promastig (IC:21M) stage parasites. The study demonstrates Thr's potential as a target for antileman drug discovery. The enzyme's activity was 1.7 min-1, similar to Trypanosoma brucei, and Km 1.2 ± 0.23 μM for tRNThr. Immunofluores analysis showed cytosolic localization. Bioinformatic analysis predicted cytos localization. Gene knockdown of Thr in Trypanosoma bruce showed growth and phenotypic changes, suggesting potential for drug targeting. This is the first characterization of Thr from Leish donani, with catalytic efficiency similar to Trypanosoma bruce.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the innate immune receptor RIG-I through the presence of a 5'-phosphate (5-pp) on viral RNA associated with a 3' poly-UUC tract. The study defines the HCV pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and criteria for R-I non-discrimination of HCV by examining RNA-function attributes that impart AMP to the poly-UUC tract. A 34 nucleotide polyuridine core of the sequence is essential for R-I activation, and interspersed ribosine nucleotides between poly sequences in RNA are required for optimal R-I induction. 5-pp poly-U RNA variants stimulate R-I efficiently in vitro and interaction with the repressor and helicase domains of R-I is required for signaling. Appended to 5-pp RNA lacking AMP activity, the-UUC core confers non-recognition of RNA and innate signaling by R-I. Importantly, HCV-U variants strongly activated R-I triggered potent anti-H responses in vitro and hepatic immune responses in vivo using a mouse model. The study defines a multi-mot P signature of non-recognition by-I that incorporates 5-pp with polyuridine composition and length. This HAMP drives R-I signaling to induce the immune response to infection.
Researchers investigated the role of eosinophils in promoting the growth of Trichinella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle tissue. They found that IL-4 and eosophils are necessary for normal larval growth and that eosophils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth. The eosophil effect operates in the absence of adaptive immunity. Following invasion by larvae, host gene expression in skeletal muscle was compatible with a regenerative response and shift in source of energy in infected tissue. The presence of eosoph suppressed local inflammation and influenced nutrient homeostasis in muscle. Redistribution of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phosphorylation of Akt were observed in cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose and glycogen storage by larvae. The data suggest a mechanism in which eosoph promote larval growth by IL-4 dependent that limits interferon-driven responses that alter nutrient in muscle. 

Eosin-derived IL-4 activates GLUT pathway and translocation in infected cells, supporting a mechanism that enhances glucose uptake in host cells. This pathway requires further experimentation to confirm. Alternatively, glucose can be regulated by IL-4 indirectly. Results are consistent with a mechanism in which larval growth is supported when eosoph or eosoph-derived IL limits STAT signaling that inhibits glucose and lipid metabolism in muscle. Gene knockouts of eosoph or cells will clarify the mechanism. Eos derived from IL-4 mice were necessary for lar growth. Genome profiling identified genes altered in muscle during infection coinciding with eosoph requirement. Rag- mice were used to limit infiltrating cells in tissue. Observations support a model in which eosoph contribute IL- dependent regeneration in response to injury caused by NBL. Lar growth was supported when eosoph restored by transfer from IL or STAT- mice. Eos express IL receptor and may develop in presence IL to produce mediators that support growth. Lar growth not affected by absence I2. Transfer IL- eos failed to improve growth in mice.
A recent genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in human cells contradicts the view that mammalian chromosomes consist of megabase domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless regions. In HeLa cells, replication origins are spaced approximately 40 kilobases apart and fire in clusters, with increasing synchrony during S phase, while replication velocity remains constant at 0.7-2 kilobases per minute. A multi-scale analysis of genome-wide timing shows a broad distribution of replication gradients with no regions larger than 100 kilobases replicating at less than 2 kilobases per minute. HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Temporal regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at an increasing rate during S, and timing is set by the delay and spacing between origin firings rather than velocity. Activation of internal origins in a temporal region is demonstrated by DNA combing of the IGH locus in He cells. Analysis of origin maps in He cells and published timing DNA comb data in other cell types corroborate findings, except embryonic cells where regions of unid fork seem more abundant.
Researchers investigated how the "temporal stability" or "slown" approach, which enables the nervous system to recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting, can be implemented within biologically realistic learning rules. They showed that slow feature analysis, an algorithm based on slown, can be implemented in continuous neurons by a modified Hebbian learning rule, linking it to the trace rule, another slown learning implementation. Analytically, for Poisson neurons, slown learning can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific window. Studying STDP dynamics, they found that the learning outcome is governed by the convolution of the window with the postsynaptic potential, not the window alone. They derived STDP windows implementing slow analysis and the trace rule, compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. Analysis showed the window can be split into reversible and irreversible components sensitive to input statistics. Irreversible statistics generate oscillatory weight dynamics. The study suggests STDP's functional role in neurons. 

In a continuous model, modified Hebb learning enables neurons to learn slown combination of inputs. This links SFA to the trace rule, another slown implementation. For a spiking neuron, Poisson, STDP can implement slown. A linear neuron's ensemble-averaged behavior can be reproduced by STDP. The outcome is governed by the convolution of the window with EP, relevant for ST interpretations. The window realizing SFA can be calculated analytically. Physiologically plausible parameters lead to a window in agreement with findings. A new interpretation of STDP as slown compensating neuronal filters is proposed.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells exposed to therapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas toolkit, they engineered phenotypically diverse NSCL cells with mutations in Dicer, a type III cytoplasmic endonuclease involved in non-coding RNA genesis. In a three-dimensional growth dynamics, fluorescently-labeled mutant and wild-type cells were cultured individually or co-cultured under stimulated or unstimulated drug conditions. Mathematical modeling and flow cytometry characterized growth patterns of mono and co-cultures, revealing that combination of WT and mutants co-cult allowed beneficial growth in drug-sensitive cells despite pressure via cooperative game-theoretic change in fitness. An ex vivo human tumor model predicted clinical response to drug sensitivity and morphological heterogeneity correlated with prognostic failure of multiple-approved and off-label drugs in NSCL patient samples. This study presents a paradox in drug resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among cells to thwart pressure, suggesting profiling druggable targets alone may be insufficient for effective therapy.
A cross-sectional seropreval study was conducted in the Mbeya region, South Tanzania, to estimate the serrevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Group (SFG) ricketiae and assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. A total of 1,228 persons above 5 years old were randomly selected from nine communities, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic mammals. Serology (indirect immunofluorescence) was performed at a dilution 1:64. SFG-serositivity in the cohort was 67.9% (range 42.8-91.4%). Multivariable analysis revealed associations with age (prevalence ratio per 10 years 1.08; 95 CI 1.06-1.10), warmer temperatures (per °C 1.38; 1.11-1.71), male gender (1.08;1-1.16), and low density (per 1,000/km² 0.96 0.94-0.99). At higher elevations, cattle density was associated with higher servalence. SFG ricketial seems common in rural population of Mb Region, spread limited by temperature and elevation. Examination of S contribution to febrile illnesses warranted in prospective study to estimate disease burden and causative pathogens.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Through an RNA screen of regulators of immune genes, they found two stoyl-CoA desaturases that synthesize oleate in C. elegans. The synthesis of oleate is necessary for the pathogen induction of immune genes, and C. elegans deficient in ole production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse pathogens, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous ole. However, ole is not sufficient to drive immune activation. This study adds to the health-promoting effects of monouns fatty acids and suggests a link between nutrient metabolism and susceptibility to bacterial infection. The researchers also found that ole and polyunsaturated fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid and stearic acid, have distinct effects on immune activation and resistance to infection. C elegans deficient in ole production are more susceptible to killing by pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia faalis, and Staphylococcus marces in a manner dependent on ole, which is the most abundant fatty acid in C. elegans. The effect of ole on immune activation is not through metabolism to γinolenic and stearic acid, as shown by path susceptibility and immune transcription profile of fat-2 mutants. Supplementation of exogenous ole rescued the immune defect in fat-6 RNAi animals in a dose-dependent manner. The study indicates ole and polyunsaturated fatty acids affect immune expression and pathogen resistance by different mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a novel pyrimidine compound, PC, which selectively inhibits the growth of a subgroup of bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens, by targeting the guanine ribwitch, a regulatory element involved in purine metabolism. Guanine ribwitches modulate gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding and stabilize 5'-untranslated mRNA, causing transcription attenuation of the downstream reading frame. The compound PC shows bactericidal activity only when the guA, a gene for GMP synthase, is under the control of the ribwitch. Among tested strains, several clinical exhibiting multiple drug resistance were inhibited, suggesting PC targets a different metabolic pathway. A mouse model demonstrated a direct correlation between PC administration and reduction of Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands. This work establishes the possibility of using existing knowledge to design guanine ribwitch-targeting antibiotics as selective antimicrobial compounds. Guanine ribwitches are part of the purine class, also comprising adenine and 2-deoxyguanine, and regulate transcription at high guanine concentration in Bacillus subtilis. The aptamer is organized around a three-way connecting helices, with a critical nucleotide involved in Watson-Crick base interaction with the ligand. Break group used purine derivatives to target guwitch and found molecules inhibited growth, with one repressing expression of a guwitch-controlled gene.
Researchers investigated how gaze influences the construction of mental space during navigation in primates by examining behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity in macaque monkeys navigating a virtual reality maze for a reward. Cells sensitive to one or more variables like direction, point of gaze, or task fired at the sight and in anticipation of a landmark in a viewpoint-dependent manner, encoding the animal's situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Hippocampal activity was best fit by a fine-grained space comprising current position, view, and context. The findings indicate that primate cells embody multidimensional task-situated knowledge to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in space construction. This type of coding is ubiquitous in mammals, consistent with encoding task-related hippocal neurons in rodents. 

The study probed the nature of hippocal coding in a goal-oriented task, separating goal and landmarks, and examined cells for position, direction, and target gaze. The goal setting enabled examining task-related context modulated cells. Previous primates, including humans, showed hippocal encoded spatial views, place, or a mixture of place and view. In a controlled VR setting, findings show hippocal display fine tuning preferentially one landmark being viewed and self-position relative to landmark. The results give a comprehensive analysis of variables controlling hippocal cells, bridging rodent and primate studies in real and virtual environments. Hippocamp cells code target gaze in informed, embedding-position respect elements and context. Data suggest primate place cells, compared rodents, expressed activity to point gaze with other navigation variables, position, and visual elements instants planning.
Researchers conducted a spatial analysis of gene expression patterns at the midbrain boundary (MHB) in mice to understand the regulatory interactions between transcription and secreted factors involved in its development. They employed Boolean logic minimization of functions to predict the interplay of regulatory interactions and found that fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) maintains, rather than induces, wingless 1 (Wnt) expression. Experiments using anterior neural tube explants confirmed that F8 maintains, but does not induce ectopic Wnt expression. The study constructed a regulatory network of key transcription and secret factors at the HB and analyzed Boolean differential equation and reaction-diffusion models to confirm its ability to explain the maintenance of the HB and expression patterns under wild-type and knockout conditions. The research demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can provide information about regulatory networks, revealing the maintenance of the HB on a systems level.
Theileria annulata, an apicomplex parasite, infects host cells by inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of the parasitized population. After sporozoite entry, the host cell membrane dissolves and an array of host microtubules (MTs) surrounds the parasite, which transforms into a schizont. The schizont remains tethered to host MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis, engaging the cell's astral and central MTs for distribution between daughter cells. The mechanism of schizont stabilizing host MTs is unknown. MT minus ends are anchored at the organizing center, while plus ends explore cellular space, switching between growth and shrinkage phases (dynamic instability). The schizont recruits end-binding protein 1 (EB1), a key regulator of host MT dynamics, by interacting with T. annata p104, a polymorphic antigen on the schizont surface. EB binding depends on a consensus SIP motif in p104's disordered C-terminal region. Interaction with host EB is cell cycle-regulated. This is the first description of a pathogen-encoded protein interacting with EB via a SIP motif. Theiler schizont taps into the host cytoskeleton network, interaction with host MT during mitosis and cytokinesis crucial for persistence. EB facilitates initial interaction of MT plus ends with schizont, but additional molecules required for stabilization. Preliminary observations suggest host CL1, a MT-stabilizing protein, contributes. EB association with sch surface not accompanied by loss of MT, sch remains associated with host MT throughout mitosis.
In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, broken replication forks are normally repaired via homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR). A mutation in the replicase Cdc9 gene results in a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken forks, constitutively activating the DNA checkpoint and leading to longer telomeres. Telomere length requires functional telomerase, the DNA signaling cascade Mec1-Rad-Rad53, and BIR pathway components Rad51, Rad52, 32, and P1. The Mec-R53 phosphorylation of P1, necessary for inhibiting telomerase at double strand breaks, is also important for P1's role in BIR and telom elongation in c9 cells. Two other mutants, c44 and r3, similar to c9, have long telomeres dependent on P1 phosphorylation. A genome-wide screens for S cerevisiae deletions causing telom length or shortening found genes relevant to metabolism, replication, repair, and chromatin. We propose that like c9, telom effects may result from constitutive DNA damage generation. DNA-induced P1 phosphorylation promotes telom-stabilizing tel extension while repressing deleterious de novo telom events at breaks, funneling DNA into genome-preserving pathways.
Researchers investigated the use of luciferase immunoprecitation systems (LIPS) as a rapid, specific, and standardized assay for diagnosing Onchocerca volulus infection. Four recombinantly produced Onocerca volulus antigens (OvAR-1, API-1, Ov-MS-1, and OvPI-1) were tested on a large cohort of sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onoc volulus, Wucher bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongloides stercis, and other cross-reactive infections. Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed unequivocal differentiation between infected and uninfected sera with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each antigen in infected sera revealed they were markedly different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to infected, patients with W, L, S, and other conditions had lower geometric antibody titers to each antigen. A mixture of the four antigens in standard or 15-minute IPS showed 100% sensitivity and specificity distinguishing infected from unected sera. IPS had best performance with 76, 84, and 93 for distinguishing from W, L, and S-infected sera. The multi-antigen IPS can be a rapid, high-throughput tool for diagnosing individual infections and sensitive point-of-care for early detection recrudescence in areas control and mapping new transmission.
A 54-month iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming program was implemented in a rural area of northern Vietnam to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted infections in women of reproductive age. The study used a prospective cohort design and enrolled 389 participants prior to the intervention. After 54 months, 76% of participants were taking ironolic acid supplements and 95% had received deworming treatment. Hemoglobin levels rose from 122 g/L to 131/L and anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18, with significant differences between ethnic groups. Iron deficiency decreased from 23% to 8 and iron deficiency anemia from 4%. Hookworm infection reduced from 76 to 11 and moderate or heavy infestation of soil-transmitted helth to less than 1%. The study found that population-based interventions can efficiently reduce anemia and eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil helth infections below public health concern levels.
Researchers have identified a novel immune evasion mechanism used by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a type of herpesvirus, to avoid detection by the immune system. The virus encodes a protein called gp150, which is heavily glycosylated and forms a shield on the surface of infected cells. This shield impedes the presentation of antigens to immune cells, including HLA class I, H class II, and CD1 molecules. The mechanism does not involve degradation of antigen-presenting molecules nor requires the cytoplasmic tail of gp150. EBV gp150 is expressed during the late phase of replication, when most antigens are produced that could activate T and iKT cells. Infection with a gp-null mutant EBV showed rescued levels of antigen presentation by HLA I, H II, and CD, indicating an important role for iKT cells in fighting EBV. The study supports the notion that herpesviruses use diverse ways to evade not only T but also iKT immunity. EB gp150 prolongs the lifespan of viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the life cycle.
Researchers have identified a conserved actin binding domain in the translocated actin recruiting protein (Tarp) among pathogenic chlamydial species, which is essential for bacterial invasion of host cells. A peptide antibody specific to the actin binding domain inhibited actin polymerization in vitro and entry of Chlamydia trachomatis in vivo. Sequence analysis of Tarp orthologs from various chlamial species revealed multiple putative actin binding sites. GSTarp fusions from multiple chlamial species were examined for their ability to bind and nucleate actin, showing variable numbers of actin sites and promoted actin nucleation in vitro. A peptide antibody to the actin domain prevented T mediated actin nucleation and reduced host susceptibility to chlamial infection when delivered into cells. Some chlamial strains contain multiple actin domains on a single polypeptide, potentially utilizing a hybrid mechanism of actin nucleation involving multiple monomers and oligomerization by upstream proline domain. T mediated actin polymerization is conserved among diverse chlamial species, suggesting the actin domain plays a role in bacterial entry. All pathogenic chlamial strains harbor T effector, with divergent protein sequence but conserved actin domain. Chydia trachatis elementary bodies synthesize T effector, tyrosine phosphorylated upon translocation to host cytos, implicated in act recruitment at chlamial attachment site. T polymerizes act independently host factors vitro, distinct from eukaryotic nucleators.
Researchers have developed a new technique called formalin-ethylate sedimentation-digestion (F-SD) to precisely quantify Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces. This method is crucial for determining the prevalence and intensity of the parasite in mammalian hosts, such as water buffaloes, which contribute to 75% of human transmission in the People's Republic of China. The F-SD technique involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy. It removes 70% of debris from fecal samples, making it easier to visualize S. japon eggs and accurately estimate infection in boines and other ruminant hosts. The method is as effective as real-time PCR for determining schosome prevalence in boines but less costly to implement. It can be a valuable tool for surveillance in areas with low to high infection intensity or suspected schosiasis elimination.
Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage protein (CRTAP) and proly 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H) encoded by LEP1 were first identified as causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). These proteins, together with cyclophilin (encoded PPI), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a proline on the α1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis-trans isomerase Pase activity for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest proly 3-hydrolation of Pro is not required for collagen stability, but absence of this post-transl modification disrupts protein interactions for proper folding and leads to collagen overmodification. PH and CRTAP stabilize each other, and absence of one results in degradation of the other. Hypomorphic or loss of function of either gene causes loss of the complex and associated functions. The contribution of this complex's 3-hydrolysis versus Pase and chaperone activities to OI phenotype is unknown. To distinguish, knock-in mice were generated carrying a single amino substitution in the catalytic site of PH (Lep1H662). This abolished PH activity but retained ability to form complex with CRT and chaper function. Knock mice showed absence proly 3-hydrolation at Pro of α(I) and α(II) chains but no overmodification at other residues. They were normal in appearance, no growth defects and cartilage plate histology but decreased trabecular bone mass. This model recapitulates elements of O bone but not cartilage phenotypes caused loss proly 3-hydrolation complex. Observations suggest differential consequences due selective inactivation PH hydroxylase versus ablation proly 3-hydro complex.
Researchers have discovered that the P-element, a selfish genetic element, has invaded the Drosophila simul species, causing hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes including sterility, similar to its invasion of Drosila melanogaster. A survey of 181 D simul strains found 20% induce dysgenesis. Genomic and transcript data show the dys-inducing phenotype is associated with the P-element invasion. The invasion occurred rapidly and simultaneously in regions, with strains containing P-elements rare in 2006 and common by 201. Strains from the latter phase of invasion have adapted to suppress the P-element's effects, evidenced by resistance to the dys phenotype. A hybridgenesis system was identified in D simul using next generation sequencing and PCR, with the P-element associated with the dys phenotype and spread across Europe, Africa, and America. Compared to D melanaster, the spread in simul is surprisingly fast. Both simul and melanaster have evolved to suppress the dys phenotype by the end of the study, suggesting strong selection to ameliorate the P's effects, underscoring the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish elements. simul has lower rates of P-induced gonadal dys than melanaster, with high sterility expected to hamper the P's spread.
Researchers have developed a method to use rhodamine B, a fluorescent dye, to mark the body and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for mark-release experiments and estimate the efficacy of sterile male releases. The technique involves feeding males 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% rhamine in 50% honey solutions during flight, resulting in >95% transfer to females and successful marking after 4 days, with 0.4 and 0.8 solutions producing the longest body marking. Rhodamine marking had no effect on male competitiveness and proof-of-principle releases demonstrated transfer of marked fluid to females under field conditions and recapture of marked males. This method is useful for evaluation of male-based IT control strategies and a viable marking technique for male-release experiments without negative effects of traditional methods. Rhamine marking is less expensive than PCR and stable isotope labelling methods and less time-consuming than female fertility assays to assess competitiveness of sterilized males.
Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. CD28, a homodimer expressed on T cells, functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through interaction with its B coligands. Research shows that to elicit inflammatory cytokine expression and toxicity, superigens must bind directly to the dimer interface of CD. Preventing access of superigen to CD suffices to block lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superigen challenge by peptide mimetics of the CD dimer interface and peptides to compete with superigen for binding in CD. Superigens use a conserved strand/helix domain of unknown function to engage CD. Mutation of superigen domain abolished inflammatory gene induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed when superigen binds to T receptor on cell and major histocompatibility class molecule on antigen-presenting cell, CD can accommodate as superigen receptor in ternary complex with CD dimer oriented towards strand/helix domain superigen. Findings identify CD homimer as critical receptor for superigens. Role of CD as receptor for class microbial pathogens, superigens broadens pathogen recognition mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the role of the Wnt/β-caten pathway in regulating the cell cycle and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). They found that activation of the Wnt pathway triggers the transcription of the Ink/Ar tumor suppressor locus through the recruitment of the transcription factor Tcf1, leading to a drastic reduction in cell proliferation without affecting pluripotency. This is in contrast to its mitogenic effect in somatic tissues. Tcf1, but not T3, is recruited to the promoters of cell cycle repressor genes such as p15k4, p16k4 and p19, mediating the W-dependent anti-proliferative effect in ES. Ablation of β-caten or T1 expression impairs W-dependent cell regulation. The W/βaten pathway downregulates some differentiation genes while expression of plurotency remains unpert. The cell effects are dependent on βaten and T1 but independent of T3, indicating non-overlapping functions of T/L factors in ES. T1 is enriched at the promoters of cycle genes such as the Ink/Ar locus. GSK inhibition or βaten transcriptionally regulates expression of the Ar family members in T3-independent manner. T1 KD lines show decreased expression of plurotent markers. Activation of W induces negative regulators of cell such as tumour suppressors Cn2 p16k, p19 and Cnb p15.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in dengue virus (DENV) infection. They found that pDCs from mildeng patients exhibited higher frequencies of membrane-bound TRAIL (mTR) compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IF-α and soluble TR were increased in mild compared to severe deng patients, correlating with p activation. In vitro, exposure to DENV-2 induced mTR expression on p and relocalized it from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-induced mTR relocalization and IFα production by p. Endosomal degradation by chloro allowed viral antigens detection inside p, suggesting endocyt pathway activation by D-2 in p. Coculture of p/D-2-infected monocytes showed reduced antigen detection, which was also observed after exogenous IFα treatment, indicating p effect on viral load was mainly dependent on IFα production.
A study investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TN) in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection using a computational approach. TN plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. TN-neutralizing drugs, used to treat inflammatory disorders, have increased the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in accordance with animal studies. The study extended previous mathematical models to investigate the roles of soluble (sTN) and transmembrane TN (tmTN) and analyzed the effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual trials by simulating two commonly used therapies, anti-T antibody and TN receptor. The findings suggest that bioavailability of TN following anti-T therapy is the primary cause of reactivation of latent infection and that TN, even at low levels, is essential for control of infection. A mathematical model distinguished the mechanisms of action of anti-T treatments and provided insights into the role of TN in TB and pathology. The study suggests a TN-modulating agent could balance reduction of inflammation with maintenance of resistance to infection. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-T therapy could be modified.
Researchers investigated population differences in retrogene loss and expression in humans using data from the 1000 Genomes Project and RNA-Seq data from the Geuvis Consortium. They developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the human genome and experimentally confirmed the existence of 193 retroduplication variations (RDVs) in 17 populations. Most RDVs resulted from retrocopy deletion, with a majority not previously reported. Expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes was confirmed in certain individuals, with low frequency of deletion, except for one. Expression and deletion rate of remaining retro may suggest functionality. Differences in retro expression between populations were also found, with 9 retrogenes undergoing significant differential expression.

The study analyzed 4,927 retrocopies from RetroDB and genomic data from 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, identifying 214 indels affecting 190 retrocopies. The role of retro polymorphisms as markers for population history is established, but findings suggest they also provide insight into ongoing evolutionary processes. RNA-Seq data from Geuvis allowed studying changes in retro sequences and potential implications.
A study investigated the effect of the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain on the inflammatory response to praziquel treatment in pigs with neurocysticercosis. Histological specimens from 11 naturally infected pigs were analyzed, with cysterci located in the parenchym, meninges, or both. Pigs were treated with prazantel for 2 or 5 days, or left untreated. Evans blue dye was injected to assess blood-brain barrier disruption. Inflammation was scored based on photomicrographs. Parenchymal cysterci had higher inflammation after treatment compared to meningeal and corteningal cystic. Meningeal cystic inflammation was not affected by treatment. Corteningal cystic inflammation correlated with cystic proximity to parenym. Blood-brain barrier disruption was only in parenym tissue. Meningal inflammation was lower than parenymal.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 30 communities in two districts of Ghana where azithrom mass administration for trach control had previously taken place. Children aged 5-17 with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled. Samples for treponemal serology and PCR were collected from all children. 90 with 98 lesions were enrolled. Syphilis serology was negative in all of them. PCR for T. pallum sp pertue was negative in children but Haemophil duyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. In communities previously treated for trach, no evidence of ongoing y transmission was found. H. duyi was associated with a proportion of lesions but majority remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic into pre and post-M surveillance is required for better y control.
Researchers have identified a potential new approach to combat HIV persistence by targeting the Jak-STAT pathway, a key regulator of T cell homeostasis, which drives HIV reservoir establishment and maintenance. Two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxitin, were tested in vitro to block seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir. Results showed that Jak inhibitors reduced the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA and blocked viral production from infected cells, preventing transmission to bystander T cells. The study demonstrated that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence in vivo and that inhibitors target key events downstream of cytokine (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15) ligation to receptors, impacting the magnitude of the reservoir in all CD4 T subsets. In vitro and ex vivo, Jak inhibitors impeded cell activation and proliferation critical for HIV replication and reservoir seeding without affecting effector CD4 and CD8 responses. The Jak-STAT pathway was inhibited in all T subsets known to harbor HIV, and inhibitors conferred block STAT-mediated homeostatic proliferation and inflammation-driven reservoir expansion. In a cohort of aviremic participants, the association between Jak-STAT and HIV persistence was confirmed, with frequencies of cells with integrated DNA.
Researchers studied the immune response of Spodoptera exigua larvae to two different types of baculoviruses, SeNP and AcNP, using microarray analysis. Contrary to the expected transcription shutdown, the larvae showed a balanced number of up and down-regulated genes in the first 36 hours after infection. Immune-related genes, including pattern recognition, signaling, and effector proteins involved in melanization were downregulated. This downregulation was confirmed in the larval gut, where immune-related genes affect the gut microbiota, responsible for growth and development. The researchers hypothesized that this downregulation affects the gut microbiota load, observing an increase in bacterial load after infection. Experiments with and without microbiota revealed that bacteria enhanced baculirus virulence and pathogenicity. The study discusses host response pathways affected by baculiruses and the role of microbiota in infection.
Researchers have identified a novel gene that controls the transition from meiosis to mitosis in plants, a key component of apomix, a type of asexual reproduction. By combining this gene with two others that affect meiotic processes, they created a genotype called Mi, where meiosis is replaced by mitosis. Mi plants produce functional diploid gametes identical to their mother. This is a step towards understanding and engineering apomix. Apom can be separated into three components: absence or alteration of meiosis, fertilization-independent embryo development, and endosperm initiation without fertilization. In the Mi genotype, meiosis is completely replaced by mit-like division, resulting in fully penetrant apomesis. The Atspo-1 and At8 mutations lead to mit-like first meiotic division, while os1 prevents second meiotic division. Mi plants produce dyads and are fertile with quasi-wild levels of viable ovules and pollen. Previous apomesis in Arabidopsis was reported, but only 0.2% of dyadules generated viable gametes. In contrast, Mi plants produce quasi-wild levels of viable ovules and pollen. All gametes tested retained mother heterozygosity for genetic markers and were genetically identical to the mother. This confirms Mi undergoes mitosis instead of meiosis without affecting sexual processes. When meiosis is replaced by mitosis, ploidy doubles with each generation.
Researchers have developed a new approach to prioritize disease-causing genes by incorporating tissue-specific information into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods rely on a static picture of human PIs, which may not accurately reflect tissue-specific interactions. The study constructed tissue-specific PIs for 60 human tissues using gene expression data and found that they improve prioritization results compared to generic P networks. Tissue-specific PIs also predict novel disease-tissue associations, revealing subclinical effects that may be missed. In cases where the disease gene is expressed in the associated tissue, integrating tissue information into prioritization improves accuracy. Tissue-specific PIs were generated using gene expression data from healthy tissues and applied to prioritize genes for liver and brain diseases, despite their distinct molecular landscapes. The algorithm was applied to both original and tissue PIs in a cross-validation setting, showing tissue-specific PIs yielded higher area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and correct gene ranking. The method was extended to infer diseaseissue associations by constructing tissue PIs and using generic networks. A majority (71-83%) of known disease-causing genes are expressed in disease-associated tissues, supporting the hypothesis that a gene is likely expressed in a tissue for its mutation to manifest. Tissue information was added for various diseases, enabling tissue-specific inference of causing genes. The PRCE algorithm was used for prioritization and contrasted generic and tissue PIs, finding tissue-specific enhanced performance. Two methods for tissue P construction yielded different prioritization performance.
Researchers have developed a two-locus model to study the evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit human diseases such as malaria. The model accounts for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide and allows selection pressures and dominance to vary depending on the concentration encountered. They applied the model to investigate the merits of sequential versus mixture use of insecticides to minimize resistance spread. Results showed that mixtures outperformed sequential use in 24% of runs, while 56% favored sequential and 44 favored mixtures. Mixtures are favored when insect effectiveness is high and exposure is low. If insect does not reliably kill homozygous genotypes, sequential may be more robust. Resistance spreads slower with mixture, but may not outperform sequential. For example, a mixture may last 5 years while individual insecticides last 3-4 years, giving 7 years lifespan for sequential. The model can identify control strategies to minimize resistance spread. A decision may be made to delay new insect until another is available for a mixture with low resistance. A wider parameter space was investigated, indicating performance depends on insect, application, behavior, and genetics. Mixtures favored higher effectiveness and lower exposure. A metric was used to plot variables affecting time to resistance, showing separation between runs. The strategy is favored lower exposure and higher effectiveness.
Researchers have investigated the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a triatomine bug that transmits Chagas disease, to understand its role in vector-host interactions. Next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry were used to identify proteins in the saliva. 4,230 DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank, and 636 coding sequences of putative secretory proteins were extracted, with 73 confirmed by proteomic analysis. The saliva of R. neglect was characterized by serine protease transcripts and presence of ubiquitous protein families, including lipocalin, serine protease inhibitors, antigen-5 metalloproteases, disins, and odorant binding proteins. These findings improve understanding of hematophagous arthropod saliva and interactions with vertebrate hosts. R. neglect is a secondary vector of T. cruzi, causative of Chagas disease, and analysis of salivary secret products may be involved in vector-host interactions similar to other triatine species. Deep sequencing increases possibilities of finding new molecules in saliva of blood-sucking insects, offering substances for further investigation. The study cataloged transcripts of R. neglect SG with probable function in hematagy using RNA and spectrometry. Secreted proteins were organized in subclasses, including known families in hematag saliva, such as lipin, nitroph, antigen-5, and families not reported in triine, such as serinease and disintegr.
Researchers used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study the interaction between nematodes and bacteria in soil. They employed transcriptional profiling to identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to bacteria isolated from grassland soils. Many of the identified genes are involved in metabolism and immunity, suggesting they may influence nemat community dynamics in natural systems. Mutations in 21 of these genes showed they contribute to lifespan and fitness in specific bacterial environments. Although the bacteria are not a natural food source for C. elegans, changes in food source due to environmental disturbance can affect gene expression and fitness. Regression analysis demonstrated that the degree of differential expression between environments predicts the effect of gene loss on life traits in those environments.
Researchers have investigated the role of gene expression noise in the development of the mammalian blastocyst, a critical event in mammalian embryo formation. Using multi-scale modeling, they found that stochasticity in gene expression promotes cell plasticity and plays a crucial role in accurately organizing the blastocyst. Asymmetry in the levels of variation of Cdx2 and Oct4 expression provides a means to benefit from noise-mediated plasticity while mitigating detrimental effects of stochasticity. By controlling the timing and pace of cell specification, the embryo modulates plasticity, creating a window for cells to continually read their environment and adjust fate. These results suggest noise has a crucial role in maintaining plasticity and organizing the blastyst.

 Combined results support the hypothesis that gene noise has a positive influence on TE/ICM organization and adds robustness to the correct arrangement of mouse blastysts. Studies indicate an inherent asymmetry in the system, with noise introducing perturbations leading to a switch from an undesirable to a more stable state. The regulatory model is a plausible mechanism to organize the embryo, but results indicate noise helps deal with ambiguities and imperfections central to it. Asymmetries in noise sources provide a mechanism to promote plasticity without overwhelming dynamics. Mammalian fate is a gradual process, providing a window for noise to fix errors. This suggests induced plasticity improves organization.

 Results are consistent with modeling that noise in C2 expression improves organization, while Oct expression does not. With modeling predictions, it is concluded that noise in the appropriate range promotes proper organization of the embryo.
Researchers have investigated the ability of germline-encoded antibodies to bind to diverse antigens. They found that germl-encoded antibodies can bind to multiple antigens due to their structural flexibility, which increases with somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells. The study used the Rosetta multi-state design process to predict antibody sequences for the heavy chain region, including framework, CDR, and CDR mutations. Predicted sequences matched germl gene to a remarkable degree, revealing residues enabling polyspecific binding. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned similar to mature sequence, mimicking natural maturation. The Rosetta design captures aspects of antibody-antigen recognition, while CDR mediates specificity, but VH, CDR, and immunoglobulin framework contribute to polyspecificity in germl antibodies. Designing antibodies to bind multiple antigens may retain polyspecific for diverse epitope binding.
Locusts exhibit two interchangeable behavioral phases: solitar and gregar. Solitar individuals are repelled by other locusts, while gregar insects are attracted to conspecifics and form large aggregations such as hopper bands. Biological experiments at the individual level have shown crowding biases towards the gregar form. To understand hopper band formation, a partial integrodifferential model was constructed incorporating interplay between phase change and movement at the individual level to predict population dynamics. Stability analysis revealed conditions for an outbreak, characterized by large transition to gregar phase. The model enabled quantification of temporal dynamics of each phase, proportion of population that will gregarize, and time for this to occur. Numerical simulations described aggregation's structure, revealing transient clumps of gregar insects. Predictions suggest possible biological experiments.

The problem was addressed via mathematical modeling to quantify collective gregar, a key process before destructive locust outbreak. A continuum model was constructed for phase interacting gregar and solitar locs, classifying dynamics in wide parameter space. In low densities, phases were uniformly spread and solitar dominated. For large populations, a dense gregar patch emerged, solitar became scarce. Clustering at high densities was identified with hop band onset. Analysis calculated critical density for gregar formation and final ratio gregar to solitar. Behavioral is plastic and dependent on density: gregar transitions to solitar in sparse, vice versa in crowded environments. This dependence is summarized in Fig.2. Analysis yielded most unstable spacing from wave modes. Numerical simulations illustrated rapid transitions once gregar initiated, dense gregar packs formed, sweeping sol in vicinity.
Researchers have characterized an intermediate structure in the fusion process of flaviviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis, by exposing virus particles to alkaline pH instead of acidic conditions. This allowed them to trap the virus in an intermediate conformation where the fusion protein E dimer dissociates and interacts with the target membrane, but does not proceed to merge the membranes. Further treatment to low pH leads to fusion, suggesting these monomers correspond to an elusive intermediate required to convert the pre-fusion dimer to post-fusion trimer. The use of non-physiological conditions enabled the dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and identification of two separate steps: membrane insertion of multiple E monomers precedes formation of hair-like trimers. This sequence provides new insights into the dynamic of viral membrane fusion.
Researchers have investigated the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot. They compared Red List data for the British and South African floras and found that taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs between regions, inconsistent with a trait-based model of extinction. A phylogenetic analysis of the Cape flora revealed a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant risks, but most threatened species cluster at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Analyzing 11 exemplar clades, they suggest speciation best explains the phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. Results show that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages, not explained by correlations with simple traits, and most vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects. The study has implications for conservation and casts doubt on the utility of Red List criteria for regions with rapid speciation, aiming to preserve the tree-of-life.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (TK) and Vav, that interact with the major phagoc receptor Dectin-1 in macrophages to facilitate the phocytosis of the opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans. During phocytosis, TK and Vav are recruited to the phocytic cup surrounding the Candida hyphae, while Dect-1 lines the full length of the phagosome. TK and Vav colocalize with the lipid PI (3, 4, 5)P3 and F-act at the phocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol DAG which marks mature phagosomes. A selective TK inhibitor showed that TK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phytic cup and subsequent recruitment of PKε. TK or Vav-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in Candida albicans phocytosis and bone-derived macrophages lacking TK or V1 show reduced Candida uptake comparable to Dect1-deficient cells. TK or V1-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic Candida infection than wild-type mice.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans, which heavily impacted Madagascar in 2008-2009. To optimize available resources for RV surveillance, identifying at-risk environments is essential. This study aimed to identify environmental and human factors favoring RV transmission in cattle and humans in Madagascar. Environmental factors were characterized using Multiple Factor Analysis (FA), and cattle and human serological data analyzed using Generalized Mixed Models. Cattle and human seroprevalence were positively associated with humid environments (p<0.001) and high cattle density (p<0.01, OR=2.6). Frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection (OR=1.6). The study highlighted eastern, western, and northwestern parts as high-risk areas for RV transmission in cattle. An integrated analysis of environmental and human datasets provided new insights on RV transmission patterns in Madagascar. The association between serrevalence, humid environments, and cattle density suggests conitant vector and direct transmissions are critical for RV enzotic transmission. In at-risk environments, western, northwestern, and eastern areas, suitable Cx Anopheles mosquitoes vector transmission occurs in cattle and humans.
Researchers investigated the transmission of the prion state between non-identical proteins, specifically between homologous proteins from different species, and found that transmission barriers are attributed to sequence differences in pr proteins but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. They used a yeast Rq1/PIN-based system to explore the nature of transmission. The prion form Rq is common in wild and laboratory yeast strains and facilitates the appearance of other prions. Rq's pr domain has four Q-rich regions, and multiple prion determinants can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the prion state in vivo. Analysis of PIN transmission between Rq fragments with different pr determinants established that one Q-rich region is required and sufficient for transmission, but transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. The existence of barriers in the absence of amino mismatches in regions indicates complex pr domains pr determinants cooperatively attain the pr conformation and transmission determined by cooperative fold.

The PIN pr domain is located in the Q-rich C-terminus, but one Q region in Rq is not essential for the pr state, suggesting Rq carries multiple determinants capable of supporting pr. Bacterially expressed Rq fragments lacking three of four Q regions were tested for propensity to form amy in vitro. Q1's inability to maintain pr is not unexpected, as region corresponds roughly half other regions length lacks oligopeptide and residues hypothesized facilitate fragmentation amy aggregates. Pr strains manifest pr conformations same protein, despite sequence, have transmission barriers. In vitro and genetic data indicate large pr domains define differences. PIN stands among yeast as found industrial pathogenic isolates, while PSI and URE are common laboratory. Saccharomyces cerevisiae three epetic factors PSI, URE, and PIN manifest self-peruating amy conformations Sup, Ure and Rq, respectively. The pr nature factors established genetic criteria Wick, proof protein transmission obtained infecting cells vitro Sup, U or R amyloids.
Researchers have developed a novel, likelihood-free framework for inferring complex genetic models from genomic data using deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique. This approach bypasses the computational infeasibility of traditional methods by using multilayer neural networks to learn a feature function from input data (e.g., hundreds of summary statistics) to output (e.g., population parameters of interest). The method is demonstrated for jointly inferring natural selection and demography (population size history) in Drosila melanogaster from 197 African genomes, separating demography from selection without sequential steps. Demography and selection are confounded in Drosilaogaster, making joint inference challenging. The method finds regions of the genome under hard sweeps, soft, and balancing selection, with soft and balancing occurring closer to the centromere. Demographic inference suggests previously estimated bottlenecks for Dilaogaster are too extreme. Deep learning provides a way to distinguish informative from uninformative statistics and has been applied to neuroscience and biology, but not population genetics. It accommodates complex models and is a complimentary to likelihood-free inference in genetics. The method can be used to select statistics for ABC or other methods, such as hierarchical ABC or SVM. Other approaches are possible, and it is unclear which would produce most accurate results. Using deep to classify regions as neutral or selected is appealing for demographic inference.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway by impairing localization and deubiquination of FANCD2. Persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogen is necessary for the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. E6/E7 expressing cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing interstrand crosslinks (ICL). The study elucidates how E/E7 attenuates the FA pathway. E7 activates the pathway by increasing FAN2 monoubiquination and foci formation but inhibits completion of repair by multiple mechanisms. E7 impairs FAN colocalization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering recruitment of downstream protein Rad51 to DS in E cells. Further, E causes delayed F deubiquination, an important for ICL repair. Delayed F deubination is associated with chromatin retention of F, hindering US1 deubiquinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/p565 F signaling. E mediated p53 degradation does not hamper cell cycle process of F modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting deubination. E reduces and foci formation of Pal2, a protein downstream of F.
In the Southern Chiapas focus of Mexico, one of the major onchocerciasis foci in Latin America, 559 communities have undergone semi-annual ivermect treatment since 1998. In 50 communities, iverectin frequency shifted to twice a year in 2003, and an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly regimen in 2009 to achieve rapid suppression. Epidemiologic and entomologic assessments were conducted in six sentinel communities with 2 rounds of iverectin per year and three extra-sent with 4 rounds per year. No Simulium ochum l collected during the dry season 201 were found to contain parasite DNA by PCR-ELISA, resulting in an upper bound of 95% confidence interval of infectivity of 0.06/2,000 flies. Serological testing on 4,230 children under 5 years old revealed 2/4,230 exposed to Ovolulus (0.05%). The findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community. The Onchias Elimination Program aims to eliminate ocular morbidity and transmission in 13 foci in Latin America. The Southern focus population (114,024) comprises 21% of the Americas at-risk population. Annual iverect distribution began in 1994, modified to every 6 months in 1998. In Chiapas, iverect was initially offered to cases, then to eligible residents in hyperemic and hypoemic communities, and 40% in hypoemic from 1995-1997. 22 rounds reaching 85% of eligible have been provided over 11 years, with 85% coverage every year 199-201.
Listeria monocytogen, a Gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen, invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cytos. A transcription activator PrA regulates gene products for intracellular growth and bacterial spread. However, the signal stimulating PrA activation has not been defined. Here, evidence is provided for L monocytogen secretion of a peptide pherone, pA, which enhances escape from host vacoles and may facilitate PrA activation. pA pherone is generated via proteolytic processing of P lipoprotein signal. P lipop is dispensable for pathogenesis, but bacteria lacking pA pher are attenuated for virulence in mice with reduced efficiency of escape from vacoles of nonphagocytic cells. Mut activation of PrA restores virulence and eliminates need for pA signaling. Experimental evidence suggests pA may signal monocogen presence within vacole, stimulating expression of products contributing to escape and PrA to promote growth within cytos.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Vibrio cholera, the causative agent of cholera, adapts to oxidative stress during infection in the host. They used a whole-genome transposon sequencing (T-seq) analysis to compare gene requirements for colonization in mice with and without antioxidant treatment, N-acetyl cystine. The study found that mutants of the methyl-directed repair system, such as MutS, showed significant colonization advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in N-treated mice. Further analysis suggested that accumulation of catalase-producing and rugose variants in N- mice was due to Mut mutant enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. Rugose variants could revert to smooth colonies in aerobic in vitro. Mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N- mice was higher than in N+ mice. The findings support a paradigm where Vibrio employs a temporal strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. Additionally, Mut passage and complementation can model hypermutation in diverse pathogens to identify stress mechanisms.
Researchers studied the function of Mlh3 in baker's yeast, a protein involved in meiotic recombination and mismatch repair (MMR). They analyzed 6 new Mlh alleles, 5 of which disrupted MMR and 1 that specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. The researchers purified and characterized 2 representatives of each class, Mlh-32 (MR+, crossover-) and Mlh-45 (MR-, crossover+). Both displayed wild-type endonuc activities in vitro, but M2sh, an M complex that acts with Mlh in MMR, stimulated the endon activity of Mlh-32 but not Mlh-45, suggesting M-45 is defective in M interactions. Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type, M+ crossover, M- crossover, endonuc defective and Mlh mutants in S288/Y789 background. Compared to wild, all Mlh mutants showed increases in non-crossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative pathways. The study provides a structure-function map for Mlh, revealing importance of protein-protein interactions regulating Mlh's enzymatic activity and how meiotic components can alter fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing insights into regulation of meiotic pathways.
A study investigated the impact of host population structure on the reversion to drug sensitivity after treatment discontinuation in diseases such as tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and gonorrhea. Resistance to antibiotics has increased due to intense use, necessitating new drug switches and discontinuation of older ones, which often results in slow or persistent resistance decline. Researchers found that host heterogeneity in the number of contacts also plays a role in reversion dynamics. During treatment, host structure leads to non-random distribution of resistant strains among the population, and after discontinuation, affects competition dynamics, mitigating fitness advantages. This results in lower reversion rate and probability on population level after treatment stopped. Simulations showed heterogeneity's impact is maximal in biologically plausible range when fitness costs are small. 

The study confirmed contact heterogeneity lowers reversion probability, even with substantial sensitive pathogen population at treatment stop time. Large strain differences between sensitive and resistant result in non-trivial distribution over network, influencing reversion once treatment stopped. Costs are generally small for many pathogen-drug combinations, biologically relevant range is where effects expected largest. Fitness variance affects reversion probability and shifts closer to 1 with system size. During treatment, resistant infections increase, sensitive decline. Once resistant risen to critical, treatment stopped, no new resistance generated, dynamics governed by wild-type and resistant in absence. Heterogeneity modulates reversion strongest biologically when differences small.
Researchers investigated the role of combinatorial effects of genetic variants in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by examining the interactions between Drosila orthologs of genes affected by de novo copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with autism. They found synergistic interactions between pairs of candidate genes whose orthologs were jointly affected by large CNVs, including a 22q11.2 deletion. Dosage alterations of Dila orthologs of candidate genes from single CNs displayed neurological defects similar to previously reported Dila models of ASD variants. Pairwise changes of orthologs affected by the same CN showed significant synergistic effects, with concordant phenotypic outcomes across interacting pairs. The study demonstrated specificity and transitivity between interactors within and between CN candidate sets, supporting shared and distinct etiologies. Different interactions affected divergent processes, demonstrating molecular etiologies. The study illustrates how synergistic effects from structural variation contribute to disease.
Researchers investigated the role of brain-infiltrating CD8 T cells in experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) caused by Plasmodium berghei AN infection in C57/6 mice. They used intravital two-photon microscopy and ex vivo flow cytometry to show that CD8 T cells accumulate in the perascular spaces of the brain during both ECM-inducing (P berg AN) and non-inducing ( berg NK) infections. However, perascular T cells displayed arrested behavior specifically during P berg AN infection, despite exhibiting comparable activation phenotypes during both infections. The cells formed long-term interactions with CXCR1-bearing antigen-presenting cells within the brain during P AN infection, but depletion of these cells did not prevent ECM development. Pathogenic CD T cells colocalized with apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, but apoptosis was rare and did not result in loss of vasculature or disruption. The study found that arrest of T in perascular compartments is a signature of ECM-inducing infection, implying an important role in ECM development.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 21 villages in 3 sub-locations of Viga County, Kenya to determine the burden of tungias, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga. A total of 437 participants aged 5 years and above were clinically examined for the presence of tungias after consenting to participate. The overall prevalence was 21.5% (95% CI 17.7-25.3). Cases were visualized in a map. Multivariate analysis suggested occurrence of tungias was associated with low economic status, including monthly income ≤ Ksh 100 (adjusted OR 27.85, 95% CI 4.13-187.59), earthen floor (0.36, 0.13-1.024), lack of toilet facilities (4.27,0.82-22.34), age ≤14 (27.414,10.02-74.99), no use of closed footwear (1.98,0.987-3.97), and resting inside house (1.93,0.96-3.89). Tungias is an important health problem in Viga due to economic status of people. Factors point to poverty contribute occurrence of tungias. Control strategies need to be cost-effective and accessible. Tungis is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries, with unknown burden worldwide. In Kenya, studies documented prevalence between 19-40%. Children and elderly bear brunt of infection. Tungis neglected due to poverty, poor housing, sanitation, and animal contact. Not recognized by WHO. Communities trapped in vicious cycle of poverty and disease.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the interaction between auxin and cytokinin hormones in Arabidopsis root patterning. The model considers the regulation of auxin transport within a spatial context, taking into account cell shape and polarity and cell walls. Analysis reveals that a spatial pattern of cytokinin generated by diffusion is unlikely and not required for correct auxin patterning. Instead, aux-dependent modification of cytokinin response, rather than variations in cytokinin levels, allows for feedback that amplifies and stabilizes auxin. The model demonstrates the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for robustness and predicts a role of AUX and LAX2 aux influx transporters in vascular patterning. Localisation of PIN generates an aux flux that stabilizes accumulation within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for aux to accumulate in xylem-pericycle cells, an early step in lateral root initiation. Pericycle cells opposite xyle poles compete for aux accumulation, consistent with lateral roots not initiated opposite each other. The model is an extension of a previous longitudinal aux transport model and considers regulation of transport under control of aux and cytokinin. It identifies a novel role for active aux influx and connection between subcell polarity and robustness at tissue level. Insights into transverse aux transport dynamics play a role in constructing three-dimensional models of aux transport and growth in Arabidopsis.
Researchers have identified a key mediator in the neuropeptide F (N)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway that regulates phase-related locomotor plasticity in migratory locusts, Locusta migratoria. The conserved transcription factor, cAMP response-element binding protein B (CRE-B), directly activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression by interacting with the N promoter region. Phosphorylation of serine 110 on CRE-B changes in response to population density and is negatively controlled by N2. The involvement of CRE-B in N2-regulated locomotor plasticity is validated by RNA interference and behavioral assays. Protein kinase A mediates the effects of N2 on CRE-B phosphorylation and OS transcription. The study reveals a precise cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity. CRE-B acts as a key mediator in the N/NO pathway, regulating locomotor plasticity through direct control of OS under N2 regulation and PK transmits effects of N2 on CRE-B.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos, specifically during the maternal-to-zyotic transition (MT), a period when the zotic genome is activated after fertilization. They used chromatin immunoprecitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (Ch-Seq) to map regions bound by Z before, during, and after the MT. Prior to MT, only a few genes are transcribed, but thousands of regions are bound by Z, most of which remain through MT. Expectedly, early Z-bound regions include promoters and enhancers of transcribed genes at this stage. However, Z is also bound to promoters of genes first transcribed at MT and enhancers of transcription factors that regulate gene activation during MT. The association between Z binding and MT is strong, allowing Z to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity. This suggests Z is not only required for earliest transcription but also plays a role in activating genome at MT.
Researchers have identified 109 novel protein-protein interactions (PPI) among circadian clock proteins using a yeast-two-hybrid approach, including the interaction between phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL, which results in BM1 destabilization. A dynamic circadian PPI network was constructed using circadian expression data, predicting P timing of interactions. Systematic circadian phenotyping (RNAi and overexpression) suggests a crucial role for components in dynamic interactions. Analysis of a global network in liver revealed interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, likely restricting interactions to specific phases. Circadian PIs dynamically connect many cellular processes (signal transduction, cell cycle, etc.) contributing to temporal organization in an unprecedented manner.

The study provides a systems-wide view of circadian P dynamics, not restricted to specific processes or phases. Novel PIs modulate CLOCK/BMAL function, indicating a role for phosphatase 1 in BM1 regulation. A comprehensive network was generated by enriching with validated interactions and literature partners, some essential for circadian dynamics. Timing of gene expression, protein interactions, and post-translational modifications are essential for sustaining circadian dynamics. The study highlights the importance of precisely timed PIs for the circadian clock, but a comprehensive view of P network and dynamics is still lacking.
Researchers have solved the three-dimensional structure of ABA-1, a repeating unit of the nematode polyallergen (NPA) protein from Ascaris su, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein adopts a novel seven-helical fold with a central helix and two four-hel bundles on either side. Two discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, with amino acid chains affected by ligand (fatty acid) binding identified. Recombinant A-1 contains tightly-bound ligands of bacterial origin in one of its binding sites. This is the first post-translationally processed unit of a tandemly repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source and belongs to a new class. Nematodes have no counterparts in vertebrates, representing potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. The nature of the unidentified ligands may be pertinent to this, as characterization of the unusual sites.

Ascar and filarial nemat parasites have a simplified array of N units with predominantly identical or similar amino sequences, unlike other nematodes or free-living species with diverse sequences. NAs are immunodominant and allergenic in nemat infections, with no consensus features making a protein more or less allergenic. The structure may contribute to elucidation of a consensus for infection-associated allergens. Several disease-causing nemodes express NAs with strong immune responses, often hypersensitivities. The tandem unit of Ascar A-1 NPA is a lipid protein of novel structure with two sites differing character, probably hydrophobic or amphipathic ligands. One site is populated with a high-affinity ligand in recombinant, possibly from bacterial cultures. NAs have affinity for pharmacologically lipids or precursors, suggesting sequestration delivery may subvert host response.
Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39,677 reported cases of ciguater poisoning in 17 Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PITCs), with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100,000 people. This represents a 60% increase from the reported incidence of 104 per 100,000 between 1973 and 1983. Accounting for underreporting, an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from cigater in the last 35 years. Ciguater is a type of poisoning caused by consuming coral fish contaminated with cigatoxin, a toxin produced by dinoflagates and cyanobacteria. Symptoms include acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, with some experiencing chronic neuro symptoms lasting weeks to months. Cigu is underdiagnosed and underreported, with only 2-10% of cases reported to health authorities. The incidence of cigater in Oceania has ranged from 0. Cigu is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in ITs, and temperate regions due to travel and coral fish export. The toxin bioaccumulates in the food web through incidental uptake by herbivorous or carnivorous fish. Presently, cigato can only be detected in fish and Gambdisc in specialized labs, and diagnosis in humans is based on symptoms associated with recent consumption of potential cigater fish.
A study investigated the impact of benznazole treatment on the functional response of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific CD4+CD+ T cells in chronic Chagas disease patients. Thirty-eight patients with chronic Chagas disease (20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic) and twelve healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble T cruzi antigens to analyze cytokine and cytotoxic molecule production by CD+CD+ cells before and after benidazole treatment. Expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors in patients after treatment were studied using multiparameter flow cytometry. The frequency of CD+CD+ cells was higher in Chagas patients compared to healthy donors, with a higher ratio of CD+CDlow/CD+CDhigh subpopulations. CD+ cells expressed co-expressed higher inhibitory receptors in proportion to disease severity. Benidazole reduced frequency CD+CD cells and decreased ratio CDCD/CDhigh subpop. Co-expression of inhibitory was reduced after treatment with enhancement multifunctional capacity CD+CD cells. Treatment increased frequency T cruzi-specific CD+CD cells expressing IL-2 and TN-α. CD+ cells produced effector molecules for parasite control. Benidazole partially reversed exhaustion caused by T cruz infection in cells with improved response T cruzi-specific CD+CD cells.
Researchers have identified Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoinide-specific phospholipase 2 (AtPLC2) as the primary enzyme responsible for phosphoinide metabolism and involved in seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. Lipid profiling of multiple PLC mutants showed increased levels of substrates phosphidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating impaired phosphide metabolic pathway. AtC displayed distinct tissue expression and localization at the plasma membrane in different cell types where phosphide signaling occurs. Seedlings of PLC-1 mutant showed growth defects complemented by heterologous expression of AtC, suggesting phosphide-specific phospholase activity by AtC is required for seed growth. Moreover, PLC-1 mutant showed hypersensitivity to ER stress evidenced by changes in phenotypes and gene profiles. The study revealed primary enzyme phosphide metabolism, involvement in seedling and emerging link between phosphide and ER response.
Researchers challenge the reductionist assumption that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power-integrated (Φ) and showing that macro-level systems can have higher cause power than micro-level systems. They evaluate simple systems across spatial and temporal scales by considering all possible black boxes, which are macro elements consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more updates. Cause power is based on inputs and outputs of the boxes, ignoring internal elements supporting their input-output function. Results show black boxes can have more inputs and outputs than micro elements, revealing emergent mechanisms and constraints not apparent at micro. Macro-box systems can have higher Φ than micro constituents with more interconnected mechanisms. For a given system, local maxima of Φ can be identified across spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a biological system, the Boolean model of fission yeast cell cycle, identifying local maxima during its simulated function. These max correspond to levels of organization where emergent cause properties come into focus, providing a natural point for scientific inquiry. The authors use intrinsic cause power as a quantification of causal, refuting the reductionist assumption that power resides exclusively at micro. Evaluating black systems across spatiemp scales shows local max of macro power, with integrated information decreasing to zero. Local max capture emergent roles of macro elements, corresponding to system descriptions as NOR, OR, AND, or MAJ elements.
Researchers investigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) to understand their role in cellular adaptation and damage under hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions. They extended a model of complex III to account for electron transport, proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential, TCA reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. Measurements of electron flux in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate, pyruvate, and malate, and NAD reduction by reverse transport from succinate through complex I provided insight into ROS formation mechanisms. Analysis revealed association of ROS with specific electron transporters and their combinations in complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability in complex III was found to be valid for the whole RC. Conditions for switching to a state with high free radicals in III were predicted and confirmed. The study provides new insights into ROS production mechanisms in RC. ROS are products of electron transport in mitochondria, starting with superoxide formation from oxygen and free radicals. Superoxide is deactivated by superoxide dismutase. Inhibition of reverse transport by roten decreases ROS in succ-fueled mitochondria. Measurements showed ROS inhibition after roone addition. Sets with good fit data define patterns for radicals in I and III, giving insight into respiration and ROS.
Researchers have investigated the impact of mutations in motor proteins on intracellular transport, which is essential for cellular function. Motor proteins convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of cargo over long distances. Disruptions in transport mechanisms, caused by mutations altering motor characteristics, lead to neurodegenerative diseases. For example, phosphorylation of the kines motor domain at serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease. This study examines the effects of mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by wild-type and mutant motors. Results show that mutants with altered stall forces determine average velocity and run-length, even when outnumbered by wild motors in the ensemble. Mutants gain a competitive advantage and increase run-length when the load is near the mutant's stalling or multiple of stalling force. A semi-analytical method was developed to analyze transport by multiple motors of types, determining transition rates between configurations and computing biologically relevant quantities like velocity and run-length without Monte Carlo simulations. This method can model alterations and deduce effects on transport by multiple motors. The technique is implementable and a software package is provided.
Researchers investigated the role of the CAC1 gene in operant learning by selectively ablating the gene in mice and analyzing their behavior on a 2-choice operant discrimination task. The task required mice to perform a nose poke response on one side of a touchscreen based on the position of a stimulus on the screen. Results showed that C1 knockout mice did not impair learning in general, but instead adapted an outcome-based strategy, whereas controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association. This suggests a specific role of the gene in learning and highlights the importance of examining response patterns in a repertoire of behavioral strategies. The study also has implications for treating psychiatric disorders associated with CAC1, as it has been implicated in their pathophysiology.
Aedes aegypt mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria are being released worldwide for arbovirus suppression, but their potential to invade and persist depends on environmental conditions, particularly temperature fluctuations. Researchers reared Ae aegypt larvae with different Wolia types (Mel, wMelB, and wMel-CLA) under diurnal temperatures. Results showed that rearing Mel and Mel-CLA-infected larvae at 26-37°C reduced cytoplasmic incompatibility expression and Wolia density in adults. Additionally, Mel and Mel-CLA infections were not transmitted to the next generation when exposed to 26-37°C across life stages. In contrast, wB infection maintained high density, exhibited cytoplasm incompatibility, and transmitted to offspring with high fidelity under this temperature. These findings have implications for Wolia interventions across environments and highlight temperature control in rearing.
Researchers isolated and characterized adenoviruses from the gastrointestinal tracts of non-human primates, including great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) and macaques. The study found that these animals shed substantial quantities of infectious adeniruses in their stools, with shedding rates ranging from 22-38% among chimpanzees, bonos, and gorillas. In contrast, the rate of adenirus shedding in asymptomatic humans was less frequent, comparable to previously reported frequencies. The researchers purified and sequenced 30 adeniruses from apes and 3 adeniruses from macques. Analysis of the new adenirus sequences, along with 4 chimpanzee adenirus previously reported and 22 adenirus genomes from GenBank, revealed that ape adeniruses could be classified into species corresponding human adenirus B, C, and E. There was evidence of intraspecies recombination adeniruses and high phylogenetic relatedness adenir across primate hosts, suggesting cross-species transmission events occurred. The high asymptomatic shedding of adenirus in non-human primates and zoonotic transmissions warrant caution for primate handling. The presence of persistent or latent adenirus in the gut should be considered in design and interpretation of human and non-primate adenirus studies.
Researchers have investigated the process of unwrapping the outer helical turn of nucleosomal DNA, a fundamental to various cellular processes, using molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling. They calculated the free energy profiles for unwrapping and found a value of approximately 11.5 kcal/mol, consistent with single-molecule experiments. The simulations revealed multiple conformational states indicating various paths to unwrapping, with a dominant asymmetric path at one end of the DNA. Initially, five base pairs unwrap, followed by a second five at the same end with increased energy. Unwrapping then starts at the other end, unwrapping 10 base pairs, advancing at one end, then the other unwraps to complete the turn. These findings provide insight into nucleosome construction, disruption, and repositioning, ongoing cellular processes.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the protein Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) protects cells from oxidative stress by preserving lysosomal integrity. Lysosomes are sensitive to oxidative damage due to their dependence on intracellular acidic pH and membrane gradients. Apo, an extracellular protein with antioxidant properties, is secreted by astrocytes to help neurons cope with stress. While its role is known at cellular and organismal levels, its mechanism was unknown. The study analyzed ApD intracellular traffic and its role in lysosomal homeostasis upon paraquat-induced stress. Single-lysosome pH measurements and immunodetection showed Apo is endocyted and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. Apo is stable in acidic environment and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalin in astrocytes and neurons by preventing membrane permeabilization. Two lysosomal processes, myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and neurodegeneration autagy in Drosila model, require Apo-related Lipins. Results reveal a new function of Apo, a conserved gene family member, regulating lysosomal membrane integrity as a mechanism for cellular functions in neurodegenerative diseases. This opens therapeutic opportunities for lysosomal repair in pathological situations.
Researchers studied the biology and susceptibility of Phlebotus orientalis sandflies from two geographically distant localities in Ethiopia to Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis. Two colonies of P. orientalis were obtained from a non-endemic site in the lowlands of Melka Wer and an endemic focus of human VL in the highlands Addis Zemen. Marked differences in life cycle parameters were observed between the two colonies, including distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analyses using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAP) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI genes did not reveal any genetic differences between the two colonies. F1 hybrids developed higher fecundity than the parental colonies. Susceptibility of P. orient to L. donani was studied by experimental infections. Even the lowest infective dose (2x10^3 per ml) was sufficient for successful establishment of L. donani infections in about 50% of P. orient females. Using higher infective doses, infection rates were around 90% for both colonies. Leish development in P. orient was fast, with presence of metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and colonization of the stomal valve by homonads recorded in P. orient females by five days post-feeding. Both MW and AZ of P. orient were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donani strains. The average of blood-meals by P. orient females was about 0.7 µl, the infective at lowest dose was one or two L. donastigotes per sand-meal. Development of L. don was similar in P orient colonies, hence the absence of visceral leishiasis in non-endemic Mel Wer cannot attributed to susceptibility local P orient populations to L donani.
Researchers conducted a study to quantify the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica in a schistosoma japon-haemic county in the People's Republic of China. They used a patient-based evaluation, the EQ-5D questionnaire, to assess health-related quality of life and disability. Of 506 candidates, 215 cases were confirmed with advanced schosmias japonica. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort (90.7%), usual activities (87.9%), and anxiety or depression (80.9%). The overall disability weight (DW) was 0.447, and age-specific DW ranged from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 to 0.510 among the elderly ≥60. DW was associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and albumin were protective for quality of life. These patient-preference estimates could update the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study and inform evidence-based decision-making for China's schosmiasis control program.
African Trypanosomias, also known as sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals, are prevalent parasitic vector-borne diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. Humans acquire trypanosomias through the bite of a tse flies infected with protozoa Trypanosoma brucei, specifically T. b. gambense in West and Central Africa and T. rhodesense in East and Southern Africa. A retrospective study used national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's tse belts, assessing the potential for H-acquired infection in those areas. A multilevel design estimated likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, within tse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty and recent migrants of working age were studied. Tse impact on disability was conceptualized via two pathways: direct from bite of pathogenic tse resulting in H infection or indirect, as potential A takes out agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to morbidity and mortality, contributing to nutritional and poverty. T belts associated with increased prevalence were identified and direct indirect pathways evaluated. Incorporating reports from census is a promising tool for future H surveillance in sub-Saharan. Combined burdens H and A and costs production in A areas are contributors to within tse-infested.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells, but its mechanism of action is poorly defined. This study demonstrates that HM activates the PI3/Akt pathway, leading to phosphorylation of HEXIM and release of active transcription elongation factor (PTEF) from its inactive complex with HEXIM and 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). As a result, PF is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription and production. Despite continuous HM presence, released PF rapidly reassembles with 7snRNA and HEXIM. A mutant HEX1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released PF and sn via PI/Akt antagonizes HM-mediated induction of viral production. Inhibition of PI/Akt and expression of mutant HEX1 that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt also antagonize HM-mediated induction of viral production. HM targets cellular factor PF for reactivation of HIV. A mechanism releasing PF from HEXIM and sn has not been determined. HM activates viral production in chronically infected cells via transient release of active PF from HEXIM. This depends on transient activation of PI/Akt that leads to phosphorylation of T and S in HEX. Released PF is recruited to HIV promoter to stimulate transcription. Inhibition of PIkt in chronically cells or expression of mutant HEX that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt antagonizes HM induction of transcription by HM. Studies reveal how HM releases PF to reactivate production from latency. HM disrupts in PIkt manner to release PF that is recruited to HIV promoter and sequences. Consequently, RNA elongates on viral genome.
Researchers have identified a link between the Leishmania virus (LRV) and the development of mucosal (ML) and disseminated cutaneous leishmanias (DCL) in patients infected with New World Leishmania (Viann) species. LRV is associated with elevated parasitemia, hyperinflammation, and disease exacerbation. Studies on LRV in other Leish strains and species require improved detection methods, independent of viral sequence knowledge, as LRV shows significant divergence. This study presents techniques for LRV detection, including an anti-dRNA monoclonal antibody J, which recognizes dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner. Applications include immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot, complementing nucleic acid purification and real-time PCR. Methods were evaluated and demonstrated LRV detection in several strains, patient samples, and infected mice biopsies. LRV is recognized by TLR3, exacerbating disease in a dose-dependent manner in murine models. Leish has a digetic life cycle, with promastigote in sand fly midgut and amigote in mammalian macrophage. LRV was tested on isolated Leish parasites from an L brazensis patient, typed as L brazensis by PCR. The approach was applied on catalogued isolates, fresh L braz sample, and murine biops, showing ease of use for field application. The technique has potential for predicting LRV-related leish dissemination risk.
Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (EPEC and EHE) are closely related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. PEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHE relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspF. The ability to generate these structures correlates with colonization in animal models, but the function of pedest in infection is unclear. This study characterized colonization of PEC and ECE during polarized epithelial cells. Both formed distinct bacterial communities or "macroies" that encompassed multiple cells. Tir and Esp, as well as the Arp2/3 complex, were critical for expansion of macroies over time. Unexpectedly, EspF accelerated formation of larger macroies compared to PEC, as Esp-mediated actin assembly drove bacterial motility to junctions, where bacteria formed a pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one daughter to disengage and infect the second. These data reveal Esp enhances epithelial colonization by actin-based motility and efficient cell-to-cell transmission.
A study compared the effectiveness of two methods for isolating extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the excretory-secretory products of the helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica: differential centrifugation (DC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Currently, DC is the most widely used method for EV isolation in helth research, but SEC has been used for other pathogens. The study found that SEC-purified EVs were smaller and less diverse than DC-purified EVs by transmission and atomic force microscopy. Protein quantification and Western blotting showed SEC resulted in higher purity of EV to excretory-secretory protein (ESP) yield compared to DC, with reduced soluble cathepsin proteases in SEC EVs. Proteomic analysis revealed DC contamination from ESP in EVs with increased protein identifications and peptide hits compared to SEC EVs. SEC-pur EVs contained less tegument proteins than DC-pur EVs. The study suggests DC and SEC methods do not isolate equivalent EV populations and caution should be taken in choosing EV purification methods, with DC protocols including free proteins and tegument artefacts. SEC is proposed for EV purification prior to downstream studies.
Researchers employed a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in Drosila melanogaster, focusing on the expression of gap genes Krpp, kni, and gt. They used detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression to fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation and establish its structural and practical identifiability. The results showed that post-transcription regulation is not required for patterning in this system but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. The study demonstrates the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal formation, increasing the potential of reverse engineering for study of development and other complex biological processes.

The researchers used a reverse-engineering approach to gain quantitative insights into postcription regulation by fitting the model to data in a rigorous and reproducible manner. They first determined if the model was formulated to have a unique solution, then fitted it to protein data using mRNA patterns as inputs or boundary conditions. If models reproduced protein patterns, they concluded postcription was not required for expression. If models failed, they identified features relying on postcription processes.

The approach was applied to the complex problem of spatio-temporal formation in Drosila melanaster embryo, addressing the importance of postcription in development. A high-resolution dataset of mRNA expression for Kr, kn, and gt was created covering the blastoderm stage.
Researchers investigated the age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial immune response to rotavirus infection in a mouse model. They found that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 or the adaptor molecule TRIF exhibited higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial pro-inflammatory and antiviral gene expression compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in TLR or TRIF did not display impaired stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, a major contribution of non-hematietic cell in TR-mediated antiral response was detected in adult animals. A significant age-dependent increase of TLR expression was also detected in human intestinal biops. The study suggests that upregulation of epithelial TLR expression during infancy contributes to age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus.
Researchers conducted whole-exome sequencing (WES) on 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 870 controls from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIH) repository with similar ancestry to the cases. Two sequencing centers used different methods to produce and call variants from the data. The goal was to ensure the distribution of rare variation was similar across data from both centers. This was achieved by filtering variants by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative reads. Results were evaluated using seven samples sequenced at both centers and results from the study. Next, they addressed how to combine data and results from centers. Gene-based analysis was an obvious, but should statistics for association be combined across centers (meta-analysis) or data combined and analyzed (mega)? Due to the nature of gene-based tests, mega-analysis had better power than meta-analysis. Before analyzing data for association, they explored the impact of population on rare variant in data. Like recent studies, they found population structure confounded case-control studies by clustering rare variants in ancestry; however, unlike recent studies, they found principal-based analyses sufficient to control ancestry and produce statistics with distributions. Using gene-based tests and meta and mega-analysis, they found no new genes for ASD in sample. Results suggest gene tests require larger samples and controls before effective for discovery, even for disorder ASD.
Researchers conducted a retrospective study to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the chitriosase and AMCase genes and the incidence of mycetoma caused by Madlla myetatis in a Sudanese population. The study included 112 myetoma patients and 103 controls and genotyped for four polymorphisms: a 24-b insertion in the chitrios gene (rs1317), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in AMCase (617), SNP (41292), and 10-b insertion in the 5'UT region of AMCase (143088). DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes determined using PCR-FL. Histological staining confirmed the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The study found that polymorphism in chitrios resulting in decreased activity was associated with increased odds of myet (odds ratio 2.9, p=0.004). No association was found for polymorphisms in genes AMCase (p>0.05). Decreased chitrios activity was associated with increased risk of M myet myetoma.
Researchers have challenged the traditional understanding of herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency by showing that lytic genes can be transcribed during this state. Using a sensitive Cre-reporter model, they found that lytic and latent phases are not as clearly defined as previously thought. Half of HSV spread to latent sites occurred after initial infection, and direct evidence shows lytic promoters drive protein expression during latency. This is the most direct evidence to date that HSV-1 lytic promoters can generate protein during latency. Further, using promoters associated with immune recognition, they linked CD8+ T cell activation in latently infected DRG with viral expression during latency. This is consistent with either limited lytic gene expression being integral to latency or early presentation of proteins to CD8 cells halting reactivation by immune mechanism. To explore adaptive immunity and viral expression, they examined a virus driven by ICP47 promoter, showing some virus spreads with lytic expression after first week of infection, but not during latency. This matches results for I0 promoter, which does not lead to protein during latency. Cre-report models have not revealed ly expression during latency, contrary to immunological studies. However, no promoter drives anti-HSV CD8 cells has been tested. HSV-1 latency is defined as viral DNA persistence without infectious virus. Mouse models show profound latency, reactivation difficult in vivo. Historically, transcription was restricted to latency associated transcripts (LAT).
Misfolding and aggregation of proteins are key features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases. In these diseases, misfolded proteins accumulate through a mechanism involving polymerization. Prion diseases involve host protein misfolding to a pathogenic, protease-resistant form PrP, which accumulates in neurons, astroglia, and microglia in the CNS. A study using dual-staining immunohistochemistry compared cell specificity of PrP accumulation at preclinical times post-infection in three scrapie strains differing in brain pathology. Pr from each strain had different cell specificity. Strain 22 was associated with astroglia, whereas strain ME with neurons and neuropil in thalamus and cortex, strain R was similar to 22 but in substantia nigra was similar ME. Expression of 90 genes in neuroinflammation was studied quantitatively from thalam at pre times. Surprisingly, despite differences in Pr accumulation, pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all strains, and differences correlated with variations in disease tempo. Gene upregulation correlated with activation of astroia and microgl detected early prior vacolar or clinical signs. Profile of upregulated in scrapie differed from two viral CNS diseases Larosse and polytropic retroirus with reactive gli levels to pr-infected mice.
Researchers have developed an efficient coarse-grained model to study the 3D organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for gene regulation and cell function. Chromosomes are long, densely packed, and topologically constrained polymers, making it challenging to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate their multi-spatio-temporal scales. The proposed strategy accounts for polymer entanglement and volumic density, capturing steady-state and dynamical properties, and dynamics at different coarse-graining scales, offering a power-law gain in efficiency and a systematic way to define coarse-grained models. This approach was applied to investigate the evolution of chromosome 3R (20Mbp) in Drosophila during a cell cycle (20h), combining coarse-graining with a one-parameter copolymer model integrating epigen-driven interactions, reproducing experimental data and predicting chromatin is dynamic during the cycle.

The model achieved high numerical efficiency by introducing rigidity and controlling volume fraction, simulating chromosome dynamics during a cycle on a desktop within a day. A coarse-grained model for chromatin was built with a copoly framework based on epigen data, investigating folding and dynamics of a 20Mbp chromosome, the first to describe large regions during a cycle with high precision. The strategy is generic and can be applied to self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems, neglecting topological constraints may lead to erroneous fine-scale description, and supplementary interactions may misinterpret observations.
Researchers conducted an integrative analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and cis-regulatory elements to understand the mechanisms underlying cell specificity of QTL. They analyzed eQ data from 11 studies on 7 cell types, integrated with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project, and built classifiers to predict cell specificity of QTL. The study found that QTL associated with hundreds of cell-specific CRE, including enhancers, promoters, repressive chromatin regions, open chromatin, and DNA binding proteins, providing insight into molecular mechanisms generating cell specificity QTL and regulation. Using a random forest classifier with CRE-SNP overlap features, they demonstrated predicting cell specificity QTL feasibility. They also showed that CRE from trait-associated cell can annotate GW associations without eQ data for that cell. This integrative predictive modeling improves understanding of complex phenotypic variation mechanisms. The study highlights the relationship between Q SNP-CRE overlap and cell specificity Q replication, building classifiers to predict Q in absence of gene data, and function of GW SNPs with phenotypes lacking Q data. GW associations are enriched in DNase hypersensitive sites and QSNPs, and follow-up studies mechanistically tied disease SNPs to misregulation. eQs are used to provide mechanistic interpretations for human associations, but cell specificity Q presents a problem. Q SNPs overlapping type CRE are enriched for type Q, suggesting specific mechanisms. The relationship between Q reproducibility and CRE led to hypothesis SNP-CRE predicting Q in absence data.
Researchers have developed a new cell line of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that limits glycosylation to mannose (Man) and earlier intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. This was achieved by inactivating the gene encoding Mannosyl Alpha-1,3-Glycoprotein Beta-1,2-Acetylglucosyltransferase (MG1) enzyme. Monomeric gp120 produced in this cell line exhibits improved binding to glycan-dependent monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed to the V1/V domain (e.g., PG9) and V3 (e.g., PGT and 10-107) while preserving glycan-independent epitopes (e.g., V01). The ability of this cell line to limit glycosylation to early intermediates without impairing growth or doubling time suggests it will be useful for biopharm production of HIV-1 immunogens. A major goal in HIV research is to develop immunogens eliciting broad neutralizing Abs (NAbs). The discovery of mAbs recognizing glycan epitopes has altered thinking on how to produce vaccines. Instead of using standard CHO cell lines incorporating complex glycosylation, a line limiting glycos to high-mann forms may be useful for gp immunogens.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphatase (T6) from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi as a potential target for anthelmint drugs. T6 is essential for nemode survival due to toxic effects of trehal 6-phosphate accumulation and is also present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The X-ray crystal structure of T from B. malayi revealed a stabilizing N-terminal domain and catalytic C-terminal C2-type H phosphat fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses with competitive inhibitor trehal 6-sulf identified key residues for binding and catalysis. A model of the T6-trehal 6-phosphate complex indicates substrate binding driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions, differing from sucrose-6-phosphatase which relies on hydrogen bonds. This suggests high-affinity inhibitors will bind to the phosphoryl pocket and non-native to trehal pocket. Conservation of key residues in T enzymes from parasitic nemodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests a common strategy for T6 inhibitor design, applicable to antibiotics and anthelmics. The trehal site is dominated by hydrophobic residues, unlike other carbohydrate binding proteins. A model of T with trehal 6-phosphate in the active site was constructed for inhibitor design. T is required for trehal synthesis and present in bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, but not mammals. Importantly, RNA knockdown of the tps-1 gene causes lethality due to trehal 6-phosphate accumulation, suggesting a T inhibitor could have the same effect.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to simulate blood and interstitial fluid transport in whole tumors, taking into account their spatially heterogeneous vascular architectures. This is crucial for optimizing anti-cancer therapies, as disorganized leaky blood vessels contribute to suboptimal treatment efficacy. The model combines Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, incorporating blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to accurately predict tumor fluid dynamics. It enables controlled experiments to investigate how tumor vascular heterogeneity affects fluid transport. The framework was applied to an orthopic murine glioma and human colorectal carcinoma, and sensitivity analysis revealed key mechanisms determining fluid transport. Modifying vascular and interstitial parameters showed that realistic vasculature is key to contrasting fluid response between tumors. Contrary to literature, reducing tumor interstitial pressure does not increase perfusion, and therapies should target interstitial pressure gradient. Stabilizing vessel diameters and permeabilities may alter hydraulic conductivity, suggesting normalizing interstitial environment may increase perfusion.
Researchers investigated the role of cell-to-cell transmission in HIV-1 infection and its susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors. They developed experimental strategies to distinguish between cell-free and cell transmission and found that neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and entry inhibitors have varying activity depending on their mode of action. gp41-directed agents remained active, while CD4-binding site (CDbs) inhibitors, including potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, lost potency during cell transmission. This suggests CDbs mAbs preferentially block free transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell contacts. This explains how HIV maintains infectivity and evades potent, broadly active CDbs antibody responses in vivo. The study provides evidence that neutralizing antibodies differ in blocking free and cell transmission based on their mode of action. HIV relies on both modes to maintain infection in vivo, implying that entry and neutralizing efficacy against cell transmission should be considered. A panel of neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors were tested for potency against free and cell-associated virus. The study aimed to dissect efficacy of neutral and entry in cell transmission. Neutral antibodies recognize epitopes on envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41 accessible in oligomeric form. HIV spreads efficiently through various cell contacts, but no clear picture of antibody action emerged.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain how attention affects neural responses and receptive fields in the visual system. The model suggests that top-down modulation from higher areas, such as V4 or MT, can produce the observed effects on neural responses, rather than input areas like V1. The model requires feedback connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area, redistributing modulation to lower areas and altering inputs of higher cells, including those not initially modulated. This produces firing rate modulations and receptive shifts. Simultaneously, short-range inhibition between cells produce competitive effects scaling receptive field size. The model reproduces attentional effects on rates (response gain, input, gain, competition scaled receptive size) and receptive structure (shifts, resizing spatial and feature space) without modifying parameters. It also predicts attention response curves shift from gain to contrast as focus drifts away from cell. 

The model requires modulatory connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area, redistributing top-down modulation to lower areas, altering inputs of higher cells. This produces attention effects on responses, receptive expansion towards focus. The model suggests effects arise from feedback between higher and lower areas, interacting with short inhibition between cells. Attention source is plain modulation of top layer, intermediate cortex, V4 and MT, unlike existing models positing input modulation.
In Drosophila, a group of specialized cells called the posterior signalling centre (P) controls blood cell homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. This role is similar to the microenvironment of hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates. The P acts non-autonomously to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators (J/STAT) signalling in hematietic progenitors (proocytes), preserving their multipotent character for differentiation into lamlocytes, a cell type required to fight specific threats such as wasp parasism. A study using knock-out by homolog recombination shows that a type I cytokine receptor CG142/Lat is required to switch off J/STAT signalling in proocytes, a prerequisite for lamlocyte differentiation upon wasp. In vivo and cell assays indicate Lat forms heteromers with Dome, a Doph type cytokine receptor related to mammalian GP130, and antagonizes Dome activity dose-dependently. Analysis shows primary response to wasp is a decrease in cytok mRNA in lymph, followed by increase in Lat/Dome ratio. This sequence culminates in complete inhibition of J/STAT by Lat. J/STAT is associated with human diseases including leukaemia, while knock studies point to central role in hematies and immune regulation. Doph Lat function is first in vivo example of nonsignalling controlling dedicated response, raising question whether nonsign also control vertebrate cellular.
Researchers investigated recombination patterns in geminiviruses, a family of single-stranded DNA viruses, during co-infections of tomato plants with Tomato yellow curl virus (TY) and Tomato leaf curl virus (TO). They found that recombination patterns are complex and influenced by local sequence similarity, not secondary structure, and that selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-genomic interactions, such as protein-protein and nucleic acid folding, is strong. The study analyzed 120 days of experimental infections and observed recombinants with up to 58 breakpoints, exceeding previous reports of 18 breakpoints in maize virus recombination. Local sequence similarity, not secondary structure, influences recombination breakpoints. Selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-gen interactions, such as protein-protein and nucleic acid folding, influences overall recombination patterns. The study found that preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and DNA interactions is strong enough to identify exact sequence tracts involved in these interactions. Geminiviruses are ideal subjects due to emergence of crop pathogens attributed to inter-species recombination and well-characterized intra-protein, interprotein, and protein-DNA interactions.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between nucleosomes, the basic units of eukotic chromatin, and the evolution of eotic genomes. Contrary to the idea that nucleosomes are unique to eukotes, histone proteins have been found in archaeal genomes. However, archaeal nucleosomes differ from eukotic counterparts in several ways, including assembly into tetramers rather than octamers and lack of N- and C-terminal tails. Despite these differences, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence is conserved between humans and the archaeon Halofer volcanii. The study examined whether mutation or selection could explain concord substitution patterns in the two kingdoms, but found neither model sufficient to explain the association. Instead, nucleosome substitution patterns are consistent with a model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. Nucleosome reposition is shown to be necessary and sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased patterns. This highlights the importance of considering causality between genetic and epigenetic change. 

The study compared substitution patterns around nucle footprints in humans to dynamics in Halofera, a group of halophilic archaea, including Halofer volcanii, which nucleosome organization was determined at high resolution. Nucleosomes in both eukotes and archaea share a preference for GC-rich sequence, suggesting similar reposition behavior when sequence changes. However, archaeal nucleosomes differ from euk counterparts in assembly, forming tetramers rather than octamers and wrapping less DNA. The study found dy-oriented trends in sister lineages, inconsistent with mutation or purifying selection on static nucleosomes over time. Instead, patterns are consistent with local reposition of nucleosomes in response to substitutions.
Researchers have developed a novel method to identify key positions in proteins that are crucial for maintaining conformational diversity, which is essential for protein function. Conformation diversity allows proteins to bind to different ligands with varying affinities, and intramolecular vibrations facilitate transitions between conformations. A coarse-grained normal mode analysis was used to explore these features. The method was applied to 188 paired protein structures in bound and unbound forms. Normal modes involved in conformation change were selected based on overlap with ligand-induced distortions. The subspace defined by these modes was used to analyze the effect of point mutations on conformation diversity. A negative correlation was found between mutation effects on normal subspaces and evolutionary conservation. Positions altering these subspaces were identified as key, mostly buried aliphatic residues in regular regions like β-sheets and α-helixes.
Researchers investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M) metabolism, a key enzyme involved in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. They engineered an M strain with reduced FBA levels and found that depletion of F resulted in clearance of M in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, consistent with M's ability to coatabolize multiple sources, viability could be restored when cultured on mixtures of glycol and gluogenic carbon sources. In vitro studies revealed that lack of F could only be compensated by specific balance of glucose and butyrate, with growth and metabolism of butrate determined by M's ability to coatabize glucose. These findings evaluate F as a potential target in both replicating and persistent M, and expand understanding of multiplicity in vitro that define essentiality of M's F in vivo.
Researchers investigated the role of mitochondrial 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (mTXx) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that lacks catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases. They found that TXx null mutants (mtxn-) were unable to thrive in a murine infection model, but this was not due to a lack of peroxidase activity, as they behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants. TXx mutants were also avirulent in hosts unable to mount an oxidative phagocyte response. A perase-inactive version of TXx rescued the non-infect phenotype of txn, suggesting a novel function as a molecular chaperone. TXx suppressed thermal aggregation of citrate synth in vitro and txn mutants were sensitive to temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C, reminiscent of organisms lacking chone genes. These findings change the paradigm of trypanoid 2-cys peroxins as peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrate that 2-c peroxins can be determinant for pathogenic independently of perase activity.
Researchers conducted a multicenter, prospective diagnostic study to evaluate the accuracy of the Histoplas urine antigen (HAg) test, also known as ALPHA-HAg, for diagnosing disseminated histoplasis (PDH) in HIV-infected patients. The study included 288 patients with suspected PDH and compared the results of the ALPHA-HAg test to the reference standard histoplas capsul growth on blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or histopath exam. The study found a sensitivity of 67.1% (95% CI, 56.8-76.8) and specificity of 97.5 (95% CI, 94.3-99.1) for the ALPHA-HAg test. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2 (95 CI 11.6-74.4). In 10.5% of PD-proven patients, co-infections were diagnosed, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium complex. The study suggests that the ALPHAAg test may be useful for starting antifungal treatment, but a culture-based approach is necessary due to frequent co-infections and a negative result does not rule out PD. A previous study in Brazil reported 100% sensitivity and 92.9 specificity for ALPHAAg in 78 proven PD cases, while another reported 22.7 sensitivity and 30 specificity in a subset of patients with culture-proven or histopath cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a urinary assay with 84 sensitivity and 94 specificity in 106 culture-proven histlasis patients. The results are difficult to compare due to study design, but multicenter comparisons against cultures and histology are lacking. The study found 66 patients with other infections and AIDS-defining malignancies, nine co-infecting or coexisting with PD.
Researchers conducted a metagenomic analysis of viral communities in stool specimens from 12 children with diarrhea to identify the spectrum of viruses, including novel viruses, present during acute episodes. They employed a "microassay" sequencing method requiring minimal sample quantity (<100mg), minimal purification, and limited sequencing (384 reads/sample). This approach detected known enteric viruses and sequences from putatively novel viruses with limited similarity to GenBank. 

The study aimed to explore viral diversity in pediatric patients with diarrhea, anticipating variation between specimens and desirability to sample multiple patients for overall perspective on diversity. Metagenomics enabled systematic, unbiased exploration of known and novel viruses in stool, laying groundwork for assessing novel viruses' causal role in diarrhea. Microass sequencing defined viral communities in fecal samples from diarrhea patients, detecting known and novel viruses from few colonies per sample. These studies serve as springboard for interrogating diverse viruses' roles in gastrointestinal tract. 

This is the first metagen investigation of viral diversity in human diarrhea, whereas previous studies analyzed 4 specimens from 3 healthy individuals. Pediatric stool provides smaller volumes, so strategy minimized purification steps to analyze 30mg fecal matter. Micro sequencing generated data from 12 patients with acute diarrhea.
A study in the Dominican Republic compared the transmission dynamics of Zika and deng viruses using national surveillance data. The study found that 75% of deng cases occurred in individuals under 20 years old, while Zika infections were more dispersed among the population. Dengue rates were higher among males (25.9 per 10,000 population) compared to females (21.5 per 10,000). In contrast, Zika infections were highly clustered among females (73.8%, 95% CI 72.6, 75.0; p<0.05), with age-adjusted rates of 7.64 per 10,000 in females compared to 2.72 per 10,000 in males. Stratification by sex showed higher rates among females (1.84, 1.82,1.87; p<0.05) compared to males (1.72,1.69,1.75; p<0.05). However, GBS rates stratified by sex showed higher risk in males (0.62,0.57 per 10,000). The study suggests little impact of existing deng immunity on Zika attack rates at the population level. Confounding R and incident calculations by sex-specific reporting may alter reliability of epidemiological metrics, which can be addressed using proxy syndromes or conditions to explore sex-skewed incidence. The findings indicate community campaigns, influencing short-term health behavior, remain plausible behind increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. Media and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on Zika outcomes among deng seropositive individuals.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 2 (PAR2) is the predominant enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ri)ylation in response to DNA damage and immune responses, contrary to humans where poly(ADP-ri) polymerase 1 (PAR1) accounts for over 90% of cellular activity. PAR2 has a SAP binding motif, not a zinc finger domain, and makes stronger contributions to immune responses against Pseudomonas syringae and reduction of DNA double-strand breaks. Poly(ADP-ri)glycohydrolase (PARG) enzymes show Arabidopsis P1 and not P2 as major contributors to poly(AD-ri) removal from proteins. PAR2 activity is influenced by PAR1 and P1. PAR2 and PAR physically interact with P1 and P2, suggesting regulatory interactions among mediators of poly(AD-ri)ylation. PAR2 and P proteins are structurally distinct from animal counterparts, indicating substantial differences in regulation. PAR2 rather than PAR1 plays major role in Arabid DNA damage and immune responses. P1 rather than P2 counteracts poly(AD-ri) in Arabid. PAR1 associates with PAR2, and PAR1 and PAR interact with P and P2. Arabid TNA lines with PAR1 and PAR2 mutations show sensitivity to genotoxic agents. PAR1 and PAR double mutants show reduced poly(AD-ri activity.
Researchers have identified a new signaling pathway that regulates synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm. This pathway, called the M-15/JNK-1 MAP kinase cascade, opposes the RPM-1 signaling pathway, which is involved in synapse formation and axon termination. RPM-1 acts as an ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the DL-1 and ML-1 MAP kinase pathways. The M-15/J-1 pathway includes kinases M-15, NS-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, which suppress synapse defects but not axon termination in rpm-1 mutants. Transgenic overexpression of these kinases in the M-15/J-1 pathway impairs synapse in wild-type animals. The M-15/J-1 functions autonomously in mechanensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, indicating a role in synapse development. Loss of M-15/J-1 signaling also suppresses habituation to repeated stimuli in rpm mutants, a behavioral deficit likely due to impaired glutamatergic synapse formation.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary changes in the bipotential switch that controls the sperm/oocyte decision in hermaphroditic nematodes, specifically in Caenorhabditis brigae and Caenorhabditis elegans. They confirmed that the sex-determination protein TR-1 (TRA-1) is bipotential, meaning it can activate or repress the same target genes in response to changing signals from upstream genes. They identified a co-factor required for TRA-1 and explored how the structure of the bipot switch changes during evolution. Null mutants revealed that Caenorhabditis brigae TR-1 is required for spermatogenesis and RNA interference implies it works as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetylase complex. RT-PCR data showed it promotes the expression of C-fog-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. Epistasis tests showed TR-1 works through TR-1 to activate Cog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision. Previous studies showed TR-1 represses Cog-3, demonstrating it is bipot. TR- also regulates the development of the male tail. Caenorhabditis brigae tr-1 mutants prevent heraphroditic spermatogenesis, but Caenorhabdis fem mutants disrupt the other half of the switch. Caenorhabis elegans null mutants prevent spermatogenesis, but Caenoridis tr-1 mutants do not. Synthetic interactions confirm both halves of the switch exist in each species. The relationship between the halves of the bipot switch can shift during evolution, producing the same phenotype by alternative mechanisms.
Researchers have developed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the integrated information generated by a system as it transitions between states, which can reflect levels of consciousness in neural systems. These measures can be applied to time-series data, overcoming the limitations of previous measure ΦDM, which is only defined for discrete Markov systems and rare in biology. Simulations demonstrate the practical applicability of the new measures and explore their properties. The results provide opportunities to examine integration in real and model systems and implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and neurocognitive processes. However, findings pose challenges for theories ascribing physical meaning to measured quantities. 

Integrated information is a measure of how much a system generates more than the sum of its parts, reflecting consciousness in neural systems. Previous measures, such as Φ, were formulated in the context of Integrated Theory of Consciousness (IT), which considers consciousness as a fundamental property. The new measures, ΦE and Φ, are framed in terms of process, easy to apply in practice, permitting testable hypotheses and synthetic models examining integrated in neuroognitive processes. The ITC ascribes physical meaning to integrated information, considering consciousness as a capacity, not process. The new measures can be applied to time-series data from neuroimaging and biological datasets to test consciousness and neuroognitive processes, investigate how integrated is modulated by input and output, and environment, and determine theoretical implications.
Researchers used Bayesian geostatistical analysis to investigate the spread of Rhodesian African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda, focusing on environmental and climatic factors that control its distribution. A previous study used logistic regression to explore the relationship between H prevalence and social, environmental, and climatic variables in two affected districts, suggesting disease spread due to infected livestock movement. This study extends the analysis to account for spatial autocorrelation, uncertainty in data and model parameters, and predictive mapping of future H prevalence. A Bayesian geostat model was used to account for autocorrelation and uncertainty, resulting in more accurate parameter estimates and increased predictive accuracy. The study supports the hypothesis that H was introduced via untreated infected livestock movement, and confirms health care accessibility and land temperature effects. Predictive mapping shows increased risk in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of trading in disease spread. Adhering to treat livestock policy at sale is crucial to prevent spread.
Researchers have challenged the long-held assumption that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems, particularly in the 1970s, and more recently in ecologically-inspired networks. They assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium with positive abundances, but this assumption has not been tested. Analytical results and simulations show that feasibility vanishes in species-rich systems, leaving the existence of a feasible equilibrium in stability criteria far from granted. The study extends by changing interaction structure and intensity, finding that feasibility and stability are warranted regardless of species richness with weak interactions. The dynamics of ecologically-inspired architectures differ from unstructured systems. Results suggest a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires the interplay between interaction strength, network structure, and how strengths are distributed in architecture. Feasibility is critical to study in systems. May's paradox that complexity decreases stability in models led to exploration of topological effects on dynamics. Several works show particular architectures stabilize ecological networks, but feasibility of different architectures for interaction regimes is unexplored. Feas can be easily evaluated. Results indicate information on dynamics will be obtained by concentrating on interplay between structure, strengths, and how are distributed in architecture.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to assess the seroprevalence of Coxiella burnii, the causative agent of Q fever, in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 204 humans and 955 cattle in 416 households were analyzed for C. burnii antibodies, and questionnaires covering demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information were administered. Data were linked to environmental datasets based on geographical locations, such as land cover. Correlation and spatial correlation analyses were applied to assess the link between cattle and human seropreval. Multilevel regression was used to assess relationships between socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors and seropositivity in both humans and animals. The overall seroprevalence of C burnii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5 in cattle, but no correlation was found between cattle and human seropval either within households or incorporating spatial proximity to households. Multile modelling indicated factors for exposure to organism cattle from market as opposed to bred in household and residing areas with lower precipitation had highest seropreval. For humans, the youngest group had highest odds of serositivity, variations observed between ethnic groups, and frequent contact with livestock, specifically grazing and dealing with material was a factor. Results illustrate endemicity of C burnii in western Kenya, although prevalence relatively low. Analysis indicates environmental factors play role in cattle exposure, human patterns likely driven by livestock. Implication of markets in cattle exposure suggests suitable for interventions.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni and identified 33 DEAD-box RNA helicases, a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in RNA processing and regulation. Three of these helicases, Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3, were found to be similar to the Vasa protein, a marker of primordial germ cells in metazoans. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 are members of the Vasa/10 DEAD-box subfamily. Transcripts of Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 were cloned from cDNAs of mixed adult worms and quantitative PCR revealed their presence in developmental stages of S. mansoni with elevated expression in sporocysts, adult, females, eggs, and miracidia, with high expression in undeveloped egg. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) analysis showed Sm1, Sm, and Sm were transcribed in the ovary where oocytes. Germ specific expression of schosome vasa genes provide a landmark for germ line genesis of schosomes, eti agents of major tropical diseases.

Among the 33 DEAD helicases of S. mans, BLAST revealed three deduced schosome enzymes Sm, Sm, Sm, and Sm showed high identity to Vasa from other flukes Sm was 89% identical and 95 similar to DDX-dependent RNA helase of blood fluke S. A route to germ line schosome is to transduce egg and genetic manipulation this stage is feasible. Germ genesis might be more monitored if schosome cells could be localized and tracked in forms this path. Vasa an ATP-dependent DEAD RNAic is archetypal metazo germ marker. Following reports of these roles vasa in species, DEAD RNAic have been essential for schosome survival and potential vasa products targets in schosome worthy consideration.
A study investigated the role of VGL4, a transcriptional coactivator in the Hippo signaling pathway, in cardiac valve development and homeostasis. Hipp signaling is crucial for organ development and tissue homeostasis, but its role in valve formation and maintenance was unknown. VGL4 was found to be expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-embryonic stage and maintained through adulthood. Tissue-specific knockout of V4 in different cell lineages revealed that loss of V4 in endothelial lineage led to valve malformation with expanded expression of YAP targets. Further, semi-knock of Y in V4-ablated hearts constrained hyperproliferation of valve interstitial cells. These findings suggest V4 is important for valve development and manipulation of Hipp components may be a therapy for preventing congenital valve disease. Loss of V in endothelial cells resulted in abnormal valves and cardiac hypertrophy in 36-week-old mice, while semi-knock of Y rescued malformation induced by V deletion. The study shows V4 and Hipp signaling are required for proper valve remodeling and maturation. Hipp signaling in endothelial cells is necessary for post-embonic valve morphogenesis and homeostasis. Precise regulation of the pathway is required for proliferation endocardium-derived mesenchymal cells and valve elongation. The study identifies a previously unknown function of V4 in remodeling homeasis. Findings suggest mutations in V may underlie human congenital valve dysplasia.
Recent studies have suggested that soft sweeps, a type of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation, are pervasive across various organisms, including humans, Drosophila, and HIV. However, others have questioned the relevance of these models to natural populations and their identifiability to other population-level processes, suggesting sweeps are likely rare. This study reconciles opposing results by evaluating three recent studies and their methodologies using population theory and simulation. The examples are prone to high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying sweeps under hard and neutral models. Demographic histories combined with hard sweeps serve as a more parsimonious explanation. The lack of model testing and statistical analysis led to inaccurate views of evolutionary processes and trajectories. Generalization resulted in misleading answers to population genetics questions, suggesting a dominant role for selection in shaping patterns of variation. The claim of soft sweeps in humans is based on excess intermediate haplotype frequency across the genome, relying on prior knowledge of fitness distribution and demographic history. Hard sweeps of weak mutations are classified as soft, while demographic models result in similar haplotype structures to sweeps, including bottlenecks, structured populations, and migration. Severe bottlenecks result in genomic patterns appearing hard. Given non-equilibrium history and rare beneficial mutations, sweeps are unlikely in all instances. Examples span different population parameters, including humans, Dophila, and HIV.
Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, the primary vector for deng fever, exhibit inhibited host-seeking behavior for three days following a blood meal due to a hemolymph-borneal factor, Peptide. The mechanism of this suppression and the receptor through which it signals are unknown. Peptide shows similarity to Neurope-F peptides (NPF) that signal through Neurope Y (PY)-Like Receptors (PY). Eight PYRs were identified in the Ae aegypt genome and screened in a cell-based assay for sensitivity to a panel of peptides. Four PYRs responded to one or more ligands, but NYR1 responded to Peptide as well as PF. Two PYR homologs in the disease vector Ix scularis were also sensitive to Peptide. Injection of synthetic Peptide and PF inhibited host-seeking in non-fed females, whereas buffer or inactive Pe[C10 had no effect. To determine if PY1 is necessary for host-seeking inhibition, zinc-fingerases generated five independent null strains and tested for abnormalities. Mutants displayed normal behavior in locomotion, egg, sugar, feeding, blood, and host-seeking, but not host-seeking after meal. This study identified four Ae aegi PYRs and PY1 as a candidate PF receptor sensitive to Peptide. However, PY1 alone is not required for host-seeking, suggesting other receptors, peptides, or both regulate this behavior.
A study was conducted to model the risk of schistosomiasis transmission in Akure Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria, using satellite-derived environmental data. Schistomiasis is a parasitic disease influenced by environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, land temperature, land use/cover, and rainfall. The study used multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Sa's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify areas with suitable conditions for schosomias transmission. Factors considered were temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/cover as controlling schosias incidence. These factors were reclassified and overlaid to identify areas vulnerable to schosias. Weighted analysis was done after each factor was given weight through AHP. The prevalence of schias in the area was determined by parasitological analysis of urine samples collected through random sampling. Results showed varying schias risk with 82% of the area falling under high and very high category. One community (Ole) had lowest schias risk while risk increased in four communities (ju, Igoba, It, Ogb, and Oese). Predictions by model correlated with field observations. High zones corresponded to endemic communities. Environmental factors can be used to identify and predict schias transmission as well as monitor disease in rural communities.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumoc) meningitis is a bacterial infection of the brain that causes significant morbidity and mortality, with 75% of patients surviving but half experiencing long-term disabilities. The disease is characterized by massive neuronal death, predominantly in the hippocampus. Pneumolysin (LY) is a pneumoccal pathogenic factor belonging to the cholesterol-dependent cytolin (CDC) group. This study demonstrates a pathogenic cascade linking LY with glutamate release and subsequent NMD-dependent dendritic and synaptic pathology in pneumoc meningitis. During meningitis, multiple factors contribute, including oxidative stress, brain ischemia, edema, immune-derived glutamate, bacterial products, and other toxins.

This study is the first to describe synaptic loss in neocortex in pneumoc mening autopsy cases and animal model, identifying LY as critical in this process. Cellular and molecular mechanisms of LY-induced dendritic and synaptic damage confirm its pore-forming capacity, glutamate release, and NMD receptor activation. LY induces glutamate from astrocytes in calcium-dependent manner, a major source of elevated glut in pneumoc meningitis and model. Long-term cognitive decline in survivors implies synaptic loss as reason for cognitive abnormalities, previously unproven. Long-term potentiation and depression correlate spine shrinkage with decreased numbers and impairment in neurological disorders. This study investigates neocortical synapses in pneumoc mening and LY's role in effects.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers, and developing new prevention methods such as vaccines and microbicides requires understanding of their life cycle. The HPV life cycle is linked to the state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus made in the terminally differentiating suprab compartment. It has been recognized that HPV first establishes infection in the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but the reason is unclear. This might be due to specificity of entry receptors, but this does not explain differentiation restriction of HPV, as many cells can be infected in monolayer culture. Chemical approaches reveal that cell progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. Using HPV16 particles with intact genome, synchronized keratinocytes as hosts, and viral gene expression as readout, cells must enter M phase for infection to take place. Late phase inhibitors have no effect, whereas G, S, G, and M phase inhibitors prevent infection. Cells need to pass prophase for successful transcription of encapsulated genes. This provides reason HPVs establish in basal compartment of stratified epithel, as only this contains cycling cells. These findings have implications for HPV control.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffi, which causes systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. Using high-throughput sequencing, they found 24 potential milRNA candidates, with 17 in mycelial and 7 yeast phases. Two genes, d-1 and d-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins, and q-2 encoding Argonaute protein, were identified in P. marffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed d-2 of P. marffei is closely related to homologs in other dimorphic pathogenic fungi, suggesting co-evolution. d-2 among thermal fungi. d-2 demonstrated higher mRNA levels in mycel than yeast phase. Northern analysis confirmed expression of two milRN, PMil-M1 and PMil-M2, only in mycel. Using d-1, d-2, dDKO and q-2 deletion mutants, biogenesis of milRN was dependent on d-2 but not d- or q-. mRNA levels of predicted targets PMil-M were upregulated in knockdown PMil-MKD, supporting regulatory function milRN. This is the first report of milRN in a thermal dim pathogenic fungus and differential expression in mycel and yeast.
Zika virus (ZIK) emerged in French Polynes in 2013 and spread through the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Several Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to ZIK transmission, including Aedes aegypt, the main vector in the region, and Aedespolensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector deng virus. This study analyzed the ability of these vectors to transmit ZIK at a regional scale by evaluating the competence of wild Ae.egi and Apolensis populations from Pacific for ZIK strain circulated during 2013-2017 outbreak. Field Aeegi (three populations) and Apolensis (two) from Pacific were collected. Female mosquitoes were exposed to ZIK (107 TCID/mL) isolated in 2014. At 6, 9, and 21 post-infection, mosquito bodies (thorax and abdomen), and heads were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination, and transmission rates, respectively. Results showed ZIK infection rates were heterogeneous between Aeeg populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and homogenous. For Apensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between populations. Transmission efficiency revealed low vector competence for ZIK of different Ae populations. Results indicated low ZIK transmission by Aeeg and Apensis tested from Pacific. This was unexpected, suggesting other factors, such as vector density, lifespan, or immunologically naive fraction of population, contributed to rapid spread of ZV in Pacific during 201-2017.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Targeted StructureSeq to study the structure of long non-coding RNA (lnc) Xist, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. Targeted StructureSeq combines chemical probing of RNA in cells with massively parallel sequencing, enriching for signals from the RNA of interest to achieve high coverage with few reads, providing a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. This method was used to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA, developing new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat element in the 5'-end of X. Analysis identified new structural elements X that are evolutionarily conserved, such as an element proximal to the repeats important for X function. The study demonstrates the utility of Targeted StructureSeq to compare RNA conformations in vitro and in cells, and identifies novel conserved elements potentially functional. The approach is expected to advance mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs and develop conformation models of full X.
Researchers have developed a new statistical framework to evaluate the predictive power of genetic variants for complex diseases. Current methods mainly use the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess genetic tests, but it has limitations. The new framework connects various predictive indices, including AUC, mean difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases at highest risk, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. It also provides graphs to visualize performance, such as ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve. Simulations match theoretical estimates. The framework was applied to nine diseases, evaluating genetic tests for known variants. The study aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of predictive models, complementing AUC with other indices and graphs, especially when risk thresholds exist. Genome-wide association studies have identified many genetic variants for complex diseases, raising hope for individualized risk prediction. However, a single marker's effect is typically small, but a collection may be promising. Established risk thresholds lead to a large part of the ROC curve from non-clinical cutoffs. The framework can estimate indices and graphs given disease prevalence and heritability explained by variants.
Researchers developed a new rapid diagnostic test for Trypanosoma brucei gambense infection using recombinant antigens, called SDOLINEAT 2.0, and compared its accuracy to the current rapid test using native antigens, SDOLAT, and the traditional Card Agglutination for Trypanosomias (CATT). The study involved 57,632 individuals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 260 confirmed cases of African trypanosomiasis. SDOLAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity at 71.2%, followed by CATT 62.5% and SDOL 59%. CATT was the most specific at 99.2%, while SDOL and SDOL 2.0 were 98.9% and 98.1% respectively. The tests were more sensitive in passive screening than active. Combining two or three tests increased sensitivity, with SDOL and SD 2.0 reaching 98.4% and 83% in passive and active screening. The recombinant antigen test was as sensitive and specific as SDOL, but less specific than CATT. The study suggests using two or more tests could enhance diagnostic algorithms, but decrease specificity.
Researchers conducted a decade-long study in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala, a region with persistent Triatoma infestation, to evaluate the effectiveness of Chagas disease control activities. Initially, entomological and serological surveys were conducted in 1999 and 2001-2002, followed by three rounds of insecticide applications from 2003-2005 and intermittent spraying of infested houses until 2012. Household inspections and entom indices were conducted in 2001, 2007, and 201. Serological surveys were conducted in school-aged children in 199, 2007, and 201, and women of childbearing age 15-44 in 201. The infestation index decreased significantly from 39% in 2001-2 to 27 in 201, and household materials predicted <10% of infested houses. Chagas seropreval in school-aged children declined 10-fold from 10 in 199 to 1 in 201. However, serreval in women of child age remained >10. After a decade of control, there is evidence of reduced transmission, but continued risk of vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 202 Chagas elimination goal.
Citrobacterium is a natural pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in mice, sharing a virulence strategy with human pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The complete genome of Citrobium ICC168 was previously sequenced, displaying characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen. This study used PFGE sequencing, isolates variation, whole transcriptome analysis, and mobile genetic elements to show that Citium's genome is unstable due to repeat-mediated large-scale recombination and active transposition of mobile elements, such as prophages. An additional Citium strain EX-33 was sequenced, revealing that ICC168 is representative of the species, with most inactivating mutations common to both isolates occurring early in the pathogen's evolution. This parallels the evolution of other bacterial pathogens, suggesting Citium is a recently emerged pathogen alongside mouse development as a human disease model.

Citrobium isolates showed ICC features of bacteria passed through an evolutionary bottleneck, including pseudogenes and IS elements. This study investigates genomic flux in Citium, focusing on mobile elements' impact on evolution, demonstrating the pathogen's unstable genome. Citium shares virulence with EPEC and EHE, with isolates from mouse and hamster outbreaks in the 1960s, 70s 80s classified as atypical E. coli (M) or atypical Citacterii, later reclassified Citrob. Genetic and biochemical analyses suggested clonal origin, reclassifying Citrobium. The whole genome of Citium ICC168, from a 1972 outbreak, was sequenced, along with DB100 from the same source, most studied Citium isolates. Functions conferring Citium virulence to EPEC EHE are on horizontally acquired elements, with large genomic rearrangements and gene loss, suggesting Citium recently emerged as path, adapting lifestyle.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze stochasticity in gene expression by inferring biochemical rate constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from protein distributions. They derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution and found that these moments capture the shape of the protein distribution. An efficient algorithm was developed to infer gene expression constants from the moments of the protein distribution. The method was applied to a steady-state protein distribution and found that most distributions are consistent with a large number of biochemical constant sets, despite degeneracy, the solution space of constants always informs the underlying mechanism. The method distinguishes between transcriptional bursting and constitutive production regimes and agrees with the standard approach in the restrictive regime where it operates, also identifies constants not obtainable without assumptions. Estimates of individual rate constants or ratios were obtained in 91% of cases, and all underlying constants were identified in some cases. The framework will be a tool for deducing molecular contributions to patterns of gene expression.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine approach to protect against monkeypox (MPX), a disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPV), using a recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (Bo-4) vector. The Bo-4 vectors express different MPV glycoproteins, A29, M1, and B6, and were tested for protection against lethal MPV challenge in STAT knockout mice. Three recombinant Bo-4 vectors, Bo-4-CMV-A29g106TK, Bo-4-E1-MR106TK, and Bo-4-E-BR106, were successfully constructed and shown to express their transgene. A small-scale study found the vectors safe with no adverse events after intraperitoneal administration. Bo-4-E1-MR106 alone or in combination with Bo-4-C-A29 and Bo-4-BR protected 100% and 80% of STAT(-) mice from mortality and morbidity, respectively. This demonstrates the efficacy of Bo-4 vectors as a vaccine platform. 

MPV is an emerging zoonosis in tropical Africa, endemic in Congo and sporadic in West Africa, and a neglected disease in rural areas. Human interaction with wildlife increases MPV infection and human-to-human transmission is possible. Smallpox vaccination provides cross-protection, but the campaign ended in 1980, leaving a large population unprotected. Current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns and no FDA-approved therapies exist. New studies on pathogenesis, prophylaxis, and therapeutics are of interest for the scientific community and governments, as MPV could be a bioterror agent.
In trypanosomes, the major mRNA decay pathway is 5'-3' decay, where deadenylated mRNAs are decapped by the nudix hydrolase DCP of the decapping complex and degraded by the 5'-3 exonuclease. Unlike other eukaryotes, trypanosomes lack homologues to subunits of the decapping complex, while deadenylation and 5'- degradation are conserved. This study shows that trypanosomes use ApH-like phosphatase AL1 (AL1) as their major decapping enzyme. AL1 was identified as a novel trypan stress granule protein and involved in mRNA binding. A fraction of AL1 co-localises with the trypan 5'- exonuclease X to a granule at the posterior of the cell, indicating a connection between the enzymes. RNA depletion of AL1 is lethal and causes a massive increase in mRNAs that are deadenylated but not started 5'- decay, suggesting AL acts downstream deadeny and upstream of degradation, consistent with decapping. In vitro experiments show recombinant N-terminally truncated AL1 protein, but catalytically inactive, sensitises capped trypan spliced RNA to yeast X1, only with 5 polyphosphate included, indicating decapping mechanism differs from D2 by leaving more phosphate at 5 end.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells is sufficient to trigger their conversion into β-like cells. This process involves the mobilization of ductal precursor cells to adopt an endocrine fate, with glucagon cells being converted into β-like cells upon Ar inhibition. Analysis of Ar and Pax double-mutants shows Pax is dispensable for regeneration, indicating Ar as the main trigger of α-cell β-cell neogenesis. Loss of Ar in α-cells regenerates functional β-cell mass and reverses diabetes-induced β-cell depletion. Strategies targeting Ar expression or its targets may treat diabetes. The β-cell regeneration is able to counteract toxin-induced diabetes, maintaining euglycemia. Inactivation of Ar in embryonic and adult α-cells induces similar outcome. Lineage tracing shows glucagon cells, even at advanced ages, can convert into β-like cells upon Ar inactivation. Loss of gluc-producing cells initiates endocrine regeneration, gluc+ acquiring β-phenotype, leading to islet hypertrophy due β-like hyperplasia.
Eukaryotic cells have mechanisms to prevent the initiation of DNA replication at thousands of origins in their genome to minimize the probability of genomic alterations. Global regulatory mechanisms reduce the activity of initiation proteins, but origins initiate with diverse efficiencies when these are disabled. This suggests an additional layer of control that differentially regulates initiation at distinct origins. Novel elements are necessary for preferential initiation of two origins and confer preferential initiation on heterologous origins when control is partially deregulated. These elements, termed replication initiation promoters (RIPs), do not enhance S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins and act specifically as initiation promoters. RIPs map to ∼60 bp AT-rich sequences in a distance and sequence-dependent manner. During replication, Mc2 associates with origins that preferentially initiate and those that do not, indicating RIPs can overcome the block to initiation imposed by Mc2 association. This identifies a local level of control in the block to initiation, creating a complex landscape of replication potential revealed when global mechanisms are compromised. If replication contributes to alterations, as speculated in cancer, some regions may be more susceptible than others.
A study of 170 HIV-1-infected men in Japan found that the clinical features of invasive amebias caused by Entamoeba histoly were similar to those in non-HIV infected individuals, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP associated with extraintestinal ameb diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis and three from unrelated causes. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases, with luminal treatment provided to 83, but recurrence occurred in 6, similar to those without luminal treatment. Recurrence was more frequent in HCV-antib positive and syphilis acquired during follow-up. Various E histoly genotypes were identified but no correlation with clinical features or outcome. Metronidazole tinazole treatment of uncomplicated amebias was excellent in HIV-1 individuals, but luminal treatment post-treatment did not reduce recurrence in high-risk populations due to re-infection. A retrospective analysis of 170 HIV-1 patients showed no impact on immunocompromised status on amebias forms. Physical and laboratory findings showed fever, leukocyt, and CRP with extralinal ameb diseases. Results indicate excellent outcome for HIV-1 individuals with uncomplicated amebias treated metronazole tinidazole, in agreement with previous reports. Conventional management includes lum agent metronazole treatment to eradicate cysts.
Researchers conducted a study in the Mandoul area of South Chad to assess the impact of adding tset control to medical activities on the transmission of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis, caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambense. The area was a persistent focus of the disease with around 100 cases diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. The study aimed to determine if adding tset control to case detection and treatment could further reduce transmission and incidence. A census of the population was conducted and settlements mapped, followed by a pre-intervention survey of tse distribution and abundance in 2013. 260 targets were deployed in riverine habitats in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Impact on tse and incidence was assessed through nine surveys and medical surveys in 2014,201. Modelling was used to assess the relative impact of tset control on incidence compared to active and passive screening. The population of 74 inhabitants lived in the focus, with Glossina fuscipes and a mean catch of 0.7 tset/trap in 2013. Catch declined to 0.005set/trap after deployment. Modelling attributed 70.4% reduction in cases 2015 to vector control, 62.8% to tset, and 8.5 to enhanced detection. Predictions anticipate elimination by 2018 if control and screening continue, virtually no transmission since 201.
A retrospective study of 124 cases of imported strongyloidiasis in Spain from 2009-2017 found that most patients were immigrants (66.9%) from South America, with eosinophilia present in 82.2% of cases. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests made the diagnosis in the rest of the cases. Ivermectin compared to albendazole was the most strongly associated factor to achieve cure (OR 2.34). The study aimed to describe epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of patients with imported strongyloidis in Spain and identify factors related to parasite burden and treatment. Results differ from previous studies in non-endemic areas, such as Buenos Aires, Argentina, where iverectin treatment showed 100% cure rate. Imported strongyloidis is increasingly diagnosed in non-endemic countries, especially in Spain receiving immigrants from endemic areas. The study suggests screening for S. stercoral infection should be mandatory in patients from or traveling to endemic areas, especially immunocompromised.
Researchers have investigated the impact of the inoculum dose, or amount of antigen or attenuated pathogen, used in vaccines on host immunity and morbidity, with the goal of informing vaccine design. A higher inoculum doses stimulate a stronger immune response but may cause more severe side effects and limit population coverage during shortages. A combination of mathematical models and experimental data can determine the optimal inoculum. Using data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice and human parainfluenza (HIV) in rats at different inoculum doses, a model was fitted to map inoculum to immune protection and morbidity levels. The framework combines models with data to study inoculum's impact on outcomes such as protection and morbidity. Findings show inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity depend on the pathogen, and protection and morbidity do not increase monotonically with inoculum. Once protection and morbidity levels are specified, the framework can help design vaccines and determine the optimal inoculum. A modeling framework was developed to predict the optimal inoculum for a given vaccine setting, using data from live and inactivated vaccines. The framework can be applied to specific vaccine candidates to determine the optimal dose efficiently. The study contributes a conceptual, quantitative framework to rationally design and determine inoculum for any pathogen. Parameters were chosen to produce reasonable dynamics and explored inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity for a generic model.
Researchers studied the expression of the HetR gene, a transcription factor essential for heterocyst differentiation, in Anaba filaments under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions. They used a chromosomally encoded HetR-gfp fusion to analyze fluctuations in HetR expression at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments. Results showed that HetR fluctuations in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic range of two to three cells, setting the scale for cellular interactions along filaments. Correlations arise from intercellular molecular transfer and less cell division. Under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal HetR expression is influenced by the septal protein Sep and Het auto-regulation. A comparison of Het-gfp expression under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-p conditions highlighted differences between Het inhibitors PatS and Het, and sept proteins Sep and Fra/Fra. The study found that proteins involved in Het regulation combine to control fluctuations in expression, giving rise to a one-dimensional pattern in Anena.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI) in China, as demonstrated by molecular epidemiological surveillance. A serological survey in non-vaccinated pigs confirmed the shift at the seroepidemiological level, with an average ratio of GI/GIII of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of GI and GIII infections, with GI being more prevalent in pigs. To investigate the reasons for this shift, the replication of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, was compared in C/36 cells, chicken fibroblast (DF-1) and porine artery endothelial (PIE) cells. GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII in DF- and PIE cells, particularly in DF- with titers 22.9-225.3 higher than GIII. This suggests enhanced replication of GI in avian cells. In vivo, young ducklings were inoculated with GI and GIII at day post-hatching, and GI-inoculated developed higher viremia and displayed longer vmic duration than GIII-inoc. These results support the hypothesis of enhanced efficiency for GI in birds. Thirty-six amino acids differ between GI and GIII, some may be responsible for the replication efficiency of GI in birds. The findings suggest enhanced replication of GI in birds results in higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, increasing transmission in the birds-mosquito-bird enootic cycle, contributing to J genotype shift.
Candida albicans biofilm formation is a critical aspect of its pathobiology and is regulated by a network of six transcription factors: B1, B1, E1, N80, Rob1, Tec, and 1. To understand how these factors interact to regulate biofilm, researchers generated all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network and quantitatively analyzed interactions between them. The network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with six heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation (haploinsufficiency). Many double mutants are as affected as homozygous deletions, indicating a highly interdependent'small' network that is efficient but not robust. T1 is a component whose expression is sensitive to perturbations in other TFs. RO1 is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other TFs. Heterozygous N80 mutant is hyperfilous under bio and hypha-inducing in T-dependent manner. Genetic analysis provided insights into individual TFs and network topology in function.
Researchers investigated the role of asparagine synthase A (AS) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite responsible for sleeping sickness. AS converts aspartate to aspar in an ATP-dependent manner using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. There are two types of AS: ammonia-dependent and glutamine-dependent. AS is absent in humans but present in trypanosomes, making it a potential drug target. A previous study found AS was essential in Leish donani, making it a promising target. This study found that Leish infant AS uses both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources. They generated AS null mutants by gene replacement in Leish and found no significant growth or infectivity defects. However, severe growth impairment was observed in aspar limiting conditions. Results show AS is not essential for parasite survival or infectivity in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions, excluding it as a drug target against Leish.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. The study included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries with a total of 474 participants, 215 with epilepsy and 259 without. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between toxocari seropositivity and epilepsy. Meta-regression showed no significant heterogeneity and no association between covariates and outcome. The analysis found a positive association in Western blot (WB) diagnostic or confirmatory test, population and population-based studies. The meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between toxari seropitivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population studies. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxara-associated epileptogenesis.
Researchers have identified a new DNA damage response pathway mediated by the ATM protein, which plays a crucial role in repairing double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cells. When cells are exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), ATM is activated, leading to the downregulation of microRNA miR-335, which targets CtIP, a protein involved in homologous recombination repair (HRR). The study found that CREB, a transcription factor, is responsible for mi-335 expression by binding to its promoter region, and its activity is reduced after IR, consistent with previous studies showing ATM phosphorylates CRE to decrease its activity. Overexpressing mi-335 in HeLa cells resulted in reduced Ct levels and post-IR survival and BRCA foci formation. In two patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines with decreased post-IR survival, "radiosensitive" phenotype, mi-335 was elevated, Ct reduced, and BRCA foci. Colony survival, BRCA foci, and Ct levels were partially rescued by miRNA antisense AM-mi-335 treatment. The findings suggest an ATM-dependent CRE-mi-335-Ct axis influences HRR selection for certain DS lesions.
Researchers investigated whether sophisticated mentalizing, or attributing mental states to others, affects learning in social interactions. Participants played games against artificial agents with varying levels of sophistication, believing they were either playing against humans or in a casino. In the social framing, participants won against sophisticated agents, but lost in the non-social. Their choices were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing models in the social, but not non-social framing. This demonstrates the value of mentalizing in social interactions and shows intentional behavior can't be deciphered without attributing mental states to others. 

The study draws from behavioral economics and psychology, showing mentalizing enables adaptive skills like persuading and deceiving. Decisions in games involve recursive thinking, "I think you think I think...". Cognitive models of repeated games involve Bayesian recognition of others' intentions. The study extends this to mimic sophisticated mentalizing. Results align with social learning relying on specific processes predicting others' behavior. Social priors induce a sophisticated interpretation, involving mentalizing others, with recursive updates from observing behavior. The "social brain" hypothesis assumes others are Bayesian, implying mentalizing updates from observing behavior in mutual exchanges. The task-relevant information is identical in both framings. The prediction is that social framing induces mentalizing and recursive inference, while domain heuristics prevail in non-social are vulnerable to sophisticated agents.
Researchers have developed an efficient algorithm called FastGM for inferring Gaussian Graphical Models (GM) in biological networks. GM is a probability model that characterizes the conditional structure of a set of random variables by a graph, widely used in analyzing biological networks, such as inferring or comparing interactions. Current approaches are either statistically unsound or inefficient for high-dimensional data with thousands of variables. FastGM is based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. (2015) and estimates GM and p-value and confidence interval for each edge in the graph. Through simulations, it is shown to be faster by several orders of magnitude than the current algorithm by Ren et al without losing accuracy. It is applied to real data: transcriptomic from a childhood asthma study and proteomic from Alzheimer's disease, estimating global gene/protein networks for disease and healthy samples. The networks reveal interesting interactions and differential between cases and controls relevant to diseases. FastGM is a computationally fast and statistically sound procedure for constructing GM and inference with high-dimensional data, implemented in R package "FastGM".
Researchers investigated the optimal balance of striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network activity in the basal ganglia, a brain structure crucial for learning and executing movement sequences. They found that MSN population firing rates vary coherently on behaviorally relevant timescales. A model of the MSN network showed realistic activity only at certain connectivities and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPs) sizes. The study examined how MSN population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical activity, as in a behavioral task. At high connectivity, a "winner-takes-all" regime was found, where activity separates into stimulus-dependent firing and quiescent components. Only a few population rate components interact with cortical variations. Around a transition to a more active regime occurs, where cells switch between activity and quies. In this regime, MS components wander and are independent of cortical variations. Only in this regime, changes interact with many components, allowing sequential assemblies to be reproducibly activated for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset. Peristimulus histograms display strong stimulus and temporal specificity. This activity is maximized at striatal realistic connectivities and IP sizes. The MS network is optimized, not too stable to respond dynamically to cortical variations, nor too unstable to respond consistently. It generates stimulus-dependent patterns long after cortical excitation.
Researchers investigated the relationship between polarized exocytosis and endocyt in yeast cells, finding that the Rab GTPase Sec4 couples polarized exocyt with cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocyt. Using live cell imaging, in vitro binding assays, and actin polymerization assays, they showed that Sec4 binds to actin patch components Sla and Sla during assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its GEF Sec2 inhibit actin formation, while activating Sec4L accelerates assembly. In vitro assays, GTP-Secp overrides Sla inhibition of Lasp-dependent actin nucleation. Sec4 transiently localizes to endytic sites, disrupts actin assembly, interacts with Lasp, and induces Arp/3-dependent actin polymerization, suggesting a role in endyt apart from exyt. In yeast, polar sites of exytic vesicle fusion overlap with nascent endytic sites, dependent on both exyt and endyt. Sec4 also regulates actin assembly and endytic internalization, co-localizing with actin subunits Sla, Lasp, and Abp. It is proposed that Secp plays a role in Sla/Las regulation of Arp/3-dependent actin polymer, working in parallel with other regulators.
Acetamin-induced liver injury in mice is a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans, and understanding the mechanisms behind this phenomenon is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or reverse damage. The prevailing hypothesis is that location-dependent differences in NQI (reactive metabolite) formation within hepatic lobules (NQonation) are necessary and sufficient to account for the phenomenon, known as the NZech hypothesis. However, this hypothesis is challenged by the inability to control influential variables and require sequential intracellular measurements at different locations within the same mouse. Virtual hepatocytes configured to exhibit location-dependent behaviors, employing NZ-mech failed to achieve the phenomenon, suggesting at least one additional feature, such as glutathione depletion or mitochondrial damage, is required. Including both features enabled achieving the phenomenon, providing a multile, multiscale explanation of key features of acetamin hepatotoxicity in mice. Variants of the merged mechanism provide plausible explanations for variation in necrosis among genetically diverse strains following a single acetamin dose.
Researchers investigated the relationship between conventional diagnosis methods and quantitative DNA amplification in congenitally infected children with Trypanosoma cruzi. The study aimed to understand why not all neonates born to infected mothers can be diagnosed by microscopy immediately after birth. Results showed that infants with high parasitemia can be diagnosed by parasitological screening at 1 month of age, with 94% sensitivity in a one-year follow-up. Three groups were analyzed: A) neonates diagnosed by microscopy at 1 month (n=19), B) infants diagnosed at 6 months (n=10), and C) babies diagnosed by serology at 1 year (n=22). Group A had a median parasitemia of 1700/mL, B had 20-500/mL at 1 and 6 months, and C had 5-800-20/mL at 1 and 6 months. Parasites were isolated from 19 congenitally infected children, 18 were genotyped as DT Tc, and one as T. This is the first study to quantify parasitemia in over 50 congenitally infected children at 3 diagnostic controls. Parasite burden in 22 children was below detection limit of microscopy. Current treatment proved effective, but sensitive methods should be developed for early diagnosis.
Researchers have developed a coarse-grained biophysical model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and cellular composition based on a simplified representation of its genome. The model assumes E coli is in a state of balanced exponential growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment with rich resources. The model was applied to measurements of growth and rRNA-protein ratio in seven E coli strains with rRNA operon copy numbers ranging from one to seven, the wild-type number. Results showed growth decreased for strains with fewer copies. The model reproduced these measurements and suggested the fraction of macromolecules inside coli is not fixed when r operon number varied. Increasing beyond seven resulted in cytoplasm packed with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming overcrowding weakens binding affinities, the model predicted growth will not increase beyond wild-type rate, consistent with experiments. The model suggests changing r operon number in wild-type coli in constant environment does not increase growth. Other observations, such as nucle compaction and operon response, are qualitatively consistent. The model proposes principles and suggests further experiments to test its validity.
Arabidopsis thaliana MYB protein R1 (RSM) interacts with HY5/HY to modulate seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid and salinity. MYB transcription factors are involved in various biological processes, including metabolism, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. RSM, belonging to the MY-related subfamily, plays roles in plant development, stress, and hormone signaling. Downregulation or upregulation of RSM expression alters sensitivity of seed germination and cotyled greening to abisic acid (ABA), NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of RSM is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors ELONG HYCOTYL5 (HY) and HYHOMOLOG (HY) regulate R expression via the R1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal R mediates multiple functions of HY in responses seed germination postgermination to ABA and abiotic, and seedling to salinity. Pull-down and Bi assays show R interacts HYHY in vitro and vivo. R and HY may as a regulatory module in responses A and abiotic. R binds the promoter ABI5, regulating its expression, while R interaction stimulates HY binding the ABI. However, no evidence found dualucifer transient assay to support R enhances ABI by HY. In summary, HYHY and R may converge ABI promoter independently or dependently regulate ABI and ABI downstream A and stress genes, adapting plants to environment.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complex proton pump of the respiratory chain, links electron transfer from NAD to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Recent X-ray analysis of prokary and eukotic complex confirmed that redox reactions are confined to the hydrophil peripheral arm of the L-shaped molecule and take place at a distance from the membrane. This implies that proton pumping within the membrane of complex is driven via long-range conformation coupling, but the mechanism, number, and identity, and localization of pump sites remain unclear. Deletion of the gene for a small subunit of complex I, a stable sub (nbmΔ) is formed, lacking the dist part of the membrane domain. Analysis of subunit composition of holo and sub by proteomics revealed two subunits (ND4 and 5) with homology to bacterial Na+/H antiporters, discussed as prime candidates for harboring proton pumps, are missing in nbm. However, nbm still pumps protons at half stoichi of complete. Results provide evidence that membrane of complex harbors two functionally distinct pump modules connected by long helical element identified by X-ray analysis.
Researchers investigated the effect of fever on the binding affinity of antibodies to malaria and deng antigens in vitro. They used isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA to measure the binding of monoclonal antibodies to antigens at 37°C, 40°C, and 42°C. The results showed a marked increase in affinity of the antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C compared to 37°C or 42°C. Thermal equilibration of the proteins at these temperatures prior to measurements further increased binding. The study suggests a positive role for fever in vivo and highlights the favorable effect of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity for samples with limited availability.
Actomyos-based cortical flow is a fundamental process in cellular morphogenesis, generated by cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors, where motor activity is opposed by network resistance to deformation. Continuous flow requires local remodeling through cross unbinding and/or filament disassembly. A computational model of a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress was studied: asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover. The production and dissipation of network depend individually on cross dynamics and filament turnover, and these combine to determine cortical flow rates. The model predicts turnover is required to maintain stress against resistance and steady flow in response to external stress. Steady stress increases with lifetime up to a characteristic time τ, then decreases above τ. Effective viscosity increases with lifetime up to characteristic τ, then becomes independent of lifetime and dependent on cross dynamics. Dependencies of stress and viscosity define multiple regimes of steady flow. The model predicts when lifetimes are shorter than both τ and τ, dependencies of viscosity and stress on turnover cancel, flow is insensitive to turnover and shows dependence on activity and dynamics.
A novel quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on a Col-0/C24 population of Arabidopsis thalian to study seedling sensitivity to high sugar levels of glucose and fructose. A glucose and fructose-sensing QTL, GS11, was mapped through selective genotyping and confirmed in near-isogenic lines in Col and C24 backgrounds. Allelism and transgenic tests showed GS11 lies within the ANAC060 gene. The AN060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C allele. Genomic and mRNA analyses revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in AN060 affects splicing such that 20 nucleotides are present in the mRNA, creating a stop codon, resulting in a truncated AN060 protein lacking the transmembrane domain (TMD) present in C060. The absence of T results in nuclear localization of AN060. The short version of AN060 is found in 12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Glucose induces GS11/AN060 expression in a process requiring abisic acid (ABA) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient analysis showed ABI directly binds GS11/AN060 promoter to activate transcription. AN060 reduced ABA sensitivity and Gl-induced ABA accumulation, and ABI was reduced in AN060 lines. The sugar-ABA cascade induces AN060, but truncated AN060 attenuates ABA and signaling, resulting in insensitivity.
Researchers have investigated the role of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-G) signaling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that regulates various behaviors such as biofilm formation and motility. They found that the c-di-G synthase gene, hD, is located near the hB and flagellar genes and controls biofilm and motility through interaction with the anti-sigma factor hA. The rewiring of c-G signaling into the h pathway relies on the interaction between hD and hA and control of h localization at the cell poles. The study shows that h cannot complement the lack of h in the h background, supporting this model. The acquisition of h in P. aeruginosa and reorganization of hD, hB, hA, and flag and chemotactic genes form a novel entity controlling motility and biofilm. This reveals a scenario on the evolution of c-G signaling. A single DGC can transmit c-G and trigger a subset c-regulated behaviors, avoiding cross-talk through interaction with a molecular network regulating P. aerugin behaviors, the h pathway. The pathway controls biofilm, twitch, swimming, swarming, and chemotaxis in P. H and hD contribute to h-dependent bioformation, but have different impact on h-mediated motility. They act distinct in the c-G network controlling P. A mutant is defective in bio and hyper-swarming, while defect in swimming or twitch is observed. A local action of h at the pole is proposed. Two Ds, h and Sad, intersect the same regulatory G/R in hierarchical order. The cascade contributes the c-G necessary for P bioformation. H subsequently binds anti-sigma FlM, inducing flagellar expression. In absence h or unphosphorylated, acts as kinase phosphorylating h. This results decrease swarming and increase bioformation observed. The control P bio by h occurs reduction levels RY small RNA.
Researchers investigated how humans learn and generalize visuomotor mappings, or associations between visual cues and motor responses, in a rapid pointing task. Participants learned to point to targets with varying shapes that were morphed between circular and spiky, with different visuotor mappings for each shape. Feedback was provided with horizontal offsets dependent on the target shape, requiring participants to use different visom mappings to hit the target. After training, performance was tested without feedback on novel shapes not learned. Two hypotheses were tested: explicit extraction of the relationship between shape and visom mapping and generalization, and an implicit Bayesian model predicting categorization. Results showed participants applied the mapping to the most similar trained shape, consistent with the Bayesian model. The model also predicted slower learning with increased training pairs, confirmed by results. A correspondence was found between the model and results, suggesting it as a mechanism for learning multiple visom mappings.
Researchers investigated the relationship between climbing fiber bursts and subthreshold oscillations in the inferior olivary nucleus, a key input to the cerebellum. Climbing fibers are believed to convey timing information for motor commands and learning, causing large-or-all action potentials in cerebellar Purkin cells, silencing them for a brief period. Empirical evidence suggests climbing fibers can transmit bursts of spikes following olary somatic spikes, increasing information transfer to the cerebell. A three-compartment model of the olary cell was used to examine factors determining climbing burst size. Findings indicate phase dependency of burst size is present but limited, with charge flow between soma and dendrite a major determinant. This suggests phenomena like cell synchrony can affect climbing burst through dendritic junction coupling between olary cells. The cerebellum relies on two inputs: mossy fibers and climbing fibers, with the latter carrying sensory information. It's proposed variability in olary spike shape allows transmission of more information than expected. Phase dependency of CF size and somatic spike count enables coarse encoding of temporal information. The model predicts phase dependency in a limited range of ST amplitudes and cell ensembles. IO cells fire at 1 Hz, limiting spike coding over multiple events, making machine learning less accurate. A deeper understanding of IO electrophysiology is needed to understand what it can transfer to the cerebell. The model predicts correlation between ST phase and spike count, consistent with Mathy et al. A quantitative estimate is required for cerebell models, hard to explain with IO data due to low firing rate. Simulations mimicking Mathy's experiment with 5 Hz ST imposed on the cell and control experiments with no current were run.
A computational model of liver metabolism has been developed to understand the regulation of iron in the body. Iron is essential for life but can be toxic in excess, and the liver plays a key role in maintaining safe levels. Misregulation is linked to various diseases, and understanding iron metabolism has led to a detailed map of its fate in the body. However, a quantitative understanding of how its components interact to produce regulation remains elusive. The model includes core components and was constructed based on known mechanisms and kinetic properties from publications. It was validated by comparing results with published data and reproduced multiple findings. A simulation of an oral iron dose was compared to a clinical study and recreated the dynamics and scale of response. A disease simulation of hereditary hemochromatosis was created by altering a reaction mimicking a mutation, providing a quantitative understanding of overload. The model supports the liver's role as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling to identify targets and design experiments to improve knowledge.

The model allows "what-if" experiments leading to hypotheses to be tested. A comprehensive liver metabolism model does not exist, previous models cover specific events, such as iron loading in ferritin. A map of mammalian metabolism provides an overview of molecular interactions in metabolism, including cell types. Existing models are at extremes of detail, specific and generic, to address hepatic regulation, a balance is desirable. The model aims to address this. Quantitative modelling in detail is hindered by lack of values for interactions. The model and results predictions about regulation should be investigated. It is the most detailed model to date, allowing description of regulation, and can link genotype to phenotype, demonstrated with hereditary hemromatosis. Due to limited data, other sources, particularly in vitro and animal, were integrated for parameterisation. This modelling constitutes a clinical approach, enabling data to improve understanding metabolism. The involved iron, transport, and regulation form a complex network. The liver has a role in regulation through secretion of hepcid. The hepatic network in sensing and regulation was analysed through a model and simulation.
Researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to simulate nucleocytoplasmic transport. The model takes into account the polymeric nature of FG-repeats on the NPC structure and the hydrophobic affinity between kaps and FG domains. Brownian dynamics simulations predict the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex to be 2.6 ± 0.13 ms with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The cargo-com is primarily attached to the wall and interacts with the FG-layer as it passes through the channel. Kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient transport. Almost all hydrophobic spots on kap-β are occupied during transport. In contrast, cytoplasm filament-deficient NPCs show high permeability to cargos, indicating a role in selectivity. The model captures transient interactions between FG-re and cargo on the order of nanoseconds, resolving uncertainties in nucleocytoplasm transport. Simulations probe the NPC to examine events leading to the N cycle. The NPC is the gateway for material across the nuclear envelope, regulating transcription and protecting genetic material in eukary cells. The model corroborates findings for different cargo sizes, showing radial distribution and trajectory of a 15 nm-complex. FG-re are central in proposed models, with distinctions from speculations about properties and arrangement within NPC and interaction with kaps during transport.
Researchers have developed an optimized protocol to determine the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for non-human primate (NHP) models, which are commonly used to test interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The goal is to find the dose that infects 50% of animals (ID50), with other doses like ID80 easily calculated from the same data. This minimizes the number of animals and resources while estimating ID50 within 1.5-fold of true value. Ethical and economic constraints require using few animals to achieve significant biological results. In HP models, a limiting dose is desired, infecting a fraction of animals at exposure. Limiting dose requires titration: too high leads to false negatives, too low to insufficient infections. A 2-fold error impacts experiment power. The protocol enrolls 15-25 animals, 3-5 rounds, and estimates ID within 40% of true. It's generalizable to any pathogen and model, but critical in HP where animal use is minimized. ID50 is determined by iterative exposures to pathogen dilutions, adjusting dose between rounds to achieve 50% infection. The relationship between probability of infection (P) and dose (D) is understood.
Researchers studied the adaptation of a first-order auditory neuron (AN2) in crickets in response to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli and found that it adapts with a time constant of 1.5 seconds, shifting the stimulus-response curve towards higher intensities and reducing responses to low-intensity sounds. They investigated whether this adaptation improves signal representation by comparing it to two hypotheses: infom, which maximizes information across the signal range, and selective coding, which enhances foreground signals while suppressing background. The team tested adaptation's effect on input-response curves with signals having two or three peaks in amplitude, which infom and selective predict conflicting changes. Using Bayesian analysis, they quantified response shifts and found slight decreases in slopes and higher absolute thresholds than inf's predictions. Contrary to inf, adaptation reduced information across the signal's range. Response changes also didn't align with selective, as loudest signal's information didn't increase but remained constant, with less transmitted about lower-intensity signals.
Researchers investigated the role of polybasic domains in prion protein (Pr) in the propagation of disease-associated prion (PrSc). They created prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains, expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and used them as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sCA) reactions. After 5 rounds of sCA, PrSc molecules lacking the central poly domain (Δ) formed, but surprisingly, in contrast to wild-type prions, Δ-PrSc prions could bind and induce conversion of poly domain mutant substrates into PrSc molecules. Notably, Δ-PrSc and poly domain PrSc displayed diminished or absent infectivity relative to wild Pr, despite seeding normal brain homogen sCA ability. These results suggest a dissociation between seeding ability and infectivity, indicating that PrSc propagation may not depend on a single mechanism, and Pr/Sc interaction through poly domains may be required for infectivity. Studies of Pr fragments showed poly domains interact PrSc, and to investigate this in full Pr, mutant proteins were designed lacking one or both domains, which were detergent-sol and properly trafficked. A novel capture assay found both domains required optimal PrSc binding. Reconstituted sCA with wild and mutant substrates showed poly domains required for efficient PrSc propagation. PrSc lacking either domain did not bind or propagate wild efficiently, suggesting both domains contact PrSc for efficient propagation. Using CHO expression, purification, and reconstitutedCA techniques, PrSc lacking poly domains were engineered, which propagated robustly in vitro, allowing assessment of poly domains in PrSc docking and propagation. Results suggest N-terminal poly domain participates in wildSc binding and propagation. sCA seeded with wild pr were carried out 3-5, Δ-PC molecules converted to resistant digestion under stringent conditions.
Researchers developed an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework to identify the behavioral strategies used by animals to control their movement in an environment. They applied this framework to Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) thermotaxis behavior, where worms move towards or away from a temperature gradient. The IR approach revealed that fed worms used both absolute and temporal temperature information to control their movement, employing two strategies: directed migration (DM) towards the temperature and isothermal (IM) migration along a constant temperature. In contrast, starved worms used only absolute temperature information to escape the temperature. The researchers also investigated the neural basis of these strategies by applying the method to thermosensory-deficient worms. The IR-based approach is useful for identifying animal strategies from behavioral data and can be applied to various studies, including decision-making in other organisms.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Chrychromina tobin, a type of alga in the Prynesiales order, and analyzed its transcriptome over a 24-hour light-dark cycle. The genome is 59 megabases in size, 40% of which is protein-coding, and encodes 16,777 genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct expression patterns over the circadian photoperiod. The genome harbors a hybrid polyketide synth/non-ribosomal synthase complex, anti-microbial peptides, and proteins for multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. A new alga xanthodin was identified, along with two RuBisCOases shared across algal lineages. The Chrychromina tobin genome provides information on evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of algaes. This is the second alga with both nuclear and chloroplast genomes sequenced. The genome is compact, gene-rich, and shows lateral gene transfer events contributed to its evolution. The chloroplast has small, inverted repeats, unlike chlorytic chloroplasts, and unique genes. Chrychromina is the second alga with both genomes sequenced. The nuclear and chloroplast have identical coding for activases, indicating co-dependence on ecoh for survival.
Research has shown that breast cancers lacking estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) markers belong to the Basal molecular subtype, which is often associated with defective BRCA1 and p53 pathways. Studies in mice demonstrate that inactivation of both BRCA and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress cell death in mammary epithelium, and concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features common to human BRCA-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses show that tumors share attributes of Bas-like and Claudin-low signatures, two subtypes encompassed by broader triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.

BRCA1 is mutated in 20-30% of human breast cancers and defective pathway intermediates increase breast cancer risk. Nearly all Bas-like cancers with BR1 have conitant p mutation. Gerine BR1 mutation predisposes early breast cancers that are triple-negative and correlate with Bas-like in microarray. Our results show conitant inactivation of three tumor suppressor pathways in mammary has additive effect on latency and predis highly malignant carcinomas. Although BR1 accelerated tumorigenesis compared TP, we observed no statistical difference chromosomal number in tumors or without BR1, despite extensive CNs by others BR1/p53.

Mouse models mimic complexity of TNBC are invaluable for defining cellular behavior and rigorously triaging new candidates. Bas-like cancers inactivate three suppressors infamous roles familial: RB, p53, and BR1. Others argued Bas-like and Claudin signatures reflect progenitor and cell phenotypes, consistent BR mediating stem/progen maturation. Loss BR activity alter phenotype deregulation EMT inducer SL. CG analysis revealed CN consistent mutations human surveys breast.
Researchers conducted a study in Kampha Phet, Thailand to model the production of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of deng virus, from 2004 to 2007. They collected 84,840 water samples from containers and used regression modeling to assess the effect of larval site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. A varying-coefficients model accounted for differences in productivity between container types, and a hurdle model accounted for zeroes and overdispersion in pupal counts. The study found that the number and density of larval sites were primary determinants of Aegypti distribution and abundance. Productivity of containers increased with habitat density. An ecological approach accounting for site density is suitable for predicting Aegi population and developing control programs. Aedesegi primarily develops in artificial water containers, and recapture studies indicate adults do not disperse long distances. Containers in high-density areas are likely oviposition sites and used more frequently than isolated ones. Accounting for container characteristics, frequently used sites produce adults at higher rates. Most Aegi studies ignore spatial larval site density.
Researchers investigated the role of the Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TOR2) in mediating gut-to-brain signaling in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that TOR2 coordinates larval development and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state. During larval development, pherom, food, and temperature regulate the expression of daf-7 TGF-β and d-28 insulin-like peptide in sensory neurons to promote a decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. TOR2 acts in the intestine to regulate expression of d-7 and d-28, reflecting bacterial-dependent feeding status, providing a mechanism for integration of food with external cues in regulation of neuroendocrine expression. In the adult, TOR2 acts in intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging via PDF-2/PDF-1 neuropeptide-dependent pathway. Genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes and identifies quantitative loci (QTL) associated with traits. Results suggest TOR2 as a hub for communication of feeding information from gut to brain, contributing modulation of neuronal function by state.
Researchers analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and primordial germ cells to identify genes upregulated in pluripotent cells in vitro and in vivo. These genes were enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A novel algorithm, Compoby, was developed to predict short DNA motifs regulating gene expression by combining aligned and non-aligned sequences with a probabilistic segmentation model. Compoby identified conserved motifs in upregulated pluripotent cells, which were active in undifferentiated ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner and acted as enhancers with an endogenous promoters. Importantly, activity was conserved in human ES cells. Transcription factor-Y bound one motif, differentially expressed during ES differentiation and required for cell proliferation. This study provides insights into transcriptional networks of pluripotent cells, suggesting systematic approach can be applied to mammalian species.
Researchers have characterized the structure of a soluble heterodimer complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus N protein (N) lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (ΔN21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P) encompassing the molecular recognition element (Mo) of P that binds to RNA-free N. The complex crystallized in a decameric form was solved at 3.0 Å resolution, revealing how Mo folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy confirmed the binding of Mo and indicated that flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure suggests a mechanism for initiation of viral RNA synthesis.

The N-binding region is localized in the N-terminal disordered region and contains transient helical elements that constitute a molecular recognition element (Mo) that folds upon binding to partner. The reconstituted NΔ-P complex is a model for viral N-P in agreement with previous studies. Crystal and NMR experiments show Mo of P adopts conformation upon binding to N, including residues 6-35, corresponding to fragment essential for maintaining N in soluble (aa 11-30).

The heterodimer N-P crystallized under conditions assembled a decamer of heteromers similar to previously crystallized decam N-RNA. The structure of decam form N-P reveals mechanisms N-binding Mo attaches to N. A single VSV N variant incapable of binding crystallized decam assembly empty molecules.
Researchers investigated the role of gap junctions in the fly's visual system, specifically in the vertical (VS) network, which processes visual information. Gap junctions, or electrical synapses, are a type of connection between neurons that allows for direct electrical communication. The study found that gap junctions enable the VS to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly's motion, within 10 milliseconds of visual input onset. This efficiency is near-optimal, meaning it reaches the physical limits set by the visual input's statistical structure. The VS is connected to downstream pathways via a subset of cells, and the subpopulation with gap junctions encodes θ more efficiently than the whole network, and is robust to various signal-to-noise ratios. This efficient encoding is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Gap junctions only impact the system's readout, not the dendritic input, suggesting neural circuit principles may be richer than previously thought. The study shows how specific connectivity leads to efficient sensory encoding.
Researchers have identified human-select glycoprotein ligand-1 (PS-1) as a receptor for enterovirus 71 (EV) entry and replication in leukocytes. PS-1 is a sialucin on the surface of leukocytes, serving as a high-affinity counterceptor for selectins and mediating leukocyte rolling on endothelium. The PS-1-select interaction requires sulfation of at least one of three tyrosines and adjacent O-glycan sial Lewis in the N-terminal of PS-1. To elucidate the molecular basis of PS-1-EV interaction, researchers generated PS- mutants and identified post-translational modifications critical for PS binding to EV. They expressed PS mutants in 293 cells and transfected cells were assayed for abilities to bind EV by flow cytometry. O-glycosylation on T57, critical for PS-select interaction, was not necessary for PS binding to EV. Site-directed mutagenesis at one or more tyrosine sulfation sites in N-terminal PS significantly impaired PS binding to EV. Inhibitor of sulfation, sodium, chlorate, blocked PS-EV interaction and inhibited PS-mediated replication in Jurkat cells in dose-dependent manner. Tyros sulfation, not O-gcosylation, in N-terminal of PS may facilitate entry and replication of EV in leukocytes.
Researchers investigated the therapeutic potential of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in controlling Leishmanias, a global health problem affecting millions worldwide. Current treatments are limited by toxicity and emergence of resistant strains. Inhibitors of mTOR have shown anti-parasitic properties. This study tested three mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin, G-645, and K-379, in BAL/c mice infected with Leish major. Foot swelling and parasite burden were assessed, and cytokine production by splenocytes and phenotypic changes in draining lymph nodes evaluated. Treatment with clinically relevant doses of rapycin or G-645, but not K-379, reduced foot swelling and parasite load in lymph nodes. Importantly, rapycin did not kill promastigotes in vitro. IL-4 production by splenocytes from rapycin-treated mice was reduced, and IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio elevated, indicating a Th1-skewed cytokine profile. Expression of CD, an activation marker, on splenic and node CD+ and CD+ T cells was enhanced in rapycin mice. Findings suggest mTOR inhibitors may be used in leishias management, proposing beneficial effects from immunomodulatory properties.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between DNA uptake sequence (DUS) and its cognate receptor ComP during natural transformation in Neisser species. Transformation is a biological process where competent bacteria take up free DNA, incorporate it into their genomes, and become genetically altered. To prevent deleterious transformation by foreign DNA, competent species preferentially take up their own DNA containing specific US marks. The study found that Com is the long US receptor in Neisser species, paving the way for functional analysis of US-Com interdependence. By modulating Com levels in Neisser meningidis, they showed that enhancement of transformation in presence of US is dependent on Com, which also controls transformation in absence of US. Inner bases of US are essential, as single mutations led to impaired interaction with Com and transformation. Naturally occurring US variants in human Neisser commens differing from US by one or two bases were impaired for transformation of N meningidis. By showing Com from N subava comm specifically binds cognate US and mediates US-enhanced transformation in com mutant N meningidis, they confirm similar mechanism used by Neisser species to promote their or closely related DNA.
In the process of cytokinesis in yeast cells, a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and septum formation are crucial for cell division. While many CAR proteins have been identified, how they interact with septum enzymes to form the septum remains unclear. This study shows that cooperation between Pxl, a paxillin homolog required for ring integrity, and B1, the enzyme for linear (1,3) glucan synthesis and septum formation, is necessary for CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane before septation and cleavage. Without Pxl and B1, ring contraction fails and cell overgrowth occurs without septum formation. Pxl concentration at CAR increases during cytokinesis, dependent on the SH domain of protein Cdc15. B1 depletion in cells with cdcΔ3 allele causes ring disassembly and sept block, as in P1 lacking cells. P1 absence is lethal when C15 function is affected, causing CAR sliding with septum deposition along cortex. Findings indicate CAR anchorage through C15 and Pxl, concom B1 activity necessary for CAR and septum formation in yeast. B1 and P1 cooperate to maintain CAR position and integrity during cytokinesis, essential for septum synthesis. Rho GTPase inactivation is required for septum in Saccharomy cerevisiae. P1 deletion increases R1 activity, impeding septum upon B1 repression in px1 cells. C15 through SH, likely Pxl cooperates with B1 to confer stability CAR and form sept during cytokinesis.
A recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia malle, occurred in Bahrain. To investigate the outbreak, researchers applied high-resolution genotyping (multiple locus number of variable tandem repeats, MLVA) and whole-genome sequencing to B. malle isolates from infected horses and a camel. The results were compared to samples from an outbreak in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 and placed into a broader phylogeographic context based on previously published B. malle data. The Bahrain samples separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting a complex epidemiological background and involvement of multiple B. malle strains. The samples from Bahrain were more closely related to B. malle isolated from horses in the UAE 2004 than other B. malle, suggesting repeated importation to the region from similar sources. High-resolution genotyping and whole-genome analysis revealed phylogenetic patterns among samples. The relationship of Dubai/UAE B. malle populations may indicate a similar geographic origin yet to be identified for infecting strains. The emergence of glanders with worldwide horse trading poses a risk for human infections.
A cross-sectional study of 43 patients with cutaneous leishmanias (ACL) who did not respond to treatment with Glucime (pentavalent antimonial) was conducted in three Colombian National Army reference centers. The study aimed to characterize clinical and parasitological features of these patients. Leishmania braziliensis was the predominant species (95.4%) and 35% of parasites showed decreased susceptibility to Glucime in vitro. Lesion size and infectivity were negatively correlated with Glime susceptibility (Spearman r=-0.548 and -0.726 respectively). A negative correlation between lesion size and resistance was documented. L. braziliensis was the main species associated with treatment failure or relapse. The study suggests a second round of treatment with pentavalent derivatives may not be effective for L. brazili. Inclusion criteria were male patients with at least one round of Glime 20mg/kg/day for 20 days, experienced relapse or ATF. Female, incomplete or unsupervised treatment were excluded. The study was conducted from June 2013 to March 2014 in three reference centers for complicated cutaneous leishiasis (CCL) of the Colombian Army. The new form of CL tends to be more severe and longer than the old. In Colombia, majority ACL cases are by Leish Viannia (V) subgenus. Species in this group are associated with MCL and prone to failure than Leish Leish (L) sub. Leish intracellular parasites to U-937 was determined for Glime concentration. IC50 was the concentration that reduced survival Leish by half using CONF function. Epidemiological, clinical, and parasitological characteristics of Leish spp associated with lesions, such as species, in vitro susceptibility and infectivity were analyzed.
Researchers investigated the interplay between the biosynthetic pathways of siderophores and colactin genotoxin in Escheria coli, focusing on the role of 4-phosphopantin transferase (PT) enzymes. Two PTases, EntD and Clb, have been identified, with Ent being part of the core genome and Clb encoded on a pathogenic island pks. The p island is associated with high pathogenic island H in highly virulent E coli strains, which carries genes for yiniact synthesis except its cognate PT. The study demonstrated Clb can contribute to siderore synthesis, and inactivation of both Ent and Clb abolished virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E coli (Ex) in a mouse sepsis model. Presence of either functional Ent or Clb was required for Ex survival in vivo. This is the first report of multiple phosphantin-requiring pathways leading to distinct metabolites in a microorganism. The association of p island with H in highly vir E coli may be due to Clb being a promuous PT contributing to genoto and siderores.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model for multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by a gap character. Starting from a continuous Markov process, they constructed a non-reversible (birth-death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions, assuming events occur one residue at a time. This model was applied to phylogenetic inference by extending the program dnaml in phyl. Benchmarking on simulated and real ribosomal RNA data showed that the extended dnaml improved accuracy relative to ignoring gaps while retaining Felsen peeling algorithm efficiency. A fundamental task in sequence analysis is calculating probability of multiple alignment given phylogen tree and evolutionary model. Widely used phylogen models only account for residue events, not insertions and deletions. Felsen pe algorithm efficiently calculates ungapped alignment probability given model and tree, scaling linearly with length and number of sequences. Its economy makes it basis for maximum likelihood methods in phylogen inference tools, including phyl, paup, and others. The new model describes single residue evolution in column given phylogen tree, with total alignment probability as product of column probabilities.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infects the mucosal epidermis before entering nerve endings, but the mechanism of immunity initiation is not fully understood. In mice, epidermal Langerh cells (LCs) are the first dendritic cells (DCs) to encounter HSV, but CD103+ dermal DCs carry viral antigen to lymph nodes for presentation, suggesting cross-talk in the skin. This study compared topically HSV-1 infected human skin explants with biops of initial genital herpes to show LCs initially emigrate into the dermis, forming clusters with BD3+ dermal DCs and DC-S+ macrophages. HSV-expressing LC fragments were observed inside dermal DC/macrophages and BD3 dermal DC upregulated damaged uptake receptor CLEC9. No epidermal cells interacted with dermal DCs. LC isolated from skin infected with HSV-1 in vitro underwent apoptosis and were taken by BD3 dermal DC and S+ cells. A viral relay takes place where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DC for antigen presentation. This provides rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization.

HSV-1 infects epidermal LCs, which then emigrate into dermis, forming clusters with BD3 dermal DC and S macrophages. BD3 dermal DC upregulate damaged uptake receptor C9. No epidermal cells interact with dermal DC. LC isolated from skin infected HSV-1 in vitro undergo apoptosis and are taken by BD3 dermal and S cells. A viral relay occurs where infected LC undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal for antigen. This provides rationale for targeting cells with muc or intrader immunization.
Researchers studied the formation of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mouse macrophages infected with Leishmania major or Leish major amastigotes using multidimensional imaging. They found that PVs housing one or two L major amastigotes were tight-fitting, while PVs housing many L amazon amastigotes were giant. The study characterized PV biogenesis and remodeling in macrophages hosting amigotes of L major or amazon and loaded with lysotracker, a lysosotropic probe. Three features of Leish amigote-hosting PVs were documented: entry of lysacker into tight-fitting, fission-prone L major PV, decrease in macrophage vesicles during L major PV and amazon PV enlargement, and amazon PV remodeling homotypic fusion. Multidimensional imaging provided new insights into Leish species differences in PV biogenesis and could be useful for studying other intracellular microorganisms.
Researchers investigated how chromatin structure influences the use of homologous sequences as donors for repair in homologous-directed repair using the chicken cell line DT40 as a model. Immunoglobulin genes in DT40 undergo sequence diversification through gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. The immunoglobulin V pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. The study demonstrated the importance of chrom structure for conversion using a regulatable system where heterochrom protein1 (Drosoph melanogaster var205) was expressed as a fusion to Escheria lactose repressor, tethered to polymerase operators within the pseudoλ array. Tethered HP diminished histone acetylation within pseudoλ and altered the outcome ofλ diversification, favoring non-templated mutations over templated mutations. Chromatin regulates homolog-directed repair. Histone modifications may contribute to genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.
Researchers investigated the role of cerebellar climbing fibers in motor learning, specifically in a saccadic paradigm, a model of cerebell-based motor learning. Contrary to the assumption that climbing fibers only convey immediate error information for synaptic modification, the study found a clear spike signature of error at the time of occurrence and a reverberation of this signature later, before new behavior manifestation. This challenges the concept that climbing fibers' role is confined to instant error communication. A previous studies on short-term sacc adaptation (STSA) showed patterns inconsistent with this idea, indicating a shift between populations indicating alteration of sacc amplitude by CS in primary interval. Simple spike (SS) and complex spike (CS) firing patterns in motor learning are established, suggesting CS effects might be secondary to error changes in SS discharge. To address this, a random sacc adaptation paradigm was used, avoiding gradual behavioral changes and error obscuring electrophysiological fingerprint. Results showed statistically significant changes in CS rate, reflecting past errors before upcoming sacc. This contrasts with previous findings on climbing's role in sacc learning, characterized by seemingly incompatible results, assuming information for future behavior improvement is conveyed by climbing fibers from inferior olive.
Researchers used a yeast model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) to study the effects of TDP-43, a protein associated with the disease. They found that overexpression of TDP-43 leads to cell toxicity and reduced ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, a process that breaks down misfolded proteins. Overexpression of the heat shock protein S1 (Hsp1) reduced T-43's effects on cell toxicity and proteolysis. This effect was influenced by the presence of the endogenous yeast protein Pin1. Overexpression of S1 altered T-43's aggregation pattern, but no physical association between S1 and T-43 was detected. The mammalian S1 homologue, DNA1, also reduced T-43 mediated toxicity in rodent cortical neurons, suggesting S1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS. T-43 aggregation is associated with ALS and other diseases, and overexpressed T-43 forms cytoplasmic aggregates in yeast and mammalian neurons. The study found that T-43 inhibits clearance of misfolded protein by the ubiquitin proteome, consistent with some T-43 toxicity caused by proteolytic dysfunction. Many heat shock proteins have distinct functions in mammalian cells, one of which, DNA1, has similarity to S1. Overexpression of WT and mutant T-43 with familial ALS in rodent neurons showed DNA1 extended survival. The yeast model identified S1 as a modifier of T-43 toxicity, and mammalian S1 homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.
A study was conducted to investigate the parasite load and molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in patients with Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. Sixty-five patients with chronic Chagas disease were recruited, aged 26-76 years, with a median of 54, being 34 females and 31 males. Thirty-five (53.8%) presented positive amplification by real-time PCR, 20 (30.7%) with the indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite median load for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43-11.14] parasite/mL, ranging from 0.12 to 153.66. The load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old, median 20.05 [18.29-86] parasite/mL. Using guanidine-ED blood spiked with T. cruzi strains, it was possible to genotype up to 0.5 parasite/mL with high specificity. Twenty-eight (80%) of patients with positive PCR identified T. cruzi DT, while 20% had partial results. Analysis showed prevalence of TVI, TII, and mixed TVI+II equal 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3%, respectively. Two were infected by TV and one co-infected by III+VI, all in chronic chasic cardiomyopathy stage, born in Bahia, northeast Brazil. T cruz genotypes compared to load showed elevated loads in infected II (median 7.56 parasite/mL) compared to VI (2.35/mL). However, frequency of cardiomyopathy was 50% in VI and 16.7% in II.
A study on rabies in bats was conducted in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011, as part of a larger pathogen detection program. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies, with a low prevalence of 0.3% of rabies virus (RV) detection. Viral antigens and infectious virus were isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). RV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, whereas viral RNA was detected in all tissues by hemi-nested RT-PCR except the liver of one. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein showed both viruses were 100% identical, whereas glycoprotein sequencing revealed one nonsynonymous substitution (302T). The two vampire RV isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. 7% of sera from 398 bats demonstrated RV neutralizing antibodies. The proportion of seropositive bats varied across troph guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RV perpetuation. This is the first report of RV isolation from bats in Guatemala, with a low prevalence of 0.3% among all bats, and 1.3% among vampire bats. The RV isolates were related to viruses in eastern Mexico and El Salvador, due to geographic proximity. Viral RNA was detected in all tissues except the liver of one bat.
Researchers investigated the role of lamin A in herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication and found that it plays a crucial role in targeting the viral genome to the nuclear periphery and reducing heterochromatin on viral promoters. In lamin-deficient (Lna/−) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), viral replication compartments were reduced in size and failed to target the periphery as in wild-type (WT) cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies showed HSV associated with increased heterochatin in Lna/− MEFs. Results suggest lamin A is required for viral expression, replication, and growth, with greatest effect on replication at low multiplicity of infection. Lamin/C serves as a scaffold for DNA and protein complexes regulating euchatin and heterochatin modifications. The study provides evidence for lamin-dependent targeting of HSV to the periphery associated with reduction of heterochatin on lytic genes, suggesting a role in lamin maintenance of heterochatin and silencing.
Researchers have investigated the structure of the translocase of outer membrane (TOM) complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically anaerobic form of mitochondria found in the excav Trichomonas vaginalis. They found that the highly divergent β-barrel TvTom-40 forms a translocation channel to conduct hydrogenosomal import and is present in high molecular weight complexes with four subunits. Two of these subunits, Tom36 and Tom46, have heat shock protein (Hsp) and tetratopeptide repeat (PR) domains that bind hydrogenosomal proteins and likely function as receptors. A third subunit Tom22 has a short domain and conserved transmembrane segment but lacks a domain. The fourth protein hydrogenosomal outer membrane 19 (Hom19) has no homology. Data also indicate that TvOM is associated with sorting and assembly (SAM) 50 involved in β-bar assembly. Visualization of TvOM by electron microscopy revealed it forms three pores with an unconventional skull-like shape. Although TvOM lacks Tom7, phylogenetic profiling predicts Tom in freeiving excavates. The study suggests that the tripletore TOM complex, composed of conserved subunits, was present in the common eukotic ancestor (LECA) while receptors for substrate binding evolved in eukotic lineages.
Researchers conducted a comparative eQTL analysis of CD4+ and CD8 T cells to investigate the pathogenic implications of autoimmune mechanisms. They found that inappropriate or inadequate regulation of these cells contributes to the initiation and progression of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The study highlighted the importance of biological context for regulatory variants, particularly in understanding the immune system's genetic regulation and cellular phenotypes. The analysis revealed type-specific regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases in CD+ and CD8 cells, including a trans-regulatory locus on chromosome 12q13.2 containing the rs101 SNP in the R26 gene. A missense variant in IL27 was identified, associated with type 1 diabetes, resulting in decreased protein activity and expression of IR1 and STAT in CD+ cells. The results indicate that eTL mapping in purified cells provides novel insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases. A missense variant in IL27 was found to affect the STAT and IR1 pathway in CD+ cells, conferring protection against type 1 through inhibited expression of IR1 and STAT. The study also suggests IL may promote autoimmunity towards pancreatic islets via upregulation of the STAT pathway. Regulatory CD+ T cells have a central role in controlling autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Genome-wide association studies identified thousands of SNPs associated with immune-related diseases. The eTL in CD and CD cells revealed multiple effects on genes associated with autoimmune, demonstrating high specificity and sensitivity despite smaller sample sizes.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), socio-economic factors and cultural barriers hinder the uptake of screening and treatment for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). A qualitative study was conducted in Bandu and Kasa Oriental provinces, two provinces lagging behind in H elimination efforts, to understand these barriers. Semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were held with current and former H patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the National Trypanosomiasis Control Program. Interviews and discussions were recorded and analyzed using ATLAS software. Participants mentioned taboos to be respected for six months after H treatment: no work, no sex, no food, and no sun exposure. Violating these restrictions is believed to cause severe and deadly complications. These tabos are well-known and lead people to avoid H screening due to fear of observing them upon diagnosis. Originally aimed to mitigate melarsol's adverse effects, they are not evidence-based and obsolete with new safer drugs. Health providers must address community perspectives to keep abreast of transformations. 

In DRC, understanding these tabos and their origin is crucial for H control as coordinated by the National Trypaniasis Program. Rhodesian H. Medical advice transformed into tabos entertained by providers and community in these regions. They determine suboptimal uptake of H screening. Tabos might be abandoned with safer options, observed with NECT. Restrictions negatively affected participation and adherence. Their origin unclear, whether self or provider-imposed and basis. Given impact, perceptions were explored in depth. Conducted in provinces with highest H prevalence, where tabos identified. Not explored in lower prevalence provinces. Follow-up after H no longer recommended by WHO. Non-participation compromises control objectives.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 45 villages of Al-Gedrisha locality, Eastern Sudan, to estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the area. Between May 5th and June 17, 2011, door-to-door interviews were conducted in 17,702 households with a population of 94,369 inhabitants. The crude mortality rate over 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people per day, and VL was a possible or probable cause for 19% of all deaths. The VL-specific rate was estimated at 0.9/100 per year. Medical teams examined 551 individuals with fever for at least two weeks, out of which 16 were diagnosed with primary VL. The incidence of VL over the past year was 7.0/100 persons per year, or 7.9/100 per year when deaths or possibly due to VL were included. 12.5% of the population reported a past VL episode. VL represents a significant burden in Eastern Sudan. Active case detection had a low yield in this setting with access to care, suggesting it may not be a priority for control in similar contexts.
Rates of Gyrase Supercoiling and Transcription Elongation Control Super Density in Bacterial Chromosome

Gyrase catalyzes negative supercoiling of DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction that condenses bacterial chromosomes into a compact nucleoid. The super density (σ) of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms: diffusible supercoil (σD) that moves freely around the chromosome in 10 kb domains, and constrained supercoil (σ) resulting from abundant proteins that bend, loop, or unwind DNA at sites. Diffible and constrained supercoils contribute equally to the in vivo super density of cells, σ=σ+σ. Unexpectedly, Escherichia coli has a 15% higher level of σ compared to Salmonella enterica. To decipher mechanisms that change diffible supercoil density of chromosomes, strains of Salmonella were analyzed using a 9 kb supercoil sensor inserted at positions around the genome. The sensor contains a lac operon flanked by resolvase binding sites and can monitor supercoil and transcription elongation in WT and mutant strains. RNA transcription caused supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess supercoiling was relaxed by Top I and gyrase replenished supercoil to maintain an equilibrium. Strains with gyrase mutations at permissive exhibited supercoil losses from 30% of levels to total σ at most locations. Coil were influenced by transcription addition rifampic (Rif) caused density to rebound throughout chromosome. Gyrase mutants caused supercoil also reduced elongation throughout genome. The link between polymerase elong speed and gyrase turnover suggests bacteria with growth may generate higher densities than slow species.

Three results show the density of Salmon DNA determined by mechanism links catalytic gyrase to elongation rate. TS of Gyr caused broad and depletion supercoil throughout genome. Effect was reversed by blocking transcription Rif. Most striking, gyr mutation caused fall to 1% while recombination 11 in upstream domain. Supercoil levels rose and fell opposite ends highly transcribed operon cells permissive. We measured chromosome levels and elongation using sensors at positions covering 6 domains. At 30 WT Salmon, elongates 45-60/sec different points genome, causing rotations 4-6 super/sec. Gyrase supercoils DNA 4-5/sec 30 (Rinsky and Higgins). Top removes super at single studies.
Researchers investigated the role of parasitophorous vacuole (PV) expansion in the intracellular growth of Leishmania amazonensis, a protozoan parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis. They found that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate the transcription of LYSTBeige, a protein previously shown to regulate lysosome size. Mutations in LYSTige caused PV expansion and enhanced L. amazon replication, while Lige overexpression led to small PV that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of Lige-expressing cells with vacolin reversed this phenotype, expanding PV and promoting growth. In contrast, E-64 reduced PV size in L-ige mutant cells and inhibited L amazon replication. Large PV appeared to protect parasites from oxidative damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on amazon viability within large PV, but enhanced growth within Lige-induced small PV. The study suggests that upregulation of Lige in infected cells functions as a host response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV size and inhibiting intracellular survival.
Researchers have developed a zebraf model of Allan-Her-Dandy syndrome (AH), a genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, and spastic paraplegia, and disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. The study aimed to determine the pathophysiological mechanisms of AH by generating a monocarboxyl transporter 8 (M8) mutant zraf using zinc-finger nuclease (Z)-mediated gene editing. Elimination of M8 decreased TH levels, but not expression of other TH-related genes. Similar to patients, M8/− larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies. High-throughput behavioral assays showed reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light and dark transitions, and increased sleep. These deficiencies were associated with altered myelin genes and neuron-specific circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging revealed reduced filopodia and axon branching in sensory neurons, decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. TH analogs restored myelin and axon growth in M/− larvae, suggesting M8 regulates neural assembly, mediating sensory and motor performance. Administration of TH analogs during development may reduce neurological damage in AH patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread virus that primarily affects newborns and immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. It infects various cell types using distinct entry pathways involving different forms of the g/g glycoprotein: g/gL/g, gL, and g/UL-131, as well as the fusion glycoprotein g. The minimal fusion machinery for cell-cell fusion is g/g and g. This study demonstrates that CMV g and g/g form a stable complex early after synthesis in the absence of other viral proteins. g/g can interact with g mutants unable to mediate cell fusion. g-g/g complexes make up to 16-50% of total g in CM virus particles. In contrast, small amounts of g/gL and g/UL-131 complexes are associated with g. Herpesviruses express g and g/g molecules, and most models suggest g/g interacts g to mediate fusion, although there is no direct evidence. For herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), it has been suggested that after binding g/g binds g either before or coincident with membrane fusion. This study's results have implications for these models, demonstrating CM g and g/g form stable g-g complexes are incorporated in virions without receptor or membrane.
Researchers have identified a nuclear-encoded gene, Gimap, which regulates the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in leukocytes, a type of white blood cells. The study used a heteroplasmic mouse model to demonstrate that Gimap, an outer membrane protein, influences the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues. Gimap is crucial for cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in regulating mtDNA variants and modulating mitochondrial diseases. The study found that mtDNA segregation in hematopoiet tissues is a complex trait regulated by age, independent of mt copy number, and that altered splicing of the CASTi allele changes the G3 protein sequence, but not the transmembrane domain, which localizes it to the outer membrane. G3 regulates mtDNA segregation in hematopoiet tissues, but its role in younger mice is unclear. The protein does not directly interact with mtDNA, as it does not span the membrane to facilitate interaction. Retroviral overexpression of G3 in embryonic fibroblasts had no effect on heterlas levels, implying a cell-specific pathway is required for mt segregation. Mitochondrial copy regulation has been proposed to influence mtDNA segregation and human mutations.
Researchers investigated the incubation period of Buruli (BU) caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans in Victoria, Australia, where the disease is geographically restricted and primarily affects residents of endemic areas. However, a significant proportion of cases are acquired by visitors to these regions. A previous study on the Bellarine peninsula estimated a mean incubation period of 4.5 months, but cases declined and a new endemic area emerged on the Mornington peninsula. A retrospective review of 443 cases between 2013-2016 identified 20 short-term visitors, with a mean incubation period of 143 days (4.8 months), similar to the previous estimate of 135 (4.5) days. Despite the shift in exposure location, no association was found between incubation period and age, sex, exposure duration, or location of lesion. The study confirms the incubation period of BU in Victoria to be 4-5 months, guiding clinicians and suggesting similar transmission modes in different regions. The estimate of 4.8 months (2-9) months for BU confirms a previous study from a different location, indicating similar transmission modes in Victorian regions.
Researchers have identified a protein in the Toxoplas parasite that is related to the human Niemann-Pick Type 1 protein (NPC), which plays a crucial role in cholesterol regulation and lipid trafficking. The protein, named TCR1, shares significant identity with human NPC and contains residues implicated in human disease. TCR localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the parasite's plasma membrane, unlike mammalian NPC, which localizes to endo-lysosomes. When expressed in mammalian NPC mutant cells, TCR restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from endo-lysosomes. Disrupting TCR in the parasite results in normal cholesterol levels but overaccumulation of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyins, and ceramides. The mutant parasites exhibit abundant lipid storage bodies and membranous tubules derived from parasitoph vacuoles. They replicate faster in vitro and are more virulent in mice than the parental strain. These findings suggest TCR's role in lipid homeostasis in Tooplas is to control intracellular lipid levels, leading to stimulation of lipid biosynthesis and division.
Ophthalmoacromelic syndrome (AS), also known as Waarden anophthalmia, is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bilateral anophthalmia and postaxial oligodactyly. Homozygosity mapping and targeted mutation analysis of locus 14q24 identified homozyg mutations in SMOC (SPARC-related calcium binding 1) in eight unrelated families. Four mutations are nonsense, frameshift, and missense, with missense mutations in the Thyrogulin-1 (T1) domain of the protein. The ortholog in mouse, Smoc, shows site and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofac, and somite development. A targeted preconditional gene-trap mutation of Smoc (Sm1tm1) reduces mRNA to 10% of wild-type levels, resulting in highly penetrant hindlim postax oligodactly in homozyg mutant (Sm1/t1) animals. Eye malformations, most coloma and cleft occur in a proportion of Sm1/t1/t1 embryos. Loss of Sm-1 results in a convincing phenocopy of the disease. SM-1 is a mammalian paralog of Drosoph Pentone, an inhibitor of decaplegic. The orth in Xenopus, Sm- also functions as BMP antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagon during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice.
Researchers have identified a protein called TRIM22 as a key mediator of the antiviral activity of Type 1 interferons against HIV replication. They used transcription profiling to identify genes induced by interferon treatment and found TR22 as one of the most upregulated genes. Overexpression of TR22 inhibited HIV replication, confirming previous studies. To assess the role of TR22 under natural conditions, they compared the effects of interferon in cells depleted of TR22 using RNAi and found HIV release was significantly increased in knockdown, indicating TR22 acts as an antiviral effector. Further studies showed TR22 inhibited budding of virus particles containing Gag, indicating G was the target of TR22. TR22 did not block release of ML or EIA G particles. Inhibition was associated with cytoplasmic staining of G rather than accumulation at the plasma membrane, suggesting TR22 disrupts trafficking. Mutational analyses of TR22 showed catalytic amino acids Cys and Cys of the R domain required TR22 antiral activity. The data disclose a pathway by which Type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication.
Researchers investigated the role of parasitic wasps in stabilizing the fig-pollinator mutualism, a symbiotic relationship between fig trees (Ficus) and their specific pollinators (Agonid wasps). In monoecious figs, pollinators oviposit into inner ovules, while avoiding outerules, suggesting a mechanism for mutual stability. However, the reason for this avoidance was unknown. The study found that in Ficus rubosa, outer ovules are vulnerable to parasitic wasps ovip from outside the sycon, with risk decreasing towards the center where innerules provide a safe space for pollinator offspring. This gradient in offspring viability likely selects pollinators to avoid outerules, forcing wasps to focus on a subset, reducing galling rates. This mechanism may contribute to mutualism persistence, independent of plant defenses against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints preventing ovip in all ovules. In most Ficus species, sycon receive foundresses exploit more ovules than produce wasps, leaving unexplained seed production. Three hypotheses failed to explain stability, suggesting key lies in pollin favoring innerules ovip. Variance in morphology and externally ovipiting parasitic wasps indicate potential for parasitic contribution to stability. The fig-poll mutualism is an obligate, with wasps pollinating trees and providing resources for offspring. Parasitic wasps may contribute to maintenance by selecting innerules due to reduced parasitism. The study shows pollin was gain fitness by selecting innerules due to reduced vulnerability.
Researchers conducted six controlled growth trials on an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to investigate the genetic and environmental factors influencing plant height. Non-destructive measurements enabled monitoring of plant height throughout the life cycle in both field and controlled environments revealed that height is reduced under water limitation and high planting density, and affected by growth environment (field vs. chamber). Results support a model where height is a heritable, polygenic trait, with major loci influencing height independent of environment. Genetic loci contributing to height change dynamically throughout development, and reduction in water limited environments is due to delayed progression of genetic program establishing height in Setaria. In this population, alleles from weedy S. viridis parent increase height, while domesticated S. italica parent alleles collectively increase height in later development. Combining field and controlled analysis with genetics dissected genetic and environmental components of height in Setaria. Genetic components determining height in R population exhibit strong canalization, but loci influenced by temporal and environmental factors. A chronological model of height may explain differences in parental lines grown in controlled versus field settings. Experiments in controlled settings before effects of alleles at positions 2 and 9 may not materialize due to growth constraints. Thirty-seven QTL associated with height development in Setaria R population were identified across twelve experiments varying water and density. Analysis suggests known Poaceae genes account for a fraction of loci.
A study was conducted in the Ncolia sub-region of the Pantanal, Brazil to investigate the circulation of flaviviruses, including Ilus virus (ILV), which was previously detected through serological evidence in horses. Between 2005 and 2009, at least three flaviviruses, including ILV, circulated in the Pantanal. Mosquitoes were collected from the same region in 2009 and 2010 and tested for infectious virus and flaviral RNA. A pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes aegypti tested positive for ILV by culture and real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. The full genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to the only available ILV genome. The study confirms IL circulation in the Pantanal. The region hosts diverse wildlife and hematophagous arthropods, favoring zoonotic arvirus circulation. Despite scarce data on arvirus vectors, local mosquito species reported as vectors have been found in north and south Pant. A 2009, flavirusurvey in equines detected past infection with increasing seroprevalence, Cipore virus, West virus, Louis encephalitis, and IL. The Pant is a seasonally flooded 140,000 km. The reported prevalence of IL in horses combined with IL isolation in mosquitoes confirms an arv of medical importance.
A preclinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose mectin (MO) as a new oral treatment for scabies compared to two-dose ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine model. Scabies is a common dermatological condition with a significant public health burden, and current treatments are insufficient due to emerging drug resistance. MO, with a more favorable pharmacological profile, may be a promising alternative. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive MO (0.3mg/kg once) or IV (0.2mg twice) or no treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S scabei Ig antibodies. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. At day 14 post-treatment, all MO-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IV-treated were. MO efficacy was 100% and unchanged until study-end (47), compared to 62% (26-100) for IV, with one IV-treated remaining infected until 47. Clinical scabies, pritus, and anti-Sabei Ig antibodies disappeared in all MO-treated but 75% IV-treated. MO persisted 9 times longer than IV in plasma and skin, enabling long-lasting efficacy. The study demonstrates single-d MO was more effective than consecutive IV, supporting MO as a therapeutic approach for scabies.
Researchers investigated the minimal peptoglycan (PG) synthesis machine in Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen known for its antibiotic resistance and hospital prevalence. They deleted seven of the nine genes encoding PG enzymes from the S. aureus genome, resulting in a strain capable of PG synthesis catalyzed by only two proteins, penicillin-binding protein (PBP1) and bi-functional BP2. However, this strain became highly susceptible to cell-wall targeting antibiotics and displayed impaired virulence in Drosophila infection, dependent on peptoglycan receptor PGRP-SA. The study shows that S. aureus can grow with two active PG synthesizing enzymes, indicating redundancy in vitro and identifies the minimal PG machinery of S. aureus. In clinically relevant environments, expend PG enzymes play a role in pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of S. aureus. The researchers constructed a S. aureus strain with minimal PG enzymes required for survival, targeting the final stages of synthesis for antibiotic development. Interactions between PG enzymes have been suggested, but not biochemically confirmed. A mutant S. aureus (MIN) was generated by deleting seven genes with PG activity. The study demonstrates the plasticity of PG process, with S. aure synthesizing PG using two proteins, BP1 and BP, performing transpeidation and transglyylation. The strain MIN was viable in rich and minimal medium, with deletion of seven genes having little effect on viability, growth, morphology, or PG in rich medium.
Burkholderia pseudalle is a saprophytic bacterium that can infect humans, causing meloidosis, a difficult-to-manage disease. Despite proper diagnosis and treatment, mortality rates range from 20% in Northern Australia to 40% in Thailand. Little is known about how B. pseudalle infects, invades, and survives within hosts, and the role of nutrients like iron in its pathogenesis. It was assumed B. pseudalle used iron-acquisition systems found in other bacteria, such as siderophores. However, a clinical isolate with a chromosomal deletion of the malleactin cluster, encoding its major-affinity siderore, was still virulent in a murine meloid model, suggesting other iron-acquisition systems contribute to virulence. This study deleted major siderore mactin (ba) and pyelin (p) clusters in strain 171b, revealing residual siderore activity unrelated to known Burkia siderores, not due to increased chelators like citrate. Deletion of hem uptake loci, hmu and hem, showed Hmu required for hem and hem utilization, and could not complement H deficiency. Prolong incubation of h hem mutant in hem-containing medium yielded variants able to utilize hem and hem, suggesting alternate pathways for these sources. Lacterrin was dependent on mact, not pyelin synthesis/uptake. A pchmu h hem quadruple could use ferritin as source and was lethal in acute murine meloid model. Data suggest B pseudalle may employ ferritin-iron pathway to sustain in vivo.
Researchers have developed a new tool called COMM (COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration) to improve the accuracy and usability of genome-scale constraint metabolic models (GSMs) by reconciling inconsistencies between multiple models of the same organism. These models are comprehensive representations of cellular function, integrating thousands of metabolites, reactions, and genes. However, their usability is often hindered by inconsistencies, particularly when combining multiple models. COMM automatically identifies and resolves these inconsistencies, creating a more accurate and comprehensive consensus model. Tests on four organisms showed that automatically generated models were predictive and increased knowledge representation coherence. This tool is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation does not scale, such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.

 Genome-scale metabolic models are both knowledge repositories and predictive models. A consensus model should be more comprehensive than individual models due to shared and unique parts, and accurate due to reconciliation of inconsistencies. COMM identifies similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of metabolic networks based on classification problems arising during integration and novel algorithms to resolve. Identifying similar reactions in different compartments is difficult, but an extension could progress this by combining metabolite information prior to matching. COMM bridges automation and high-quality manualuration for consensus generation.

Automatically generated models have higher predictive power than manually curated models and comparable to manually constructed models. COMM increases biological coherence while maintaining predictive power, crucial for usability and reliability to elucidate interactions.
Researchers investigated the role of cartilage matrix in regulating chondrocy maturation and perichond development in zebraf mutants. They isolated a class of mutants with decreased cartilage and increased perichral bone, and identified mutations in two genes, famb and xylosyltransferase1 (xt), which encode enzymes for proteoglycan synthesis. Mutants lacked wild-type levels of chroit sulfate, abundant in cartilage and perichral bone, and initiated perichral formation earlier than wild-type siblings. Primary chrocy defects may induce the phenotype secondarily because mutant chrotes initiated maturation, showing increased expression of markers such as run2, collagen 1a, andh coorths, andha suppressed perichral bone in mutants. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated aberrant matrix and cellular features of chro hypertrophy in mutants. Molecular and genetic studies showed chro Ih expression induced perichral in mutants. However, famb mutants exhibited perichral while loss of HG in chrotes. Data suggest defective cartilage synthesis alters transcription factors determining chro maturation, changing perichral timing. Mutations in famb and xyyl1 are associated with human diseases. Biochemical and histochemical analyses revealed CSP defects in mutants. Rescue experiments, expression, ultrastructural, and mutational analyses argue mutantrotes undergo precocious mat, inducing perichral. Findings are consistent with direct action inrotes producing mutant cartilage, indirectly causing elevated perral.
Researchers investigated the role of Topoisomerase II (Top) in the separation of heterochromatic regions during meiosis in Drosoph melanogaster females. They found that knockdown of Top II by RNA interference (RNAi) in later stages of meiosis resulted in defects in separation of heteroch regions after spindle assembly. Heteroch regions of achias and chias chromosomes failed to separate during prometaph I and metaph I, and were stretched into long projections with centromeres localizing near tips. Bipolar spindles formed in Top RNA-express oocytes, but achias chromosomes failed to move towards poles during promaph I. Bothias and chias chromosomes displayed defects in orientation. Euchromatic regions separated earlier in prophase, and no defects were observed in their separation upon Top knockdown at midphase. Embryos from Top RNA-express females failed to initiate mitotic divisions. The study suggests Topois II resolves heteroch DNA entang during meiosis, and these entang must be resolved to complete meiosis.
Researchers conducted a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars as a public health measure to prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CV) in a highly endemic area in Brazil. The study was conducted in two areas: an intervention area where seronegative dogs were collared and a control area with conventional CV control measures. Dogs were evaluated every 7-8 months for two years, with seropositive dogs removed and seronegative dogs included. In the first serological survey, seroprevalence was similar in both areas. At the second evaluation, significant reductions in serrevalence were seen in both areas, with 6.0% in the intervention and 11.0% in the control. The estimated relative risk (RR) indicated protection against CV in the intervention area. Although CV incidence did not differ, a tendency was observed in the control, possibly due to low seroconversion or loss to follow-up. Deltamethrin-impregnated collars likely provide protection over time in endemic areas, representing a challenge for local zoonosis control, indicating need for adjustments, including collar design.
Researchers investigated the notion that the mammalian X chromosome's gene content is biased due to limitations on gene expression caused by its haploid expression. They analyzed data from the Encyclopedia of DNA (ENCODE) and Functional Annotation of Mammalian Genome (FANT5) projects and found that human X-linked genes have lower maximal expression levels than autosomal genes, with an average expression three times lower on the X chromosome than autosomes. Autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. X-linked genes have a lesser increase in expression than autosomal ones compared to the human-chimpanzee ancestor, highly expressed but not lowly expressed. The "traffic jam" model explains the lower breadth of expression for genes on the X and Z chromosome, as broad expression is associated with high expression. Highly tissue-specific genes are rare on the X, and broadly expressed genes on X tend to be lowly expressed, indicating the trend is shaped by maximal expression not breadth. A limit to maximal expression explains biased tissue profiles of X-linked genes. Tissues with highly expressed genes (e.g., secretory, structural) are in which expression is rare on X. This trend cannot be accounted for by alternative models of biased expression. The notion that it's hard for genes on the X to be highly expressed due to transcription jams provides a rationale for features of X's content, expression, and evolution.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) in Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of Pygmies from Cameroon, and compared it to non-Baka agriculturalists. Gastric biopsies were obtained from 77 Baka and 101 non-B individuals and cultured for H. pyl. Unexpectedly, Baka showed a significantly lower H. pyl infection rate (20.8%) than non-B (80.2%). Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each H. pyl isolate, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified, with most assigned to hpAfrica or hp1. The hpAfrica population, associated with the Nilo-Saharan language expansion, was divided into East and West African subpopulations, and a new hp1 subpopulation, mainly among Cameroonians, supported eastern and western Bantu expansions. An age-structured model showed low H. pyl prevalence among Baka achievable in a few hundred years, suggesting demographic factors like small size and low life expectancy led to eradication. Baka were either H pyl-free or lost lineages during past fluctuations. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference showed B almost certainly acquired extant H pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors. H pyl prevalence was high in 178 Cameroonians, including 77 Baka and 101 non-B, with 46.8% Baka male and 21.8% non-B male. The population structure of H pyl infecting B and Pyies was unknown, with Bantu agriculturalists having high rates but unknown structure. H pyl from non-B of multiple ethnic groups was screened to quantify gene flow between hunter-gather and agriculturalists. H pyl from agricultural neighbors, acquired Bantu language, were tested in a genetic study of pyl infecting B, a subgroup of Western Pyies in Cameroon. B inhabit rainforests of Cameroon and Gabon, one of largest Py groups with 30-40,000 population.
Dengue virus NS5 (NS) is a highly conserved non-structural protein responsible for capping methylation and replication of the flavivirus genome, and interacts with host proteins to modulate immune responses. Although replication occurs in the cytoplasm, a characteristic of DENV2 NS is its localization to the nucleus with unclear role in replication or pathogenesis. This study examined NS of DENV1 and 2, which exhibit most difference in localization, employing combination of functional and structural analyses. Gene swapping between D1 and 2 NS identified the C-terminal 18 (C18) residues sufficient to direct protein to cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively. Low-mic affinity between NS C18 and importin-alpha (Imp) allowed complex purification and crystallization at 2.2 resolution. Structure-guided mutational analysis of this region in GFP-NS clones D1 or 2 and D2 infectious clone reveal residues for NS subcell localization. Notably, transformation by Pro884 allows Imp binding and mutating Pro to Thr, present in D1 NS, results mislocalization NS to cytoplasm without virus fitness. In contrast, mutation at R888, conserved in flaviruses, results in non-viable virus, and R mutation to severely attenuated phenotype, though NS in nucleus. R forms bond with Y conserved flavir. Data suggest conserved function C18, possibly RNA interactions critical replication, independent subcell localization.
Researchers have developed and field-tested an integrated mapping protocol for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) called the Integrated Threshold Mapping (IT) Methodology, which aims to determine whether a threshold for public health interventions has been reached in a given area. The protocol is designed to be resource-efficient and uses World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators for each disease in specific age groups. The study tested the protocol by comparing it to current WHO methodologies for each disease in one district in Mali and Senegal. Results showed that IT reached the same conclusions as WHO regarding initiation of public interventions for trach, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted recommendations for schistosiasis. IT was practical and demonstrated cost-effective compared to standard, non-integrated WHO methodologies. This integrated tool could facilitate implementation of programs in endemic countries.

The ITM methodology does not provide prevalence figures, its purpose is to determine if a disease has reached threshold for public intervention by balancing epidemiologic rigor and practicality. It is logistically practical, cost-efficient and flexible. For schosiasis, the approach results in more targeted MDAs compared to district implementation by integrated NTD programs. The protocol uses age-specific disease indicators as recommended by WHO.

The study shows a novel integrated protocol to determine thresholds for public health interventions. The approach is practical, cost-efficient and flexible. For schias, our approach results in more MDAs compared to district implementation by integrated NTD.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conserved phosphatase C14 is required for exit from mitosis and is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by the C1/Net protein until anaphase, at which time it is released into the nucleoplasm. Two poorly understood pathways promote C14 release: the FEAR (C fourteen early release network) and the MEN (mitotic network). Analysis of genetic interactions reveals a novel requirement for ubiquitination of histone H2 by the ubiquitin ligase Bre1 in cell-dependent release of C14 from nucleolar chrom when MEN is inactivated. This function of H2 ubiquination is mediated by activation of histone H methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (H3K4 and H3K79) but is not dependent on histone deacetylase (HD) Sir, which associates with C14 onolar chrom as part of the RENT complex. Additionally, a defect in C14 release is observed in cells lacking H3 lysine methylation (H3) and cells lacking HD recruited by this modification. These histone modifications represent unappreciated factors for accessibility and/or action onolar chrom of FEAR components.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, GeneProgram, to identify and characterize functional gene expression programs in human cells. Gene addresses challenges in analyzing large datasets, including cellular heterogeneity, genetic variation, and uncertainty in sample numbers and populations, and temporal behavior. Gene uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to organize tissues and genes into overlapping programs with consistent behavior, producing maps of expression sorted by generality scores. Using synthetic and real data, Gene outperformed popular analysis methods. Applied to a compend of 62 time-series expression datasets, Gene produced a map of 104 programs, many enriched for key pathways and NF-κB transcription factors. Gene discovered programs implicating surprising pathways, including Wnt and neurotransmitter receptors in response to infection. The map is expected to guide future experiments, with low generality genes as new targets and high generality maintaining physiological responses in disease. Gene is multipurpose and can be applied to novel data.
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the interferon-gamma (IFN) locus in NKGChi natural killer (NK) cells, a subset of innate immune cells that plays a crucial role in defense against CMV. Research showed that NKGChi NK cells in CMV seropositive individuals undergo epigen remodeling of the conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1) of the IF locus, similar to memory CD8+ T cells and TH1 cells. The accessibility of CNS1 enhances IF- transcription activity in response to NKG2 and 2B engagement, leading to IF- production in NKG NK cells. Epigen imprinting of the IF locus is a hallmark and crucial mechanism driving stable IF expression in CMV-specific NK expansions, providing a basis for regulation of adaptive features in innate cells. 

NKGChi NK cells in CM+ individuals display epigen remodeling of IF CNS, similar to cytok-primed NK cells, previously described as memory-like cells, and share CNS configuration with TH1 cells. CNS is an enhancer of IF transcription in TH cells, especially in response to TCR triggering. To analyze epigen regulation of IF locus contribution to IF competence and stability in memory-like NK, NKGChi and cytok-prim cells showed open configuration at IF CNS, acting as enhancer of IF transcription in response to NKG and activating receptors engagement. Epigen imprint in CNS of IF locus is a hallmark of adaptive features and IF- in NK cells. Epigen remodeling accompanies adaptive features, demonstrating inflammatory and pathogen induce epigen remodeling NK. This strengthens idea that epigen features are hallmarks of memory NK and T cells.
Legionella pneumophila exploits the host proteasome to temporally regulate the activity of its effector protein SidH by hijacking the host's ubiquitin-proteasome system through its effector protein LubX, which functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Lub specifically targets Sid for degradation, leading to its shutdown at later stages of infection. This represents a novel mechanism of temporal regulation of bacterial effectors, distinct from previously reported ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Salmonella effectors. Lub acts as a negative regulator of Sid within host cells, making it the first example of a bacterial effector that targets and regulates a cognate effector within the host, proposing the designation "metaeffector" for this class of effectors. The determinants of susceptibility are encoded in the effectors themselves, with Sid being intrinsically stable, while Lub controls Sid's instability by targeting it for ubiquination. Lub is a bona fide metaeff, regulating another effector's function within the host. Targets of bacterial E3 ligases are largely unknown, with previous studies focusing on host proteins; Sid is the first bacterial target of a bacterial E ligase effector. Future studies may reveal more bacterial effectors manipulating the ubiquitin system as metaeff coordinating effector functions spatiemporally. Lub's role at late stages of infection suggests it may target multiple host proteins, including Sid and Clk1, a previously reported substrate. Accumulating evidence suggests effectors functioning as E ubiquitinases are prevalent among plant and animal pathogens.
This study investigated the diversification of HIV-1 env sequences in 81 early subtype B infections, where the infecting virus could be accurately estimated, allowing for inference of substitution and insertion/deletion events. By integrating data from multiple acutely infected hosts, evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env was found, with 24 codons diversifying more rapidly than expected under a neutral model. Of these, 14 were in CTL epitopes verified or predicted by individual HLA or nucleotide context indicative of APOB-mediated G-to-A substitutions, suggesting APOEC may facilitate early escape. Rapidly diversifying sites not explained by CTL or APOEC hypermutation included the most mutated site in gp41. Insertions and deletions in hyperviable regions of the envelope glycoprotein were due to selection, not mutational hotspots. The study provides a detailed view of HIV-1 diversification following transmission, highlighting CTL and hypermutation's role in shaping evolution during new infections.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study epigenetic silencing in yeast, focusing on molecular interactions between histone modifications and proteins. The model identifies essential epigenetic marks for bistability, incorporating two key chromatin marks: H4 acetylation and H3 methylation. The presence of multiple marks leads to qualitatively different behavior, with both modifications being crucial for robust epigen silencing. The model predicts a novel bivalent state, where chromatin is both active and silenced under certain perturbations, such as knock-out mutations or enzymatic inhibition. This bivalent state is stable under perturbations and results in patch silencing. Additionally, limited supply of silencing proteins can lead to counterintuitive responses. The study investigates the design of the silencing system and assesses experimental observations within a theoretical framework, discussing protein recruitment, spreading, and stability of silenced regions in mutants like Sas2 and Dot1. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, informing which are essential for epigen fate and reinforcing one over another.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the differences in gut microbiota (GM) composition between Ugandan children hospitalized with oedematous and non-oedemat severe acute malnutrition (SAM). A total of 87 children aged 6-24 months were included, with 62% suffering from oedemat malnutrition and 66% being boys with a mean age of 16.1 months. Fecal samples were collected at admission and analyzed using Denaturing Gradient Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA-targeted high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that non-oemat children had lower GM diversity compared to oemat children, but no compositional differences were identified between the two groups. Alpha diversity was determined by DG (p=0.031) and high-throughput sequencing (p=0.036). Beta diversity analysis did not reveal differences between GM of children with oemat and nonemat SAM (ANOS, weighted UniFrac R=-0.008, p=0.584; unweighted UniF R=0.071, p=0.011). The study suggests that nonemat SAM children have lower GM diversity than oemat children, but no clear compositional differences were found. This is consistent with previous studies linking GM to malnutrition, showing pathogenic bacteria in malnour children compared to healthy controls. A direct relationship between mal and GM was demonstrated by transplanting fecal samples from Malian twins discordant for oemat mal, kwashiork, into germ-free mice. However, it remains unknown whether GM differs between oemat and nonemat SAM. The findings justify further research on therapeutic strategies for SAM in developing countries, where mal remains a major problem, accounting for 12.6% of deaths in children under 5 years.
Researchers investigated telomere length variation in 112 wild-type Saccharomy sensu stricto isolates, finding extensive variation in S paradox isolates. Telom length correlated with geographic origin, with European strains having short telomeres (<150bp) and American isolates having telom approximately three times longer (>400bp). Insertion of URA gene near telom allowed analysis of individual telom lengths and telom position (TPE). Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telom lengths consistent with multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) involvement. Variation in TPE was weakly correlated with telom length. Genotyping F1 segregants indicated several QTL associated with telom length and silencing variation, including candidate genes and regions without known telom properties. Transgressive segregation was detected for both phenotypes, validated by reciprocal hemizygosity that YU and TLC are telom-length QTL in S paradox subpopulations. Sequence divergence within Ku generated negative epistasis in allelic combinations (American-YU and European-YU) resulting in short telom.
Researchers investigated the cognitive and neural processes underlying human decision-making by examining when and how people choose, rather than just what they choose. Traditional sequential sampling models (SSMs) assume decisions emerge from a bounded accumulation process, making response times (RTs) predictable. However, these models fail when people are not forced to respond immediately but allowed to sample information sequentially, as the decision-maker may delay choice and terminate the process, a scenario not accounted for by standard SS. The study developed SSs predicting RTs from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and free to respond at any time. Standard SS did not adequately describe RT distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model obtained an accurate fit. Time-frequency EEG analysis revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-frequencies (14-30Hz), indicating responses prepared and inhibited, supporting a decision to not decide. The extended model accounted for results of an adapted paradigm where participants pressed a button for sampling information. Results show computational modeling decisions and RT support understanding hidden cognition dynamics.
Researchers identified a genetic mutation in the SUVH2 gene as the cause of hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers, a condition characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 13 HN cases and 23 controls revealed a strong association on chromosome 2. Resequencing of one case's genome detected a non-synonymous variant in the SUVH gene, a histone lysine 9 (H3) methyltransferase, which mediates chromatin silencing. The variant c.972G>T is predicted to change a conserved asparagine to lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme. Histopathological analysis of the epidermis in vivo suggests HN is not caused by hyperproliferation but delayed differentiation of kerocytes. SUVH is involved in epetic regulation of kerocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and sealing of mammalian epidermis.
Researchers investigated the emergence of transmissible reassortant viruses during co-infection of avian and swine influenza A viruses in swine. Genomic analysis of 571 isolates from nasal samples and respiratory tissues of co-housed pigs (influenza-negative, avian H1N1 IAV-infected and swine H3N2 IAV-infected) identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortant viruses. Viruses from lower respiratory tissues had the largest diversity, while those from turbinate and nasal fluids had the least. Reassants from lower tracts had the largest variations in growth in respiratory epithelial cells, and temperature in sw nasal cells selected the type of reassant shed by pigs. One reassant in nasal samples was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower tract, and was efficiently transmitted between pigs. The study suggests that during mixed infections of av and sw IAV, reassortments likely occur in lower tracts and tissue tropism is a factor for selecting transmissible reassant.
A study investigated the effect of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and prazantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistoma mans infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five. Offspring of Schistoma-infected women in endemic areas may be sensitized in utero, which may influence their immune responsiveness to Schoma infection and associated morbidity. The study examined the effects of prazant treatment of S mans during pregnancy on the risk of S infection among offspring and their immune responses when exposed to S. In a trial, offspring of women treated with prazant or placebo during pregnancy were examined for S infection and cytokine and antibody responses to SW and SEA, as well as T cell expression FoxP at five. Of 134 children, 2.4% had S infection at five years based on single sample. Infection did not differ between treated or untreated. Cytokine IF, IL, IL, and IL and antibody Ig, Ig and Ig responses SW and FoxP were higher among infected than uninfected. Prazant treatment S during pregnancy had no effect on responses, exception IL to SW which was higher offspring women received prazant than did not. No evidence found maternal S and treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence or intensity S infection or immune response among at five, but observed on SW suggest maternal and treatment may affect immunoreg responsiveness in schosomias.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which macrophages reprogram their endocytic machinery in response to inflammatory stimuli, switching from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macinocytosis. This allows for the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. The key molecular switch for this reprogramming is the phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which activates phosphoinositol (PI)-3-kinase activity necessary for macinocytic uptake. Expression of a phosphomim form of coron 1 is sufficient to induce PI-3kin activation and macinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. This suggests a previously unknown mechanism for regulating internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation. Macrophages activated by inflammatory stimuli undergo serine phosphorylation of coronin 1, reprogramming them from phagytic to macinocytic mode. Expression of a phosphim coron 1 mutant resulted in mycobacteria being transferred to lysosomes for elimination, regardless of macroph activation state. In the absence of inflammatory stimuli, coron 1 phosphorylation is sufficient to redirect phytic cargo via macinocyt to lysosomes. Macrophages expressing a phosphim glutamic acid mutant of coron 1 internalized Ig-coated beads through macinocyt in absence interferon. Phosphorylation of coron 1 is crucial for switch from phag to macin uptake upon macro activation.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in Arua District, North Uganda to assess community acceptance of tset baits (insecticide-treated targets) in areas where they had not been previously used. The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across the district. Results showed that villagers who had never seen baits before expressed fear and anxiety, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river" linked to illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers in areas where ba had been used previously had positive attitudes and were aware of their purpose and benefits. The latter group reported similar negative perceptions when tse control started a decade ago. Acceptance of ba varies between villages, related to duration of experience with tse programs. Success of community-based interventions against tse depends on engagement and sensitization campaigns reaching all communities, especially new areas. A previous study in DRC showed negative attitudes led to damage and failure. Community acceptance is vital for effective tse control. The study was conducted in an area of West, North Uganda, where ba used in government programs against Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Efforts enhance community participation in ba range from encouraging to active construction and maintenance. In all studies, acceptance was crucial for success. Three years before, 70 ba were deployed per parish, but not monitored, resulting in unsustainable tse control. Deployment enabled communities to familiarize themselves with ba. Sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei, transmitted by tse, is restricted to Africa, causing chronic form in West and Central, including the study area. Tse vectors other species pathogenic to livestock, estimated losses. In H villages, no previous tse programs, first exposure to ba was introduced. Eight villages included, four H+ and four H−, shown in Figure 1.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive study on the recombination landscapes in Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fruit fly, to understand the fundamental biological process of recombination and its impact on evolution. They analyzed 5,860 meioses and genotyped 139 million SNPs, mapping 106,964 recombination events at a resolution of 2 kilobases. This allowed for the creation of whole-genome maps of crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC) recombination, as well as detailed variation in recombination among individuals. The study found extreme and punctuated variation in CO rates along chromosomes, with hotspots and coldspots, and intra-specific variation associated with hotspots at low frequency. Gene conversion rates were uniformly distributed across the genome, detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. Local recombination events were associated with sequence motifs, occurring within transcript regions, suggesting chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. The study highlights the importance of accounting for recombination variation in population models of selection and linkage.
Researchers have identified ID2 (ID2) as a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thalian, but its function in RDM remained unknown. By purifying ID2, they co-purified two ID paralogs, ID1 and ID2 (ID2PAR1 and 2). The coiled domain between the XS and X domains of ID2 is essential for ID homodimerization, whereas the ID2-terminal X domain, not coiled domain, is required for ID interaction with ID1 and ID2. Introducing wild-type ID2 and its derivatives into the id2 mutant demonstrated that the uncharacterized ID X domain is required for ID-ID1/ID2 formation and function. ID1 is required for de novo methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional silencing, while ID2 has partially overlapping roles with ID1. Unlike ID2, ID1 and ID2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA, suggesting roles of ID1 and ID2 are different from ID in ID-ID/ID complex and ID1 and ID2 are essential for functioning of RDM.
Exposure to Leishmania braziliensis triggers neutrophil activation and apoptosis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against pathogens and are rapidly recruited to sites of Leishmanial inoculation. During Leish braziliensis infection, depletion of neutrophils significantly increases parasite load, whereas co-culture of neutils with L braziliensis has an opposite effect. Co-culture of infected macrophages and neutils induced parasite killing, leading to investigate neutil response to L brazili. This study focused on interaction between neutils and Lili, exploring activation and apoptotic fate. Inoculation of serum-opsonized Lili promastigotes mice neutil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro exposure of thioglyateelic inflammatory bone neutils to Lili modulated expression of surface molecules CD18 and CD62, and induced oxidative burst. Using mCh-expressing Lili, effects were mainly observed in infected and bystander cells. Neutil activation with Lili was confirmed by release of TN-α and neutilase. Neutils with Lili displayed markers of early apoptosis. Lili induces neutil recruitment in vivo and neutils exposed to parasite in vitro through activation and release of inflammatory mediators, impacting parasite elimination at early stages.
Researchers investigated the potential benefits of vaccination as a supplementary control measure for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle. Currently, vaccination is not used in international control programs and is prohibited in the EU. Candidate vaccines based on Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmet-Guerin (BCG) interfere with the tuberculin skin test, used to determine if herds and countries are officially TB-free. New diagnostic tests, Differentiated Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIV), offer the potential to introduce vaccination within eradication programs. The study used within-herd models from historical data from Great Britain (GB) to explore the feasibility of supplemental use. The economic impact of bovine tuberculosis on farmers is dominated by costs associated with testing and restrictions on animal movements. Farmers' willingness to adopt vaccination requires not only reducing the burden of infection but also the risk of restrictions imposed. The study found that under intensive testing in GB, the specificity of DIV test rather than sensitivity is the greatest barrier to herd benefit vaccination. The negative effects of vaccination could be mitigated through testing relaxation, potentially increasing hidden infection in officially free herds. The models explored the range of DIV characteristics necessary for a protective benefit. Estimated a DIV specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity >40% required a benefit with no increase in risk. Data from experimentally infected animals suggest this specificity could be achieved using a cocktail of DIV antigens while maintaining sensitivity 73.3% (95%:61.9, 82.9) relative post-mortem detection.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds called dihydrobenz[e][1,4]azin-2(3)-ones that show anthelmint activity against the parasitic worm Trichis, which infects over 500 million people worldwide, causing physical and educational damage. The compounds were discovered through screening a library of 480 small molecules on Trichis mur, a model for T. trichi, and were found to paralyze adult parasites in vitro. Further screening and synthesis led to 20 active dihydrozazepones, a new class not previously implicated in nematode control. The most potent compounds had EC50 values around 25-50μM, comparable to existing anthelmint levamis, and showed low cytotoxicity against murine epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. The compounds also reduced embryon T. mur eggs ability to establish infection in vivo, suggesting a potential for a therapeutic that acts in the environment, such as a spray, to interrupt the lifecycle. These results show dihydroazepones are a new anthint active against both egg and adult stages of Trich parasites, with considerable scope for optimisation to improve potency and pharmacetic properties.
Researchers revisited the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks, where "date" hubs have low co-expression with partners and "party" hubs have high co-expression. They found that the importance of "date" hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of extremely central hubs, which do not display low correlation, undermining the idea of a link between quantity and function. The "date/party distinction was motivated by an approximately bimodal distribution of hub-expression, but this feature is not robust to methodological changes. Topological properties of hubs do not correlate with co-expression, but there is a significant correlation between centrality and functional similarity of interacting proteins. The authors suggest conceiving roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins is more useful. They examined the division of hubs into "date" and "party categories from different angles, demonstrating prior arguments are susceptible to data and method changes. Observed differences in network vulnerability arise from small important hubs. Properties attributed to "date and "party do not correspond with actual topological roles, which are more diverse than explained by a dichotomy. The authors analyzed modular organisation and roles of hubs in interaction, revisiting the possibility of "date/party dichotomy and found concerns. Claims of bimality in hub distributions do not appear robust, and deletion tests have not considered outlier effects.
Researchers have developed methods to reconstruct transmission trees of infectious disease outbreaks from whole genome sequences, but a limitation is the requirement for genetic diversity to occur on epidemiological timescales. This means that the position of individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between pathogen genomes. To compare genetic diversity in different outbreaks, the concept of "transmission" is introduced, defined as the number of mutations separating genome sequences from transmission pairs. Using literature values, scenarios are simulated with two evolution models to describe transmission of major pathogens. Results show that mean transmission varies between pathogens, but is generally low, with many outbreaks having genetically identical pairs. The impact of transmission on reconstructing outbreaks is demonstrated using tools R and phy, showing that rapidly evolving pathogens like viruses provide information on individual events, while pathogens like Streptoccus, Shella, and Clostrid provide little to no information. This highlights limitations of genetic data in certain scenarios and the need to expand tools to integrate other epidemiological data.
Researchers investigated the phenomenon of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals, where one X chromosome is silenced, but some genes escape this process. They analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed CI using single nucleotide polymorphisms. A binomial model assessed allelic expression, demonstrating a continuum between silencing and expression from the inactive X (Xi). RNA-seq was verified with RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing, identifying common escape and tissue-specific genes. Few genes (3-7%) escape CI in mouse tissues, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro embryonic kidney-derived Pki cell line showed 21% escape, representing kidney-specific and cell-line escape. Alle-specific RNA polymerase II and DNase hypersensitivity at Xi promoters correlated with escape, indicating open chromatin structure. CTCF binding on Xi was denser in brain compared to Pki line, contributing to compartmentalized Xi and fewer escape in brain.

A new algorithm calculated bi-allelic versus monoallelic expression probability, identifying genes expressed from both X chromosomes in mouse tissues. Only a minority escape CI in tissue and cell-specific manner, indicating CI and escape are tightly controlled in vivo. Surveys in human/mouse cells showed 8-15% consistently escape, 10-13 variable, and 10-20 varying between lines/individuals. Escape results in sexual dimorphisms and bi-alle expression is important for normal female phenotype. Mouse 3-7 escape may differ from other mammals. Pki cells showed more escape than tissues, possibly epigenetic changes or cell property.

Escape genes distributed along X, distance from XIC did not influence Xi expression. Important genes regulate transcription and translation, dosage-sensitive, consistently escaping CI. Tissue-specific genes help understanding sex differences.
Researchers have identified and characterized a novel cyste protease, VX-4, from the malaria parasite Plasium viv, which plays a crucial role in the parasite's survival and egress from the erythrocyte. VX-4 has dual substrate specificity depending on the microenvironmental pH, with highest activity against benzyycarbonyl-Le-Arg-methyl-amide at acidic pH 5.5 and against Z-Arg-M at neutral pH 6.5-7.5. It prefers positively charged amino acids at the P1 position, with less specificity at P3 and P4, which depends on pH. Three amino acids in the S pocket were substituted in VX-4 compared to VX-2 and VX-3. Replacement of Glu180 abolished activity against Z-Arg-M at neutral pH, indicating its importance in pH-dependent preference. VX-4 is localized in the vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. viv, with maximal activity against actin at neutral pH, and against P. viv plasm and hemoglobin at neutral/acidic and acidic pH, respectively. VX- demonstrates pH-dependent switching, allowing for efficient cleavage of different substrates in intracellular environments. It might function as hemase in acidic foodu, matur of P. viv plasm at neutral/acid, and cytos-degrading in erythrocytos. The study contributes to understanding of P viv cystine proteases and potential targets for antimal drugs.
Researchers have developed a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME) for the acetogen Clostridium ljungahli to gain insights into its biology and improve biotechnological production. The model, named iL965ME, captures major metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary for catalyzing reactions, broadening predictability. It reveals how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy in acetogens and accurately predicts secretion of multiple fermentation products. Predicting overflow metabolism enables new strategies, such as glycerol production, a novel product for C. ljungahli, expanding its metabolic capability. The model also predicts changing secretion rates based on metal availability, opening fermentation optimization and knowledge about proteome and carbon flux in acetogens. 

The iLME includes all central metabolic, amino, acid, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary for catalyzing reactions. It also includes WLP with cofactors and mechanisms for energy conservation. Metabolic and expression models represent cellular processes like macrom synthesis and transcription, broadening predictability. RNA and protein abundances are explicitly predicted, allowing cofactor exploration. The model accurately predicts acetate, ethanol, and glycer secretion during carbon and metal availability, revealing protein and media influence on pathways and energy in acetogen.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a panel of human osteoblast (HO) cells to investigate the genetic control of transcript variation in disease-relevant signals. They performed a transcriptomic survey similar to recent studies in lymphoblast cell lines (LCL) and found distinct cell-type genes and functionally relevant pathways unique to each tissue. Cis-association analysis with SNP genotypes identified genetic variations in transcript forms, indicating differential expression in HO is partly controlled by cis-regulatory variants. These forms are regulated by variants in tissue-specific and tissue-independent manners, confirmed by RT-PCR validation. The study suggests multiple isoforms are present in both tissues and genetic may affect relative expression of one to another, rather than an all-or effect. Examination of top SNPs from GWAS of bone density showed overlap with associations in this study, corresponding to the FAM gene tested in additional clinical studies revealing a novel isoform. The approach examining transcript variation in multiple types is useful for detecting variation common to cell types and identifying cell-specific variants functionally relevant for follow-up GWAS.
Researchers studied the yeast Saccharomyces eayan, a non-cerevisiae parent of the lager-brew hybrid Sorian, to understand why it cannot utilize maltotose, a major carbohydrate in brew's wort. Unlike most evis andorian strains, eayan lacks maltotose transporter genes. However, it has four SeALT genes for α-glucide maltose uptake. The team created maltose-assimulating mutants and evolved them in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltose fermentation in 7 ferment experiments on industrial w. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel SeALT gene, resulting from introgression of three SeALT genes. The predicted structure SeALT is similar to original transporters, but overexpression sufficed to enable growth on maltose. This suggests neofunctionalization occurred. The structure resembles Sorian maltose-transporter SpY, with high identity to evis MAL1, us MAL, and e SeALT. Evolution of maltose landscape in hybridorian lagerrew strains likely involved similar mechanisms.
Researchers have established a correlation between the mortality caused by influenza virus strains and their antigenic variation, enabling the development of a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N) virus by predicting antigenic distance between A(H1) strains. A simplified host-virus model was proposed to explore the relationship between antigen variation and excess mortality, revealing a direct and positive correlation. The study aimed to address the challenge of timely and accurate assessment of influenza impact on human death, as current approaches rely on intensive and biased surveillance. The model considers strains of distinct antigen causing significant infection in the population, denoted as "antigen strains". A method, EAD, was developed to predict antigen distance with high accuracy, suggesting utility in rapid estimation of mortality. EAD distance of (H1) was evaluated and found to correlate with observed mortality. The method is proposed to be useful for rapid assessment of mortality of future (1) variants and applicable to antigen variants of (3) and (B) with modification.
Researchers have identified a small cysteine-rich protein, PEC23, from the Asian soybean fungus Phakora pachyri, that suppresses plant immunity. P. pachyri is an obligate biotrophic pathogen causing severe soybean epidemics, and its interaction mechanisms with host plants are poorly understood. Genomes of rust fungi encode many secreted cystine-rich proteins (SCRPs), but their roles are unknown. PEC23 interacts with soybean transcription factor GPL12, silencing GPL12 leads to constitutive immunity, identifying GPL12 as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Data show PEC suppresses soy immune responses and physically interacts with GPL12, a negative regulator. PEC is a virulence factor. Pachri infection assays on GPL12-silenced and PEC-silenced soybeans showed no change in disease phenotypes, possibly due to redundancy of pach effector proteins. GPL acts as an immune suppressor ensuring normal growth in absence of infection.
Researchers have identified EphA2, a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor, as a receptor for Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium that invades host cells to replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. Chydia induces a lasting activation of the PI kinase pathway required for efficient replication. Interfering with C trachar2 binding to Eph2, downregulation of Eph2 or inhibition of Eph2 activity significantly reduced infection. C interacts with and activates Eph2 on the surface, resulting in receptor internalization. During chyd replication, Eph2 remains active around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 subunit of PIK to activate the PI/Akt pathway required for chyd development. Overexpression of full-length Eph2, but not mutant lacking the intracellular domain, enhanced PI activation and infection. Despite depletion of Eph2 from the surface, C induces upregulation of Eph through activation of the ER pathway, keeping infected cells in an apoptosis-resistant state. Engagement of a surface receptor at the membrane is a new mechanism Chy subverts host and induces resistance.
Researchers have investigated the role of active dendrites in neuronal computation, specifically their excitability through voltage-gated ion channels. Despite past efforts, the function of dendritic excitability remained unclear. A model of an active dendritic tree shows that its output is a highly non-linear function of afferent rate, achieving large dynamic ranges (up to 50 dB). The model replicates double-sigmoid responses observed in retinal ganglion cells. The study proposes that dendritic enhancement of dynamic range is its primary role. Neurons with larger dendritic trees are predicted to have larger dynamic range, and blocking active conductances lead to decreased dynamic.

The research aims to examine dendrites as a site for computation, given their ion channels supporting non-linear summation and dendritic spikes. However, spikes are a consequence of excitable dynamics. Dendritic trees without plasticity can benefit from active dendrites for enlarged operational range. Neurons have extensive dendritic trees, with morph and dynamic aspects studied. Dendritic conductances were discovered.

The proposal is that large dendrites amplify weak signals and saturate strong activity. The "dynamic range" trade-off between sensitivity and saturation is crucial for neurons, networks, organs, and organisms. Results suggest dendritic spikes under synaptic bombardment are responsible for a model prediction: the transfer function is not Hill-like, but double-sigmoid, observed in retinal ganglion cells.
Researchers investigated the inference of quantitative models of bacterial promoters from time-series gene data, a crucial for drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. Current methods assume mRNA abundance represents protein concentrations and changes in gene expression are solely due to transcription factors, neglecting global effects. They measured in vivo activity of E. coli's FliFliM module, estimating protein concentrations and global effects using kinetic models. Results show correcting these assumptions improves model quality, especially for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying expression machinery activity. The study proposes using time-series data to learn regulatory network structure and dynamics, demonstrating global effects and regulation importance for Fli and FlM halfives in Fli-dependent promoters. 

A new approach for transcriptome experiments uses constitutively-expressed genes and models to reconstruct protein concentrations and integrate physiological effects into inference. Measuring global effects with a reporter driven constitutive promoter only marginally improves model fit. Estimating Fli and FlM concentrations from promoter activities and physiologically halfives yields a rich dataset for testing mRNA and protein influences on inference. The study infers regulatory and quantitative function of Fli-dependent gene, not regulated by other factors, using reconstructed concentrations and kinetic models.
Researchers conducted a study in the Agua region of Panama to investigate the spatial-temporal distribution of Oligyomys fulcens, a rodent species that serves as a reservoir for zoonotic pathogens. They analyzed data from a longitudinal study of rodent populations collected between April 2006 and December 2009, using non-spatial analyses and spatial statistical tests. The study area was divided into a 90-node grid with a total area of 6.43 km2, and the temporal dataset was divided into four periods: dry season, rainy season, and two transitional months between seasons. Results showed heterogeneous patterns in population densities and dispersion of O. fulcens across seasons and years, with the species typically absent during late transitional months and re-established in subsequent years. Spatial autocorrelation analysis indicated local populations encompassed approximately 300-600m, with suitable and unsuitable habitats sharply demarcated over short distances. O. fulens showed a well-defined spatial pattern over time, leading to shifting hotspots of abundance that explain intermittent risk transmission by this species. Variation was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures from agricultural activities. These factors define occurrence, timing, intensity, and duration of synanthropic populations affected by human populations, and possible exposure to local populations.
Researchers have developed a computational method to infer the antigenic relationships between amino acid changes in the hemagglutinin protein of human influenza A (H3) viruses from 1968 to 2003. The technique, based on least-squares optimization, fits pairwise antigen distances between isolates onto an evolutionary tree, allowing for a fine-grained resolution of the antigen impact of individual changes without time and cost-intensive experiments. The method was applied to infer antigen trees representing the antigen evolution of the major protein over 35 years, with branch lengths representing antigen distances inferred from HI assay data and maximum likelihood of the HA domain. The results were comparable to antigen cartography and identified both known and novel amino acid changes with antigen impact. The technique can be applied to infer phenotype and genotype-phenotype relationships in other types of pairwise distances.
Researchers conducted a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to identify host factors required for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection. The study revealed a cluster of mitotic genes essential for viral DNA import into the nucleus. In interphase cells, viruses were endocytosed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but vDNA failed to be imported into the nucleus. However, upon nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis, HPV16 infection occurred. During mitosis, vDNA associated with host chromatin on the metaphase plate. The researchers propose that HPV requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for vDNA access to the nucleoplasm. The study highlights the value of RNAi screens in investigating viral infections and provides a list of cell functions required for HPV16 infection, a resource for future virus-host interaction studies.

The study found that mitosis is crucial for HPV16 nuclear DNA import, facilitated by nuclear envelope permeability changes due to breakdown. Nuclear envelope breakdown allows subviral complex association with host chromatin on metaphase. The researchers used RNAi screens to analyze pathogen-host interactions and focused on genes suppressing HPV16 infectivity, uncovering a role for mitosis in HPV entry. The vDNA of HPV16 enters the nucleopl by possibly relying on nuclear breakdown, which removes the nucleo-cytoplasmic barrier during mitosis. The nuclear envelope disassembles during G/M transition and reassembles during telophase before cytokinesis. Certain retroviruses use this window to access the nucleopl.

HPV16 addition does not promote cell division but increases cells in prolonged mitosis, dependent on L associating with host chromatin, a mechanism for v import into nuclei. After penetration, v moves with L into nucleus and localizes to ND domains. Nuclear import of subiral complex is unknown. HPV entry requires progression into early mitosis, unclear which step influenced by cell cycle.
Black Sigat or black streak disease, caused by the Dothideomyc fungus Pseudocospora fiji (formerly Mycosphaella fiji), is a significant foliar disease of banana worldwide. Due to the lack of effective resistance, management requires frequent fungicide applications, increasing economic and environmental costs in banana production. Two strains of P. fiji were sequenced and assembled with a new genetic map. The 74Mb genome of P. fiji is expanded by LTR transposons, the largest in Dothideomyc. Electrophoretic karyotyping and molecular markers of P. fiji populations showed chromosome polymorphisms and genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting selection and limited gene flow at geographic scale. Frequencies of fungicide in treated plantations were higher than untreated P. fiji populations. A homologue of Cladospor fulum Avr effector, PfAv4, was identified in P. fiji genome. Infiltration of purified PfAV4 into leaves of resistant variety Calcut 4 resulted in hypersensitive response, suggesting Cal 4 carries unknown gene recognizing Pf4. The P. fiji genome will aid in fungicide treatment and banana breeding programs.
Researchers have developed a novel framework to study the evolution of lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites without relying on detailed cross-species alignments. This approach, called the "birth-death model," estimates the rate of creation of new binding sites along a specific lineage, allowing for the identification of novel regulatory elements contributing to species-specific traits. The method was applied to six transcription factors (GATA, SOX, CTC, MY, MAX, E1, and TS) in the human-mouse lineage, revealing that 58-79% of binding sites in humans originated since divergence. Over 15% of binding sites are unique to hominids, often near genes associated with specific pathways and harboring more SNPs than older sites in the genome. This supports the method's ability to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and understand their role in gene regulation variation across species. In contrast to conservation-based approaches, this method generates predictions using lineage-specific sites or their increased rate of creation. Five of six factors produced the most significant motif prediction using this method. The method was applied to ChIP-seq data for six TFs, chosen for their diverse functions, well-documented motifs, and availability in human and mouse cell types. It determines lineage differences in evolutionary rates of a motif along a branch in the phylogeny. Despite divergence of protein-binding across species, computational models have focused on "phylogen footprinting" approaches, identifying elements by conservation. Results support this method's ability to identify lineage regulatory elements, a step towards understanding regulatory evolution's role in gene variation across species.
Researchers investigated the mechanism by which light regulates the expression of the zebraf period2 (per) gene, a key component of the vertebrate circadian clock. They identified a Light-Responsive Module (LRM) within the per promoter, which is necessary and sufficient for light-driven expression and circadian regulation. The LRM is conserved in vertebrate per genes, even in species lacking light-sensitive peripheral clocks, and can substitute for the zraf LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zraf cells. The LRM contains E-box and D-box elements, critical for its function. The E-box mediates circadian regulation by BMAL1/CLOCK activity, while the D-box directs light-driven expression. The zraf homolog of thyroid embryonic factor binds to the L D-box and transactivates expression. Knockdown of this factor attenuates light-driven transcription from the per promoter in vivo. Results support a model where light-dependent crosstalk between E and D-box factors is central to per expression.
Researchers have investigated the role of the actin-binding protein coronin in the motility of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. They found that coronin regulates motility and is essential for efficient transmission from mosquitoes to mice, as parasites lacking coron show defects in salivary gland invasion but not skin migration. Coronin localizes to the periphery of sporites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and contributes to motility through actin-binding. Mutations and imaging suggest coron organizes actin filaments for motility. Using coronin-mCherry as a marker for actin filaments, protein A was found to contribute to actin disassembly. Calcium and cAMP signaling regulate a switch from motility to host invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics. Extracellular ligands trigger intracellular calcium release followed by actin formation and coronin relocalization to the rear of the gliding sporite. Parasites lacking coron frequently detach from substrate and struggle to reattach, suggesting a function in adhesion. Actin filaments are short in Plmod and related parasites, making it speculative how they are organized. Data suggest interplay between TR-family adhesins, act filaments, and regulating adhesion for sporite migration.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism of resistance to amphotin B, a key treatment for leishmaniasis, in four Leishmania mexicana lines. These lines exhibited altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Genome sequencing revealed a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol5-desaturase in one line, while RNA-seq showed loss of expression of sterol24-ethyltransferase (SMT) in three lines. MT is responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. Loss of milteine transporter was associated with one line. MT is encoded by two genes with different expression levels. Reduced expression was associated with loss of 3' untranslated region of dominant gene due to structural variations at locus. Regions of homology between genes and presence of SIDER retrotransposons promote these variations. In one case, loss MT expression not associated with loss of virulence in macrophages in vivo. Sequence instability known in Leish genomes, associated with major antileman drug with no fitness costs, a significant concern.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain during sensory encoding. They used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity in humans performing a visual task where they attended to or ignored a stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. Results showed that surprising stimuli evoked responses were encoded as the difference between predicted and observed features, and attention facilitated this type of information in the brain. This supports a predictive coding theory that attention optimizes expectations by increasing the gain of prediction errors, suggesting attention increases selectivity for mismatch information in response to surprising stimuli. An alternative model proposes attention modulates activity of prediction neurons, suggesting a synergistic effect on selectivity for feature information. The study demonstrates attention boosts mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli, consistent with a predictive theory that attention optimizes precision by increasing gain of errors. A significant effect of attention was found on mismatch response to surprising but not unpredictable stimuli around 150ms after onset, reaching significance at 350ms. The study aimed to determine type of information modulated in interaction between attention and prediction, using forward models to quantify selectivity for orientation and mismatch in responses to surprising and unpredictable stimuli in the oddball paradigm.
Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite of sub-Saharan Africa, is divided into three sub-species: T. b. brucei, T. rhodesense, and T. gambense. T. b. brucei is unable to infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanolytic factors (TLF) 1 and 2 in human serum. T. rhodesense and T. gambense are resistant to lysis by TLF. Two subgroups of T. gambense differ genetically and in human resistance phenotypes. Group 1 T. gambense has an invariant phenotype, while group 2 shows variable resistance. Previous data suggest group 1 T gambense is resistant to TLF due to reduced uptake of TLF mediated by reduced expression of TLF receptor, the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HbHR) gene. This study investigates if true for group 2 parasites. Isogenic resistant and sensitive group 2 T gambense were derived and compared to T bruce parasites. Both express HHR at similar levels and internalized fluorescent labeled TLF in similar to T bruce. Both resistant and sensitive group 2, as well as group 1 gambense, internalize recombinant AP1, but only sensitive 2 are lysed. Data indicate group 1 gambense avoiding TLF is resistant to main component AP1. Similarly, group 2 gambense is innately resistant AP1, possibly based on same mechanism. However, group 2 gambense variably displays phenotype and does not correlate with HHR expression or expression. Differences in human resistance mechanisms between T gambense groups 1 and 2 exist.
Researchers have investigated the role of DNA methylation in controlling HIV-1 latency, a state where the virus is dormant and not actively replicating. They found that methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) is an epigenetic mechanism that restricts reactivation of latent HIV-1 and determines its stability. Methylation acts as a late event during latency establishment and is not required for initial silencing. In patients with undetectable viremia, HIV-1 promoters and enhancers are hypermethylated and resistant to reactivation, while those with viremia have hypomethyl 5LTR. However, dense methylation of HIV-1 5LTR does not confer complete resistance to reactivation with histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein kinase agonists, and 5-aza-2deoxycytidine. The study proposes a two-step epigenetic control model of HIV-1 latency. Methylation of HIV-1 5LTR is an additional mechanism that prevents reactivation and determines latency stability, but is not required for initial silencing.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the genomic variation in Drosoph melanogaster, a model organism, to understand the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. They created a nucleotide catalog of single-nucleotide, multiucle, and structural variants in 39 Dophila Genetic Panel lines, identifying over 3.6 million distinct variants, including 800,000 insertions, deletions, and complex variants. The study found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are more frequent than other variants, but not due to mutagenic or mutation-prone regions, but rather due to population-level processes. The researchers also mapped cis-expression trait loci (cisQTL) for over 2,000 genes, finding that insertions comprise 10% of all cisQTL and show larger effects than SNPs cisQTL. Additionally, they identified more gene associations in males than females and found most cisQ are sex-specific, revealing a decoupling of genomic architecture between sexes and importance of genetic factors mediating sex-based expression. RNA-seq-based allelic imbalance analyses in offspring of sequenced lines validated most cisQ in heterozygous individuals.
A study investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on the association between frequency components in the neural drive to muscle and rectified EMG signal. The rectified EM signal is commonly used to estimate neural drive to muscles and infer synaptic input to motor neurons. However, loss of EM amplitude due to overlap of motor action potentials (cancellation) may distort the rectified EM spectrum and its correlation with neural drive. Analytical and computational models of motor activity, force, and EM signal showed that rectified EM without cancellation (EMnc) is superior to actual rectified EM as estimator of neural drive. Simulations confirmed this, with average coefficient of determination (r2) between neural in 1-30 Hz and EMnc (0.59±0.08) matching correlation between rectified EM and neural at low cancellation levels (<40%). Correlation decreased linearly with cancellation (r=-0.83) to r<0.2 at levels >60%. Simulations showed stronger neural drive implied stronger correlation between rectified EM and neural, with cancellation distorting mainly low-frequency (<5 Hz) components. Results indicate amplitude distorts rectified EM signal, implying valid use of rectified EM as estimator requires low levels and/or strong synaptic input to motor neurons.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism behind auxin's role in inhibiting root growth in response to aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis. They found that YUC, a flavin monooxygenase-like protein, regulates auxin biosynthesis in the root transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. Al upregulates Y3/5/7/9 in the rootTZ, leading to aux accumulation and root inhibition. This regulation is dependent on ethylene signaling, as disrupting it either enhances or reduces Y upregulation in response to Al. Ethylene also enhances root inhibition under Al, which is alleviated in yuc mutants or co-treated with yucas, an inhibitor of Y activity. Eth-insensitive 3 (E3) is involved in regulating Y9 transcription. PIF4 functions as a transcription activator for Y5/8, promoting Al-inhibited growth by regulating local aux in theTZ. Al-induced P4 inTZ acts downstream of eth signaling. The study highlights a cascade for Y-regulated aux biosynthesis in theTZ mediating growth response to Al.
Researchers investigated the interaction between simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides and natural killer (NK) cells in rhes macs. They found that certain SIV peptides bound to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule Mam-A*002 stabilize its interaction with the inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) Mam-K3DL05, suppressing NK cell activity. Twenty-eight of 75 SIV peptides bound to Mam-A002 inhibited the cytolytic activity of Mam-K3+ NK cells, including immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes. Substitutions at C-terminal positions changed inhibitory peptides into disinhibitory, and vice versa, without altering binding to Mam002. The effects of these variants on NK responses corresponded to their effects on Mam002 tetramer binding Mam-K05. In mixtures of inhibitory and disinitory peptides, low concentrations of inhibitory dominated to suppress NK responses. Consistent with inhibition of Mam-K NK by epitopes presented Mam002, SIV replication was higher in Mam002 CD+ lymphocytes co-cultured with Mam-K NK than Mam-K cells.
Researchers investigated how the evolution of Haemophilus influenzae in response to transient nutrient limitation affects its ability to colonize and persist in the host during otitis media (OM). They hypothesized that strains adapted to nutrient limitation would be more adept at colonization and evasion of host immune responses, leading to persistence. In a preclinical model of OM, they observed that a mutant strain with decreased 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiester activity had a significant decrease in middle ear effusion, a clinical indicator of disease resolution. However, this strain formed more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the parental strain during OM, suggesting a mucosal reservoir following disease resolution. The study provides insight into NTH evolution during nutritional limitation and demonstrates IBC in a preclinical OM model.
Burkholderia pseudomalle, the causative agent of meloidosis, modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate iron availability and intracellular survival. Infection of primary macrophages with B. pseudalle results in downregulation of ferroport, leading to higher iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of iron export by hepcin or supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate increases intracellular iron, stimulating pseudalle growth, whereas iron chelation with deferoxamine reduces bacterial survival. Iron-loaded macrophages exhibit lower NADPH oxidase, iNOS, lipocalin 2, cytokine, and caspase-1 activation. Infection of mice causes diminished ferport expression, higher liver iron retention, and lower serum iron levels (hypofermia). In vivo administration of ferric ammonium citrate promotes bacterial growth and inflammatory response, whereas iron limitation significantly ameliorates bacterial clearance, attenuates cytokine levels, and improves survival. Data indicate modulation of cellular iron balance is a strategy for pseudalle to improve acquisition and restrict antibacterial effector mechanisms, promoting intracellular growth. Changes in iron homeostasis influence susceptibility to meloidosis, suggesting iron chel drugs as a therapeutic option.
Researchers have developed a novel technique called "functional mode analysis" to identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to their function. This method uses an ensemble of structures and a "functional quantity" that measures the protein's functional state to detect the motion most correlated with the quantity. The quantity can be a geometric, electrostatic, chemical, or other variable relevant to the protein's function. Additionally, the motion most likely to induce a change in the quantity is estimated from the ensemble. Two correlation measures are used: the Pearson coefficient for linear correlation and mutual information for any interdependence. This approach allows deriving a model for the functional state in terms of a single coordinate. The technique was applied to several biomolecules, including polyalanine-helix, T lysozyme, Trpase, and leucine-binding protein.

The method, termed "functional mode analysis" (MA), systematically identifies functionally relevant collective motions in proteins. It extracts the linear motion maximally correlated with an arbitrary quantity relevant to the protein's function. Established methods like PCA and NMA elucidate large and low-frequency modes, but do not necessarily yield motions related to function. Complementary to MD simulations, PCA and N are used to investigate collective motions. PCA extracts motions with largest variance, while N identifies low-frequency modes. Elastic models assess intrinsic motions to the structure. Many proteins function through structural transitions like motions, rotations, or reorientations. For some, it's unclear how functionally quantities relate to collective motions. The technique elucidates relations between dynamics and function.
Researchers studied the order of intron removal from transcripts of the tubA and gap genes in Euglena gracilis, which contain both conventional and non-conventional introns. Non-conventional introns do not have conserved characteristics of spliceosomal introns or complementary U1 snRNA at the 5' end, but form a stable secondary structure with exon/intron junctions. In contrast, conventional introns have conserved positions or are lost. The study found that non-conventional introns are removed before spliceosomal introns, and intermediate products of splicing were analyzed using PacBio Next Generation Sequencing. The results suggest a time gap between the two types of splicing. Non-conventional introns of Eugids are extensively studied, with about 100 described, and insert at new positions, whereas conventional introns are conserved or lost. Intermediate introns have features of both conventional and non-conventional introns. Only few genes annotated, but confirmed on genomic level. Non-conventional introns form a stable structure with exon/intron junction, not resembling self-splicing or tRNA introns, conserved to small extent.
Researchers investigated the impact of Coxsackievirus B (CV) infection on cardiac progenitor cells and postnatal heart development in mice. CVB is an enterovirus that commonly causes self-limited fever in infants, but severe cases can manifest as acute myocarditis. Chronic consequences of mild CV infection are unknown, but there is an epidemiological association between early subclinical infections and late heart failure, suggesting possible damage leading to late-onset dysfunction or ongoing injury due to inflammatory reactions during latent infection. A mouse model of juvenile infection with subclinical dose Coxsievirus B3 (CV3) showed no symptoms immediately following infection or in adult mice, but underwent cardiac hypertrophy and dilation indicative of progression to heart failure under physiological or pharmac-induced stress. Evaluation of vasculature in hearts of mice subjected to cardiac stress showed compensatory increase in CD31+ vessel formation, suppressed in juvenile-infected mice. CV3 efficiently infected c-kit+ cells, and cardiac progenitor numbers reduced in hearts of juvenile-infected mice. Results suggest exhausted progenitor pool following CV3 may impair heart's ability to increase capillary density adapt to increased load.
Researchers investigated the role of caspase-1 and cell death pathways in Burkholderia pseudalle infection of macrophages. They found that caspase-1 processing and pyptosis are dependent on NLRC, not NLRP, in the early phase of macroph infection, but later casase-1 activation and cell death are NLRC-independent. In the early phase, a pathway involving casases-9, -7, and PAR downstream of NLRC and casase-1 was identified. Casase-1 deficient macrophages showed strong apoptosis, dependent on activation of apoptotic and effector casases. The activation of casase-1 in macroph was reduced or abolished with B. pseudalle flagellin F or TSS3B mutant. The TSS effector protein B was shown to play a role in casase-1 processing. A TSS inner protein mutant failed to activate casase, had higher intracellular counts, reduced death, and IL-1 secretion in early but not late macroph infection. Intranasal infection of BAL/c mice with the mutant showed decreased mortality, lower bacterial loads, IL, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage. The results indicate a major role of TSS in NLRC casase-1 activation pypt and contribution of casase-dependent cell mechanisms in B pseudalle pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated the role of Arabidopsis Kβ, a subunit of the SNF1-related kinase complex, in pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. They found that Arabid Kβ is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of vegetative cells in pollen grains and is essential for pollen germination on the stigma. A mutant Arabid Kβ pollen failed to germinate on the stigma, but germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed compromised hydration of mutant pollen on the stigma, which was rescued by adding water to the stigma. The mutant exhibited defective biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxomes, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Overexpressing Arabid CATAL3, which reduces ROS, compromised pollen hydration on the stigma. These results indicate Arabid Kβ regulates ROS levels by mediating biogenesis of mitochond and peroxomes in pollen, required for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two prophages, Skin and SP, through the degradation of antisense RNA. Unlike in other organisms, where RNase is not essential, in B. subtilis, its presence is necessary for survival. Two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txA and yT, from the prophages Skin and SP, are sensitive to RNase. The mechanism of RNase-mediated decay of txA mRNA paired with its antisense RNA, Rat, was explored in vivo and in vitro. RNase is not involved in ribosomal RNA maturation or mRNA turnover in B. subtil, as it is in other bacteria. The absence of prophages or toxin-encoding mRNAs, deletion of the RNase gene is possible, and growth of resulting strains is unaffected. The role of RNase in B. subtil is distinct from its function in other organisms, where it is part of a defense mechanism against viral infection.
Researchers studied the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi, which causes Lymphatic Filariasis. They found that EVs are released by all life stages of the parasite, including microfilar, L3, L4, adult male and female worms, and are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the EV proteome, defining the biogenesis of Brug EV and sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomod cargo. Ivermect was found to inhibit EV release by all Brug life stages, also observed in the related nemat Dirofilar imitis but not in iverect-unresponsive isolate, suggesting a mechanism of action for this drug and new platforms for anti-filar drug development.
A cross-sectional survey conducted in ten rural villages in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands found a high prevalence of scabies and impigo. The total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% (95% CI 17.5-21.0) and age and gender weighted 19.2% (95 CI 16.7-21.9). The adult prevalence of scabies was 10.4% (95 CI 8.2-13.2), with the highest in infants under 1 year (34.1, adjusted ratio 3.6, 95 CI 2.2-6) and children 1-4 (25.7, ratio 2.6, CI 1.7-3.9). Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80.9% of participants and 4.4% were classified as severe. The unweighted prevalence of impigo was 32.7 (95 CI 30.6-34.8) and age and gender 26.7 ( CI 24.2-29.5). The highest was in children 1-4 (42.6, ratio 4.1, CI 2.9-5.8). Scabies was associated with impigo (ratio 2, 95 CI 1.6-2.6), with 41.1 of imp cases also having scabies.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and T cells in adult mice. They found a significant correlation between the proportions of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocyte subsets and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. This correlation is driven by genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2a locus, which influences T subsets but not neurogenesis. Knockout and repopulation of Tα-deficient mice confirmed the influence of T cells on adult neurogenesis, indicating CD4 T cells mediate the effect. The study reveals a broader impact of genetic variation on T cell development and homeostasis than previously suspected. Naturally occurring genetic variation is more physiologically relevant than knockout models. The correlation is due to sequence variants that differentiate inbred strains of mice. The findings extend previous observations that T cells contribute to adult neurogenesis. Analysis of outbred mice indicates the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation is not an artefact of transgenic or knockout mice, but due to subtle genetic loci that contribute to variation in hippocampal proliferation. A correlation is found between cellular proliferation and relative proportions of CD4 and CD8 T cells, with higher proliferation associated with higher CD8 and lower CD4 cells. The correlation accounts for 6% of phenotypic variance.
Researchers investigated the efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine (TVac2) against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and emerging in the US. The vaccine consisted of antigens identified by computational analysis of the parasite's sequence and cytokines IL-12 and GM-CSF expression plasmids. Mice were immunized with antigen-encoding plasmids plus cytokine adjuvants, followed by recombinant proteins and challenged with T. cruzi trypastigotes. ELISA and flow cytometry measured humoral and cellular responses. TVac induced strong antigen-specific antibody (Ig2>Ig1) and moderate lymphocyte proliferation. Upon challenge, TVac-vaccinated mice expanded Ig2/Ig1 and elicited substantial CD+ T response with type 1 cytokines (IF-γ and TN-α) controlling acute parasite burden. During chronic phase, response persisted, splenic activation CD+ cells and IF-γ/TNF- cytokines subsided, and IL-4/10 cytokines became dominant in vaccinated mice. Tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in heart and skeletal of TVac-vaccinated mice were undetectable by histological techniques. In contrast, injected vector or cytokines only responded T. cruz by elicitation mixed type 1/type 2 antibody, cell and cytok response, exhibiting persistent burden and immunology in myocardium. TVac-induced type 1 and lymphocyte responses provided resistance acute T. cruz infection, preventing chronic immunology associated parasite in chasic hearts.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying susceptibility loci for complex diseases, but the question remains whether individual disease risk can be quantified based on genotype data for personalized prevention and treatment. Previous studies have failed to achieve satisfactory performance due to limited confirmed loci use. This study proposes machine learning approaches with ensemble markers to improve disease assessment. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was applied to a GW dataset on type 1 diabetes (T1) and optimized a risk model with hundreds of markers. The model was tested on an independent Illumina-genotyped dataset (1,008 cases, 1,000 controls) and a separate Affymrix-genotyped dataset (1,529,1,458) with area under curve (AUC) of ∼0.84 in both. In contrast, poor performance was achieved with limited known loci in SVM or logistic regression. The study suggests disease assessment can be improved by algorithms accounting for interactions between large markers. Genotype-based risk may be feasible for diseases with notable risk captured by SNP arrays. A machine learning approach, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and logistic regression were tested for individual risk assessment of type 1 diabetes using three GW datasets. SVM achieved satisfactory performance with hundreds of SNPs, AUC ∼0.84 in several datasets. In contrast, SVM or logistic regression achieved AUC 0.66-0. A third dataset from the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes consortium was genotyped on the same platform as WTCCC1 and used shared markers for risk. The model can take additional predictor variables. Results from GW have enormous data for disease understanding, including risk using genetic profiles. False hits will arise, but approaches are robust with non-contributing markers and established markers.
Researchers have investigated the behavior of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that provides protection against viral infections, after they enter non-lymphoid tissues such as the skin during a secondary infection. They found that these cells traffic into the skin independently of CD62-mediated lymph node reactivation and provide robust immunity against Vaccinia virus (Vac) infection. Central memory (T) CD8 T cells, but not effector (TEM) memory CD8 T cells, differentiate into functional CD69+/CD- tissue residents following viral clearance, which is dependent on local antigen recognition in the skin environment. Memory CD8 T cells express granzyme and utilize cytolytic activity to provide immunity against Vac infection. This study demonstrates that central memory CD8 T cells become cytolytic following skin infiltration to protect against viral infection and differentiate into functional tissue residents.
Researchers have investigated the role of Myosin VI, a minus-directed motor protein, in the localization of axonal proteins in neurons. They found that Myos VI plays a crucial role in enriching proteins on the surface of axons by stimulating dendrite endocytosis, a mechanism that has been shown to underlie the localization of many axonal proteins. To test this, they engineered a non-neuronal protein to interact with Myos VI, causing it to become concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated cortical neurons. Disruption of Myos VI function or expression led to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Additionally, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myos VI was concentrated at the axonal surface of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, suggesting it could be a tool for probing circuit and function. The study indicates that myos help shape polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, necessary for proper electrical signaling.
Researchers have identified two Doublesex (Dsx) genes, DmaD1 and DmaD2, in the freshwater branchiop crustace Daphnia magna, a species that parthenogenetically produces males in response to environmental cues. One of these genes, DmaD1, is responsible for male development during environmental sex determination. The organization of DmaD1 is similar to that of Dsx in insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiop crustans. However, the molecular basis of sexually dimorphic expression of DmaD1 differs from insects, as it exhibits differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific pre-mRNA splicing in the coding region. During embryogenesis, expression ofmaD1 is increased in males and transcripts are primarily detected in male structures. Knockdown ofma1 in males resulted in female traits, including ovary formation, while ectopic expression in females resulted in male-like phenotypes. Expression ofma2 is similar toma1 but silencing and overexpression did not induce clear phenotypic changes. These results establishma1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. The study reveals how environmental sex determination is implemented by selective expression of a conserved genetic component in genetic sex-determining animals, inferring an ancient link between genetic and environmental determination.
Researchers have developed a trivalent HSV-2 vaccine that targets glycoproteins C, D, and E (g2, D, g2, E) to prevent genital herpes infection. The vaccine was tested in rhes macaques and guinea pigs. In rhes macques, the trivalent vaccine induced plasma and mucosal antibodies that blocked g2 and g2 immune evasion and stimulated CD4 cell responses. After vaginal challenge, a limited infection was detected in naïve but not trivalent immunized macques. In guinea pigs, the trivalent and trivalent +D groups were 97% and 99% efficacious in preventing lesions, outperforming g2 alone. Vaginal swabs showed reduced HSV-2 DNA and replication in all groups, with fewer days of shedding competent virus in trivalent g2 and none in trivalent +D. The trivalent had <1% lesions and 0.2% shedding competent virus. The vaccine has potential for preventing genital herpes in humans.
Researchers have developed a new method called Perm-se to improve the mapping of protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of the genome using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (Ch-se ). These regions are difficult to map due to short reads (50-100 base pairs) mapping to multiple locations in the reference genome. Standard methods discard multi-mapping reads or are prone to false positives and negatives. Perm-se uses data from DNase hypersensitive sequencing (DN-se) and histone Ch-se to allocate multiapping reads with high accuracy. It was evaluated on 64 ENCODE Ch-se datasets from GM78 and K562 cells, identifying novel protein-D interactions in segment duplications. These interactions are evolutionarily conserved and share characteristics with non-repet regions. A probabilistic model was developed to utilize DN-se priors and maps reads from repetitive regions with high accuracy. The method is versatile and can incorporate multiple data sources like histone-se for allocation.
A nested case-control study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the effects of schistosiasis on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 viral load at HIV-1 seroconversion. Approximately 40% of the population had Schistosoma mansoni infection and 2% had S. haematobium. Women with schist infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without (adjusted OR 2.8 [1.2-6], p=0.019). Schist-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition (adjusted OR 0.7 [0.3-1.8], p=0.42). HIV-1 RNA levels in post-serconversion blood in HIV-1 serconverters with schistosias were significantly higher than those without schosias: 4.4 [3.9-4.6] log copies/mL versus 3.7 [3.2-4], p=0.017. Pre-existing schist infection increased odds of HIV-1 in women and raised HIV-1 viral load at HIV-1 serconversion.
Researchers investigated the variability of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and sequence in human and mouse genomes, particularly in the context of cancer. Using computational and droplet digital PCR approaches, they found that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Contrary to expectations, human cancer genomes showed a loss of rDNA copies accompanied by global copy number variation. The sequence was also more variable in cancer genomes. Genomes with lower rDNA copies had mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. The PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor, is critical for genome stability and negative regulator of mTOR pathway. Surprisingly, hematopoietic cancer cells from PTEN-/- mouse model leukemia had lower rDNA number than normal cells, despite increased rRNA and protein production. Loss occurred early and was associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. rDNA copy loss is a feature in cancers with mTOR activation, suggesting it may be an indicator of sensitivity to DNA treatments.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study the dynamics of bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts during an infection. They used tagged wild-type and isogenic strains of Salmonella enterica, which are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished by quantitative PCR. This allowed them to estimate bacterial death rates based on the disappearance of strains over time. A multidisciplinary approach established the timing, occurrence, and control of key infection parameters in a host-pathogen combination. Analyses showed that shortly after infection, concom death and rapid bacterial replication led to establishment of independent subpopulations in organs, controlled by antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased mortality led to exponential increase in bacteria spread, locally, with mixing between organs via bactemia and stochastic. This approach provides an unprecedented view of pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating spatial and stochastic effects driving disease. The method can be applied to diverse host-pathogen combinations, with modelling data, for comprehensive view of within-host dynamics.
Researchers have investigated the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion perception, which is the process by which the brain reconstructs 3D motion from visual information from two eyes. Current models of 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding motion and disparity, do not provide a general solution to this problem. Instead, the authors suggest that combining local velocity constraints with binocular disparity and other cues offers a more flexible framework for solving the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem, they derive two plausible strategies: (1) the normal prefers motion in 3D and (2) cyclopean motion based on slow in 2. Predicting motion for ambiguous lines provides an opportunity to distinguish between these strategies of 3D processing. Theoretical results indicate that velocity and disparity from tracking are necessary to solve 3 motion perception. It is plausible that motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated in the visual hierarchy.

Existing models of 3D motion are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3 motion. Velocity constraints in binocular geometry demonstrate that additional information is necessary to disambiguate velocity and derive an estimate. Integration of motion and disparity with other cues can solve the inverse of local 3 motion, allowing the system to remain flexible when segmenting inputs from different stages into a 3 percept. Geometric intersection of two planes in binocular geometry defines a line in 3 velocity space. Tracking features in depth with bin velocity provides a strategy to disiguate 3 direction and solve the problem.
Researchers have investigated the role of AlgJ, a protein involved in the O-acetylation of alginate, a polysaccharide produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. They determined the structure of Alg to 1.83 resolution and found it to be a SGN hyrolase-like protein, similar to the N-terminal domain of AlgX, but with a distinct electrostatic surface potential. A conserved catalytic triad of D190, H192 and S288 was identified, and Alg exhibited acetylease activity in vitro. Residues in Alg signature motifs formed extensive interactions critical for alginate Oetylation in vivo. Using electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) assays, Alg and Alg binding to alginate were compared. Alg exhibited weak or no detectable binding, while Alg bound polymannonic acid in a length-dependent manner, and utilized acetyl donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze alginate Oety. The results suggest Alg and Alg have separate roles in alg Oetylation, with Alg as the terminal transferase.
Candida albicans, a common cause of human fungal infections and a significant source of mortality, evades detection by the innate immune system through masking its cell wall's inner layer of β(1,3)-gluc with an outer layer of heavily glycosylated mannoprote (mannan). However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β(1,3)-glan unmasking and detection by innate cells like Dect-1, C-type lectin. The phosphatidylser (PS) synthase Cho1 plays a role in β(1,3)-glan masking, with homozygous mutant choΔ exhibiting increased exposure. Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAP) pathways and upstream Rho small Gases regulate cell biogenesis and remodeling. In choΔ, C1 and M1 MAPs are constitutively activated, acting downstream of Gases C42 and R1, respectively. C42 activity is upregulated in choΔ. Activation of C42 or R1 and downstream kinases cause unmasking. Disruption of M1 does not decrease unmask inΔ, and hyperactivation R1 in wild-type increases unmask and activates C1 and M1. Hyperactivation Ste11 in wild-type leads to C1 activation and β(1)-glan exposure. Upregulation of C1 MAP causes unmask, responsible for unmask inΔ.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study of genetic loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropath data defined clinico-path AD or controls, coreath features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibr tangles, NFT), and coorbid neuropath changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular injury (BI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clin-path AD, NPs, NFT, CAA, and L with variants in apolipoprotein E (APO), GAL7, ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), and intergenic region 9. Twelve of 21 non-APO genetic loci for clin-defined AD were confirmed in clin-path sample: CR1, BIN, CL, MS4A, PICAL, ABC, CD, TK, SOR, MEF, ZW, C4 with 9 of 12 showing odds ratio in clin-path. Correlation effect sizes for AD with NFT or NPs showed positive, while for VBI showed negative. Co-mor neuropath features showed nominal association with known loci. New associations were discovered with neuropath features and aligned genetic AD risk with specific changes in brain study of AD and dementias.
Researchers have long used urea as a denaturant to study protein unfolding, but its role in the process remains unclear: does it induce unfolding or stabilize the unfolded state? To address this, a study analyzed 30 proteins with diverse folds through molecular dynamics simulations using various force fields, deriving rules for urea unfolding valid at the proteome level. Irrespective of fold, disulfide bridges, or secondary structure, ure concentrates in the first solvation shell of native proteins with lower density than unfolded. Urea doesn't alter spontaneous vibrations, but reduces their magnitude, slowing atomic motions opposing unfolding. Urea's stickiness and diffusion are crucial for unfolding, with long molecules around hydrophobic cores stabilizing partially open structures. Simulations show ure doesn't favor open states, but actively unfolds, selecting and stabilizing partially, driving the ensemble far from native and thermal conformations.

Data indicates van der Waals drive ure accumulation on folded surfaces, but H-bonding stabilizes long-living interactions near hinges, biasing dynamics towards unfolding. Results provide a complete picture of ure's role in destabilizing folded states and mechanisms contributing to unfolding. Urea is a denatur used for decades, but its properties remain elusive. The dominant "direct" mechanism claims ure interacts strongly with exposed residues more than water. Under 8M ure at 368K, unfolding signals appear, but progress is smaller than stable proteins. Unfolding at 368 after 1µsec is independent of fold, structure, and similar with/without disulf bridges.
A systematic review was conducted to describe the epidemiology of deng disease in Colombia between 2000 and 2012. Literature searches were conducted using the terms "deng", "epemiology", and "Colia" in English and Spanish. 225 citations were identified, with 30 meeting the inclusion criteria. The epidemiology ofeng disease in Colombia was characterized by a stable annual number of deng fever cases, with outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. Geographical spread ofeng cases increased, with most of the country affected by 2010. The majority ofeng cases were among those under 15 years old. Gaps in knowledge regardingeng disease in Colombia include asymptomaticeng infection, secondary infections, and underreporting. Improved understanding of factors determining disease expression is important for control and management.

The review describes national and regional trends, incidence by age and sex, seroprevalence and serotype, and other data. The review is part of a series in selected countries and Asia. It highlights non-severe deng disease reported in 201. There is a lack of information on asymptomaticeng, primary infections, severity, and underreporting in Colombia. Improved surveillance may address these gaps. Nationwide data showed a 90% increase in municipalities from 200 to 201 (424 to 743). Incidence was low in south-east Colombia, due to lowest population density.
Leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease caused by Leish parasites that affects skin and mucosal tissues. Patients with TL may concurrently carry other pathogens, which can influence the disease outcome. This review focuses on the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leish and other pathogens in animal and human models, and implications for clinical practice. TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous, localized, disseminated, or mucocutaneous leishias. HIV coinfection, superinfection with bacteria, and manifestations of visceral leishias are not included. A literature search yielded 73 records: 21 studies in animals and 52 in humans, mainly cross-sectional and case studies. Reports describe Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina (41%) and helminthias in TL in Brazil (15-88%). Mechanisms of interaction between microorganisms are explored, but no clear answers emerge. Interactions may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting quality and quantity of immune responses. Diagnostic problems occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), when pathogens present in same lesions (e.g., Leish and Sporothrix schenii), or similarities phylogenetically close pathogens affect accuracy tests (e.g., serology leishias and Chagas). Coinfections (e.g., helthias) reduce effectiveness of antileman treatment and combinations cause cumulative effects. In TL patients, coinfection is frequent, leading to diagnostic delays and treatment effectiveness and safety.
Researchers investigated the impact of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on CD4:CD lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats. They used two genetic models, the heterogeneous stock (HS) and a panel of M-recombinant congenic strains, to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and CD:CD T cell ratio. Ten QTL were identified across the genome, and those for individual traits colocalized within a region spanning the MHC. To identify genes underlying these QTL, a large panel of M-rebinant congenic strains was generated, and QTL refined to adjacent intervals of 0.25 Mb in the M-I and II regions. An interaction between these intervals affected M class I expression as well as negative selection and commitment of CD single-positive (SP) thymocytes. The effect was mapped to transporter associated antigen 2 (Tap) in the M-II region and classical M class gene (RT-A) in M-I. This interaction was revealed by recombination between RT-A and Tap, occurring in 0.2% of rats. Variants of Tap have been shown to influence antigenicity M class molecules by altering the class ligome. Results showed a restricted repertoire on M class molecules leads to reduced selection CD cells. This is the first study showing recombination between alleles in M influences commitment of cells.
This study analyzed hospital discharge records from Spain's National Health System's Hospital Discharge Database (CMB) to describe Chagas disease evolution from 1997 to 2011. A total of 1729 hospitalizations were identified, with rates of 18.2/100,000 and 24.2/100,000 population for the periods 1997-2004 and 2005-201, respectively. The median age was 35 years (0-87), with 74% female and 16-45 age group mostly represented (69.8%). 23.4% hospitalizations included Chagas disease with complications. Being male, aged 45-64, and hospitalization cost above 3,065 euros were associated with organ complications. Since 2005, detected infections increased in Spain, with asymptomatic patients, fertile women, and conditions associated with organ complications highlighting the need for early detection of T. cruzi.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called Blocuster to identify combinatorial interactions of genetic factors that contribute to complex diseases, such as psoriasis. This method efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks that segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors and tests their associations with a given phenotype, rigorously validating results using unbiased methods. Blocuster employs a correlation measure for single nucleotide polymorphisms and captures genetic heterogeneity. The team applied Blocuster to psoriasis data, discovering a combinator pattern with an odds ratio of 3.64 and Bonferr-corrected p-value 5.01×10−16. This was replicated in independent data, demonstrating the method's robustness. Blocuster improves disease prediction and understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis, and shows potential for discovering combinator genetic associations in genome-wide data, transcending "small" effects of individual markers in isolation. A Blocuster identified a bloc of 17 alleles in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) significantly associated with psoriasis, improving previous results by providing a precise allelic pattern. The odds ratio for the bloc was 3.45, compared to the highest single SNP odds of 2.41.41. Blocuster's network-based result is advantageous over conventional genome-wide association studies.
Researchers conducted a large-scale chromosomal copy number variation (CN) study in 255 patients with agenesis of the corpus callo (ACC), 220 with cerebellar hypoplasia (CBL), and 147 with polymicrogyria (PM), and 2,349 controls. They found that significantly more ACC patients had rare CNVs over 1 megabase compared to controls (p=1.48×10-3, odds ratio=3.19, 95% confidence interval=1.89-5.39), but not CBL or PM. Rare CNVs impacted at least 1% of the population. More ACC patients had CNVs over 20 genes compared to controls (p=0.01, odds=2.95, 95% CI=1.69-5.18). Independent PCR confirmation showed 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which preferentially overlapped with previously observed in autism disorders (p=3.06×10-4, odds=7.55, 95 CI=2.40-23). The study refined known CNs, including the 8p23.1-p.11 duplication in 2% of ACC, and found novel CNs in single patients, likely deleterious deletions and duplications. One patient with microcephaly had paternally inherited deletion 16.13 that included N1. Exome sequencing revealed recessive matally inherited mutation in non-deleted N1. This is the first systematic study of CN in congenital malformations, showing higher gene-rich CN in ACC than CBL and PM.
Researchers investigated the role of the Hippo signaling pathway effector Yorkie (Yki) in the regeneration of the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterrane. They found that Yki RNA interference (RNAi) animals exhibited hyperactivated and prolonged proliferative and transcriptional responses to injury, with increased stem cell proliferation and expression of wound-induced genes. Additionally, Yki RNAi animals showed expanded epidermal and muscle populations, which were hypothesized to be sources of wound-induced genes. However, Yki RNA animals failed to sense the size of an injury and correctly, and the brain, gut, and midline could not remodel to the size of the regenerating fragment. The study suggests that Y functions as a key molecule integrating multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury transcription, and patterning. The results indicate that Y's effects on the wound response in planarians are due to the repression of the wound program, increasing stem cell response through extrinsic signals. Y RNAi animals displayed hyperproliferation, increased differentiation, and TUN staining, similar to Y's role in intact animals, and upregulation of key members of the transcription wound response. Y is thought to be a transcription coactivator, but has non-autonomous effects in Y RNA animals.
Researchers investigated the role of exosomes in the transmission of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a virus that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease. They found that EV71-infected cells release exosomes containing viral RNA and microRNA-146, which is known to suppress the type I interferon response, a key part of the immune system. The exosomes also contained replication-competent EV RNA and proteins Ago2 and GW182, which allowed the virus to replicate in new cells independently of specific receptors. In recipient cells, the exosomal RNA replicated while mi-146 suppressed interferon response, facilitating viral replication. The study also found that interferon-stimulated genes, BST2/tether, regulated exosome secretion in EV71-infected cells. In vivo, exosomal RNA accumulated in tissues more than free virus particles. The findings suggest exosomes secreted by EV-infected cells package high levels of mi-146, which can be transferred and facilitate EV RNA replication in cells by suppressing interferon response.
Researchers have identified a protein, PG5, that modulates the activity of PINK, a gene responsible for early-onset Parkinson's disease, in fruit flies. PINK is a serine/threon kinase with a predicted mitochondrial sequence and transmembrane domain, while Parkin is a RING finger protein with ubiquitin ligase activity. The study found that loss of PG5 suppresses muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan caused by PINK inactivation, attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, PG5 inactivation fails to modulate phenotypes of Park mutant flies. Conversely, ectopic expression of PG5 exacerbated PINK and Park phenotypes. Results suggest PG5 regulates PINK pathway to maintain mitochondria, and acts between PINK and Park, or independently of Park downstream PINK. PINK is required to recruit Park to damaged mitochondria, promoting degradation through autophagy. Little is known how PINK regulates mitochondrial integrity through Park. Park mutations cause mitochondrial degeneration in subset of tissues, phenocopying PINK inactivation. PG5 is involved in PINK pathway, and affects in vivo phenotypes with Park mutations. Reducing mitochondrial fusion proteins or increasing fission can rescue PINK and Park phenotypes. PG5 is a PINK-binding protein, modulating PINK mutant phenotypes. Loss PG5 has little effect on lifespan of P1 RNA strain. The study demonstrates PG5 modulates PINK in flies. Further work is required to determine PG5 regulates PINK at molecular level and if manipulating PG5 provides therapeutic advantage in P1 PD.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ (IFNγ) in host defense against Mycobacterium ulcerans (M. ulcer) infection, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a chronic necrotizing skin disease. Histopathological analysis of BU lesions showed extracellular localization of acid-fast bacilli, but evidence suggests an early intracellular growth phase of M. ulcer. The study used an experimental BU mouse model and found that IFNγ is crucial for early immune defense against M. ulcer. IFN knockout mice had faster disease progression, with more tissue necrosis and edema, and higher bacterial burden after 5 weeks, indicating reduced intracellular killing of bacilli during early growth. This demonstrates IFγ's role in early defense against M. ulcer and supports the concept that tuberculosis vaccine strategies may be valid for BU. Reports of spontaneous healing and partial protection by Bacille Calmet-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in humans and mice indicate clearance of M. ulcer by the immune system, particularly before mycolone clusters form. The study shows IFγ-dependent activation of macrophage bactericidal activity helps contain infection during intracellular stages.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in mitochondria under hypoxia conditions. They developed a new methodology to mathematically analyze the process, considering all possible redox states in the electron transport chain. The model revealed two steady modes of operation (bistability) of respiratory complex III at the same conditions. Various perturbations can switch the chain from one mode to another. Normally, complex is in a low ROS producing mode, but ania can switch it to a high producing mode, which persists after oxygen return. This prediction was qualitatively validated experimentally, explaining ania-induced cell damage. The bistability of complex operation may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. The model can be applied to other biological systems.
Researchers used an integrative systems approach to investigate the regulatory effect of the terminal gene huckin (Hkb) on gap gene expression in the early Drosophila melanogaster embryo. They presented quantitative data on H protein expression, enabling the inclusion of H in gap gene circuit models. Gap circuits are mathematical models of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from spatial data by fitting models to expression patterns and obtaining estimates for parameters predicting network topology. Variability in data combined with analysis significantly improved biological relevance and consistency. Models agreed with earlier results, extending in two respects: H is involved in regulation of the posterior hunch (hb) domain, but not essential for other functions. H is required for anterior shift in posterior border of domain, reproduced in models. Gap circuits reproduced terminal gene mutants, previously unable to reproduce null mutants correctly, capturing expression of posterior genes and variational properties. This is a step towards understanding developmental and evolutionary dynamics of gap network.
Researchers have developed a novel immunotherapy for Brucellos, a zoonotic disease causing significant economic losses worldwide, by using phage lysates of Brucella abortus strains S19 and RB51. Currently, no effective immunotherapy or biomarker for Bruclos is available, and treatment is ineffective, with animals remaining lifelong carriers. The live attenuated vaccine strains S19 induces antibodies, but is ineffective against intracellular pathogen, while RB induces cell-mediated immunity (CMI) but is rifampicin-resistant. Both organisms are secreted in milk, infecting humans and causing abortions in animals. Phage lysates retain immunogenicity, opposed to heat or chemical killing. The study reports successful immunotherapy of bovine Bruclos by phage of RB51 (RL) and S (SL), inducing strong antibody and CMI responses. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from immunized cattle induced interferon production. A single subcutaneous dose of 2ml cocktail lysate (RL and SL) eliminated virulent Bruc from Bruclos affected cattle, with undetectable Bruc specific amplicons by RT-PCR and negative Bruc culture in 3 post-immunization. This is the first report on minimally invasive monitoring efficacy employing RNA specific bacteria as biomarker and use of RB phage for Bruclos immunotherapy in cattle.
Researchers investigated the role of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) in the DNA damage response in human cells. They found that Cdk activity is required for cell survival after exposure to ionizing radiation, as inhibition of C2 with a specific inhibitor decreased cell survival, while C2+ cells were not affected. This suggests a specific requirement for C2 in orchestrating an effective DNA response to damage. By manipulating C2 activity with small molecules, they showed that it is needed after damage occurs, excluding the possibility of pre-existing defects in C2 mutant cells. They developed tools to identify additional functions and targets of C2 in DNA response pathways. The study challenges the idea that CD activity in response to damage is general, with no specific need for C2 to repair or resume cell cycle after repair. In vivo, phosphorylation of N1, a component of the MRN complex, occurs during S phase and is prevented by CD blockade or delayed by inhibition of C2. Mutations of N1-S432 that prevent phosphorylation increase sensitivity to cell-killing by IR, phenocopying selective inhibition C2. The study uncovered a C2-dependent pathway in DNA response of human cells.
Researchers used the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method to map active regulatory elements at loci associated with hematological traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction in megakarycytic and erythroblast cell lines. They found distinct patterns of open chromatin in the two cell types, with cell-specific openatin guiding the finding of functional variants. An openatin region on chromosome 7q22.3 in megaryocytes but not erythroblasts was identified, harboring the non-coding variant rs342 associated with platelet volume function. Resequencing this region in 643 individuals provided evidence that rs342 is the causative variant. The C- and G-differentially bind transcription factor EV1, affecting PI3CG expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein-protein interaction network in Pikcg knockout mice indicated PI3 is associated with pathways in platelet biogenesis and thrombus formation. This is the first elucidated variant among platelet quantitative loci. The study suggests a molecular mechanism for non-coding GWA SNP modulating plate phenotype.
Researchers simulated the effects of blocking a persistent sodium current (INa) in respiratory circuits using two pharmacological blockers with distinct mechanisms of action: tetrodotoxin (TX) and ruzole (R). TX directly blocks the sodium pore, while R shifts INa inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. In vitro studies using TX or R suggested IN is critical for bursting in pacemaker neurons and network generation in the pre-Betz complex. However, simulations show that R fails to block INP in the intact network due to its pharmacological mechanism and inhibitory interactions. Pre-bursting in the network is likely dependent on both inhibitory interactions and INP. TX application in the network is predicted to terminate rhythmicity. The hypothesis that INP is necessary for rhythmogenesis has fallen out of favor due to INP block by R failing to stop rhythms in intact preparations. This is based on the assumption R effectively blocks INP in vivo. The study predicts that after R, INP can be reactivated by hyperpolar perturbations due to R's mechanism. Simulated TX of INP does not yield the same effect.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-218 (mi-218) in the metastasis of gastric cancer (GC). They found that mi-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC and its host gene, Slit, is also downregulated. However, mi-218 negatively regulates Robo1, a Sl receptor, establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased mi-218 levels eliminate Rob1 repression, activating the Sl-Robo pathway through Rob1 and Sl2 interaction, promoting metastasis. Restoring mi-218 suppresses Rob1 and inhibits cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and vivo. The study reveals a Slit-mi-218-Robo regulatory circuit disruption contributing to GC metastasis, suggesting targeting mi-218 as a strategy to block metastasis. Upregulation of Rob1 in response to decreased mi-218 upregulates the Sl-Robo pathway through interaction with Sl2, facilitating cell invasion and metastasis. Rob1 is overexpressed in cancer and promotes angiogenesis and metastasis via Sl interaction. The inverse relationship between mi-218 and Rob1 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in 40 GC cases and matched normal tissues. Rob1 is upregulated in GC, especially metastatic GC, with low mi-218 expression. Rob1 is a critical target of mi-218, an axon guidance receptor for Sl conserved in animals. Induction of Rob1 by Rob1 construct without mi-218 site reverses mi- suppression of tumor invasion, while Rob1 knockdown reduces invasion similar to restoring mi-218.
Researchers investigated the effects of plasma cholesterol-lowering on atherosclerosis development and identified a network of cholesterol-responsive genes that prevent the formation of advanced atherosclerotic plaques. Atherosclerosis-prone mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia and genetic switch to lower lipoproteins (Lr−/−po100Mflox/floxM1-C) were used for transcription profiling at 10-week intervals. Lesions progressed slowly, then rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of expression indicated accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to rapid expansion with foam formation and inflammation, supported by histology. Lowering plasma cholesterol prevented formation of advanced plaques and transcription profiling identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages with acetylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-accumulation. A network of atherosclerosis genes in response to plasma-lowering prevents formation advanced plaques, of interest for novel atherosclerosis therapies.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the bacterial envelope of Gram-negative bacteria, a complex barrier that makes it difficult for antimicrobial drugs to penetrate. The method was used to screen a library of single-gene deletions in Escherichia coli and identified 102 genes with unknown functions that likely impact biogenesis. One of these, Ely (YC), was found to play a role in metabolism of the lipid used for biogenesis of the cell wall and other surface polysaccharides. Further analysis of Ely and other hits is expected to reveal new information about biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and vulnerabilities for drug targeting. The screening method is adaptable to other organisms to study biogenesis of different envelope architectures. Understanding biogenesis is key to combating resistance, as many drugs are ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria. Recent progress has been made in identifying essential biogenesis machineries, but many aspects remain poorly characterized, including regulatory strategies for construction of the envelope layers. Study of these factors may reveal new mechanisms for assembly and potential drug targets. The discovery of Ely as a biogenesis factor validates the screening approach. Its functions in lipid metabolism are consistent with data, including role in Und production or recycling. Given Und's central role in pathways of extracellular polysacchar, E's roles are important for understanding biogenesis.
Researchers have been using various techniques to study dynamical processes in biology, each revealing unique aspects of the system. However, integrating heterogeneous datasets into a comprehensive view of multivar dynamics remains a challenge. A semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to fuse datasets, exploiting intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional data. This approach was applied to a dataset of Drosophila pattern formation, resulting in a continuous trajectory showing joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. The method can be adapted to other imaging modalities and serves as a starting point for further analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.

A semi-supervised solutions were computed for each pixel and channel, combining labeled and unlabeled datasets. The result is a multivar trajectory for joint dynamics of tissue and molecular components within the regulatory network, patterning the DV axis of the embryo. A dataset of 100 images was used, revealing spatial position of nuclei and distribution of patter network components. Pairwise similarities between images were computed using common channels to apply the semi-supervised approach to fusion.

The task of synthesizing multivar dynamics from heterogeneous datasets is non-trivial due to limitations of imaging live and fixed tissues. Approaches have been discussed in physics and social sciences, but systematic methods are lacking. This study addresses imaging of developing tissues, where patterns are established by complex networks. The task was posed as a semi-supervised problem, obtaining a closed-form expression for estimated variables using harmonic extension. Reconstructed trajectories provide basis for mechanistic studies of multivar processes responsible for reproducible pattern formation.
Research on snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of classes PI, PII, and PIII was conducted to investigate their tissue localization and ability to hydrolyze basement membrane components in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PII and PIII SVs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillaries to a higher extent than PI SV, which showed a more widespread distribution in tissue. Patterns of hydrolysis of lamin, type collagen, and nidogen in vivo differed among the three SVs, while they showed similar degradation of type IV collagen, indicating its critical role in microessel destabilization and hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of exudate showed similarities and differences between SV actions, with PI showing higher proteolysis of extracellular components and fibrin, while PII and P SVs had higher intracellular proteins. The study provides clues on mechanisms of SV-induced microvascul damage and hemorrhage.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the homeotic genes are arranged on the chromosome in the order of the body segments they affect, with posterior genes repressing anterior genes. However, this posterior rule is qualified by abdominal-A (ab-A) and abdominal-B (Abd-B) interaction. In animals lacking Abd-B, ectopic expression of ab-A is seen in the epidermis of the eighth segment, but not the nervous system. Repression in neuronal cells is accomplished by a 92 non-coding RNA, iab-8. This RNA produces a microRNA to repress ab-A and has a second, redundant mechanism acting cis. Transcription interference with ab-A promoter is the likely mechanism. The i-8 interferes with ab enhancer, which must lie downstream of i-6 breakpoint, as ab-A is derepressed in PS CNS embryos homozygous for this. The ab-A promoter is the likely target of interference, as major site of i-8 lies 1.1 kb upstream initiation of ab-A and i-8 transcript continues past poly site. Embryos with strong ab-A misexpression in CNS of 8th segment suggest i-8 can repress ab on chromosome it transcribed from. Control for haploinsufficiency i-8, Δmi-8/D9 deletion tested, removing entire bithor complex, shows no ab-A misexpression. Two mechanisms i8 repress ab-A: i8 miRNA acting trans and repressive acting cis. Rearrangements truncating i-8 near start cause derepression ab in CNS of 8 segment, same as Df3 homozygotes. Same ab spread into CNS seen Fab deletion removing i-8 promoter. Focus on i-8ncRNA, several lines suggest 90-long unit between-B and-A, likely start within i8 region. RNA-in hybridizations detect RNA in 8 and 9 segments.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms underlying patterns of focal seizures, specifically low-amplitude fast (LAF) and high-amplitude (HAS) oscillations, using a computational model of neocortical tissue. They validated the model with clinical recordings of focal seizures and found that the two patterns arise from different mechanisms. LAF is initiated by localized patches of activity that invade surrounding tissue over time, whereas HAS is a global transition to a seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by an increase in excitability of surrounding tissue that does not generate seizures but supports seizure activity when initiated. The difference in tissue excitability explains clinically reported differences in surgical outcomes. The model demonstrates how changes in excitability can be elucidated using stimulation. The study suggests excitability of surrounding the seizure core plays a role in onset and outcome.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZES-4 in maize that plays a crucial role in the process of pollen tube burst and sperm release during fertilization in flowering plants. ZES-4 is produced by the female gametophyte and accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of the syner cells, which are released during fertilization. Using RNA knockdown and synthetic Z-4 proteins, the team found that Z-4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-specific manner. Pollen plasma depolarization occurs immediately after Z-4 application, and channel experiments suggest a role of K+ influx in the tube rupture mechanism. The team discovered the intrinsic K+ channel K1 as a direct target of Z4. Following Z4 application, K1 opens at physiological potentials and closes after wash. The researchers propose that vesicles containing Z4 are released from syner cells upon male-female gamophyte signaling, and subsequent interaction between Z4 and K1 results in channel opening and K+ influx, leading to water uptake and osmotic burst. The species-specific activity of polymorphic Z4 indicates the mechanism represents a prezygotic barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants.
Researchers have developed a targeted oncolytic herpes virus, RM249, that specifically infects and kills cancer cells expressing high levels of the HER2 protein, which is overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers. In a preclinical study, RM249 was administered systemically to mice with disseminated tumors that mimic the spread of cancer to the peritoneum in women. Mice implanted with human ovarian SK-OV-3 cells developed progressive peritoneal carcinosis, mimicking the fatal condition in advanced patients. RM administration strongly inhibited carcinosis, with 60% of mice free from peritone diffusion and 95% reduction in total neoplastic nodules. Intraperitone metastases are common in breast cancer, RM administration inhibited growth of ovarian metastases in HER+DA-MB-453 cells and brain metastases were also reduced. RM effectively reduced growth of ovarian and breast disseminated carcinomas in the peritone cavity. SK-O-3 and M-453 cells are resistant to trastuzumab, but RM is effective against HER2 truzab-resistant cells, an important for clinical application. Previously, RM showed anti-tumor activity against subcut-injected human ovarian cells, this study evaluated activity against intraperitoneal cancer. RM administered effectively inhibited peritone dissemination of HER+ ovarian and breast carcinomas.
Researchers have identified Sfi, a conserved component of centrosomes, as the first cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. They found that reducing Cdk phosphorylation of S1 by changing its phosphorylation sites to non-phosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle bodies (SPBs, centrosomes) and inappropriate SP duplication during mitosis. Cells also display defects in bipolar assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. Phosphorylation of S1 by Cdk has a dual function in promoting SP separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SP duplication. Additionally, the protein phosphatase C14 has a converse role in activating, likely dephosphorylation of S1. The study supports the model that Cdk phosphorylation of S1 is required for SP separation and block SP duplication. After SP duplication, Cdk phosphorylates at least S1-terminal residues, allowing SP separation and bipolar formation during mitosis.
HIV-1 protein Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating viral replication during acute infection by exploiting proliferating CD4+ T cells in vivo. Previous studies have shown that V causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-1-infected cells in vitro, and is conserved in transmitted/founder HIV-1 and primate lentiviruses related to HIV-1. However, direct evidence in vivo has not been shown. Using a humanized mouse model, V causes G2 cell arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR+ CD+ T cells, mainly regulatory Tregs, resulting in T depletion and enhanced virus production during infection. V-dependent replication and T depletion observed in C5ropic but not Xropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting effects dependent on coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation observed in Cropic wild-type but not V-deficient HIV-infected humanized mice. Treatment with denileukin difox (DD) to deplete Tregs showed massive activation/proliferation of memory cells compared to untreated. This activation/prolifer enhanced C5 in memory CD+ cells and made them susceptible to Cropic wild-type HIV-1 than V-deficient virus. Results suggest V takes advantage of proliferating C5 CD+ cells enhancing viremia Cropic HIV-1. Tregs in higher cycling state than other subsets, appear vulnerable to V during HIV-1 infection.
Researchers conducted a 15-year longitudinal study on the genetic structure and transmission dynamics of Plasium vivax in South Korea using microsatellite DNA markers. They analyzed 14 microsatellite loci from 163 isolates collected from 1994 to 2008 and found a decrease in linkage disequilibrium (LD) levels and genetic differentiation between successive populations. A Bayesian analysis suggested a drastic genetic change in the Korean population occurred between 2002 and 2003. Although relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may influence population structure, results indicate introduction of P. viv from other sources, possibly North Korea during 200 and 2003. The study highlights the effectiveness of molecular epidemiology using microsat DNA for assessing population and transmission dynamics, aiding elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas.
Researchers investigated the role of splicing-competent introns in regulating promoter directionality of transcription in eukaryotes. They employed strand-specific transcription run-on (TRO) analysis to show that the presence of an intron favors transcription of mRNA over antisense transcripts from the promoter. Mutation of the 5' or 3' splice site reversed promoter direction, indicating that the entire splicing-competent intr regulates direction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed recruitment of termination factors near the promoter in the presence of an intr, but not in its absence. Removal of intr or mutation of splice sites affected termination factor localization. The authors previously demonstrated intr-mediated transcription enhancement depends on gene looping, and now show looping is crucial for termination factor recruitment in the promoter-prox region of intr-containing genes. In a looping-defective mutant, despite normal splicing, termination factors for poly(A)-dependent transcription were compromised, accompanied by loss of direction. They propose that intr-dependent looping places termination factors near the promoter for antisense transcription termination, conferring direction.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor, ZBED, derived from a domesticated transposon, which regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in the IGF2 intron 3 abrogates a repressor binding site, leading to a 3-fold upregulation of IGF in skeletal muscle, affecting muscle size, heart, and fat deposition. ZBED is specific to placental mammals and silencing it in mouse C2C myoblasts affects IGF expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing identified 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the established IGF site. Genes associated with ZBED sites show significant enrichment in development and transcription regulation. ZBED's effects in mutant pigs and silenced C2C mylasts, sequence conservation, nucleolar localization, broad distribution, and target genes with essential functions suggest its importance in placental development, proliferation, and growth. ZBED binds to IGF, repressing its expression in skeletal muscle and C2 cells. Genes associated with neurogenesis are overrepresented despite using C2 mylasts. Transcript analysis is required to assess Z6's importance for these targets. Disrupting Z6 and IGF interaction leads to 3-fold IGF upregulation in muscle and altered body composition, consistent with increased I2 in pigs. Silencing Z6 increases proliferation, myotube formation, and wound healing in C2 cells. Z's chromatin interaction and transcription is likely from ancestral transase.
Researchers have used next-generation sequencing technology to study the RNA editing process in rhes macaque, a close relative of humans, and identified 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions. They verified 96.6% of these sites in coding regions and 97.5 in non-coding regions, demonstrating the feasibility of their experimental paradigm. The study found that adenosine deamination is associated with A-to-G editing sites flanked by ADAR substrates, and AD sequence and expression are relevant in determining editing variance across sites and tissue types. Some editing sites showed decreased divergence, suggesting evolutionary constraint maintaining double-stranded structure. This complements the "tinkering" model of functional site origination. The rhes mac editome highlights RNA regulation in primate evolution and provides a framework for understanding editing in humans.
Researchers investigated how observers decode sensory responses in a two-alternative visual discrimination tasks, where they found a new perceptual bias that affects the representation of spatial frequencies. The study used spectrally filtered noise to induce an asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequencies, mainly affecting those irrelevant to the task. However, a significant shift in perceived frequency was observed, indicating that observers evaluate a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of alternatives. In the experiment, gratings were presented at high contrasts, corresponding to 84% correct detection thresholds in broadband noise, and performance was high with steep psychometric functions, suggesting decisions based on vertical frequency. The study differs from traditional psychophysical models of visual encoding gratings in noise, as it assumes noise changes the average response, not just variability. Grating detectability and discriminability were measured in filtered noise, showing noise alters perception of spatial frequency. Low-pass noise decreased perceived frequency, while high-pass increased it.
Researchers have discovered that Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs (piRNAs) are autonomously transcribed, meaning they can be expressed independently without the need for a long polycistronic RNA precursor. A 21 nucleotide (nt) piRNA sequence and a ∼50nt upstream motif are sufficient for expression, with the motif acting as a promoter to specify which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in which germ line. Over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germ line, suggesting these populations have evolved independently. The core motif encodes information for germline-specific expression, with a single nucleotide position directing differential germl enrichment. Synthetic 21 RNAs were autonomously expressed from minimal transgenic cassettes consisting of the 8 core motif, ∼nt intervening spacer, 21 RNA, and ∼100 flanking genomic context. The organization of endogenous piRNA loci is dispensable for robust piRNA expression, suggesting each 21 RNA locus encodes necessary information for independent transcription.
Brucella species replicate within host cells in the form of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles. The mechanisms by which the bacteria are sequestered into vacoles and obtain a continuous membrane supply for replication remain elucidated. During Bruc infection, the IRE pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was activated in a time-dependent manner, and COI vesicle components Sar, Sec23, and Sec24 were upregulated. A marked accretion of ER-derived vacoles was observed around replicating bacteria using microscopy and electron microscopy. A novel host factor, Y1, was identified for activation of the IRE pathway in response to tunic treatment and infection with B. abort. Y is responsible for phosphorylation of I through high assembly of Ire molecules at exit (E) under UP conditions. Y-knockdown cells abort failed to generate ER-derived vacoles and remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Results indicate activation the IRE pathway and formation ER-derived vacoles critical for abort to establish replication, and Y indispensable for these processes. Autagy proteins Atg and WI, but not D, required biogenesis ER-derived membrane compartments.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBS) and carnation Italian ring spot virus (CIR) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the viral replication compartment. The function of V34 is critical for TBS replication, suggesting that PI(3) phosphoinoside is utilized by TBS for building the replication compartment. The expression of V34 and abundance of PI(3 is increased in the presence of tombusiral proteins, leading to efficient TBS replication. Overexpression of PI3 phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibits TBS replication on peroxomal membranes and CIR on mitochondrial membranes. Purified PI phosphatase reduces TBS assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI with antibody or probe reveals enrichment of PI in the replication. V34 is recruited into replication through interaction with p33 protein. Gene analysis in yeast unravels TBS requires vesicle transport of V34. Absence of V34, TBS cannot recruit Rab-positive endosomes, providing PE-rich membranes for TBS replication. V34 and PI are needed for stability of p33 protein, degraded by 26 proteasome when PI abundance is decreased by V34 inhibitor.
Researchers conducted a study in Iqu, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypt mosquitoes on deng virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies. The study aimed to compare artificial and natural feeding methods of DENV infection and dissemination in mosquitoes for a field-based epidemiological study. Between 2011 and 2015, participants aged 5 years or older with 5 days of fever were enrolled from clinic and neighborhood studies on deng in Iitos. Wild, laboratory-reared Aedes aegyti were fed on febrile individuals or blood collected from participants, either untreated or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination. A total 58 participants with vireas from 1.3 × 102 to 2.9 × 106 focus-forming units per mL of serum participated in one or more feeding methods. DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-ED feeding, however, lower for mosquitoes fed on blood with no additive. Relative direct feeding showed variation following indirect-ED than indirect-no feeding. Dissemination rates were similar across all methods. No differences detected D infection or dissemination in mosquitoes fed on participants with different deng severity. The study demonstrates direct and indirect feeding for field-based studies vector competence. Direct feeding is preferable in terms of ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
Researchers investigated why some patients respond differently to chemotherapy drugs that target topoisomerase II, an enzyme involved in DNA replication. They used Caenorhabditis elegans, a model organism, and found that strains vary in sensitivity to these drugs. An unbiased genetic approach identified a single amino acid substitution, methionine to glutamine, in topoisomerase II (TOP-2), as the cause of this variation. This substitution increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and the drug etoposide, leading to increased genomic instability. The affected residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is a difference between human topoisomerase isoforms, hTOIα and hIβ. This difference influences cytotoxicity of topois II poisons in human cell lines, explaining why hIα and hβ are differentially affected by poisons. The study demonstrates the utility of C elegans in understanding genetics of drug responses.
Researchers studied the genetics of lifespan in long-lived rodents, specifically the African mole rat, to gain insights into mechanisms determining mammalian lifespan. They obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and scanned for evolutionary branches associated with enhanced longevity, identifying 250 positively selected genes (PSGs). In the liver of long-lived mole rats and short-lived rats, PSGs showed an expression pattern fitting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. PSGs were enriched for genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway: translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, PSGs included RHEB, a regulator of mTOR, and IGF, central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as unknown aging-associated genes like RBL, AM2, PSM1, and GER. Protein modeling suggested functional consequences of amino acid changes under selection. The study provides a resource to mechanistically link genes and amino acids to aging and lifespan determination. A systematic scan of PSG on African moleat and rodent branches showed higher resolution of positive selection than previous studies. Consistent with observed PSG expression patterns, lower expression of related genes and pharmacological inhibition was associated with longer lifespan in worms, killifish, and mice. mTOR regulates inflammatory and immune responses. PSG are associated with expression changes in long and short-lived rodents, fitting antagonistic pleiotropy theory. Gene ontology analysis showed significant downregulation in long-lived and upregulation in short, fitting antagonistic pleiotropy. PSG enriched terms cover processes regulated by mTOR, including translation, autagy, and cellular respiration.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to control the Aedes aegypti mosquito population by exploiting the Wolbachia endosymbiont to produce sterile males and females with reduced vector competence. Aedes aegypt transfection (ARP-M) was generated by introducing Wolbach in the ARP line, which had previously replaced AlA and AlB Wolbach with the P strain. Various infection and fitness parameters were studied by comparing ARP, ARP, and wild-type Aegypt sharing the same genetic background. The competence of ARP to chikunya, dengue, and Zika viruses was evaluated in comparison with ARP. ARP showed 100% maternal inheritance of Mel and P Wolbach. Survival, fecundity, and fertility did not differ between the Aegpt lines. Crosses between ARP males and wild-type females were infertile regardless of age, while egg hatch in reverse increased from 0 to 17 with wild males aging 3 to 17. When competing with wild males for females, ARP males induced sterility significantly higher than expected (Fried index 1.71 instead 1). Wolbach density in ARP females was about 15 fold higher in ARP, mostly due to Mel. This corresponded to reduced competence for chikunya and deng viruses (5 and 0 rates at 14 and 21 post-infection with ARP females. Results regarding Zika did not highlight differences ARP and ARP, however, none tested ARP females transmitted ZV. These findings promote the exploitation of Wolia to suppress wild-type Aeg populations.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify peptide-mediated interactions between proteins using high-resolution 3D structures. These interactions occur when a globular protein domain recognizes a linear peptide from another protein, creating a small contact interface. Peptides are often found in unstructured regions of proteins and contain a consensus motif complementary to their binding partner's surface. Current methods exploit their tendency to occur in disordered regions, but this study focuses on how they adopt a defined structure upon binding. Analysis of 3D structures found the peptide's structure is characteristic of the consensus, helping identify peptides that don't match established patterns. Motifs tend to be stretched and elongated, unlike other peptides of the same length. A Support Vector Machine was implemented using features and structure information to scan 3D protein interactions, identifying unnoticed interactions. Derived patterns were compared to established motifs and domains, and cross-validated in four organism interactomes, finding 64 new domain-peptide interactions, 6,000 total, suggesting molecular details of binding.
Researchers conducted a study on 49 adults with environmental enteropathy (EE) in Lus, Zambia, using confocal endoscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of intestinal biops, and correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zinc uptake. The study aimed to define mechanisms of impaired barrier function in EE and explore protective mechanisms. Confocal images showed ubiquitous intestinal epithelial defects, predominantly at villi tips, corresponding with leakage in vivo. Multivariate analysis showed circulating LPS correlated with cell shedding (β=0.83, P=0.035) and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (β=-0.13, P=0.007). Zinc uptake was attenuated in 30/47 (64%) individuals, reduced by HIV, but correlated with GL-2 (β=2.72, P=0.03). Transcript analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins. Epithelial defects are probably sites of bacterial translocation, with increased epithelial surface area increasing burden. GL-2 and other peptides may play a role in mucosal protection in EE. Biomarkers of microbial translocation and inflammation (L, LBP, CRP, CD163, GL-2, α-antitps) were compared with confocal and zinc uptake to explore barrier defects and identify potential biomarkers. Transcript analysis found severe enteropathy associated with reduced DMT expression, contributing to zinc uptake, especially supra-physiological doses.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of superinfection exclusion (SIE), where viruses block re-infection of host cells by the same or similar viruses, in turnip crinkle virus (TCV). They found that SIE in TCV is determined by protein p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by the virus. p28 expressed from TCV exerted strong S to different TCV replicon. Transiently expressed p28, delivered with or ahead of TCVon, largely recapitulated this repressive activity. p28-mediated SIE was enhanced by C-terminally fused epitope or proteins but weakened by N-terminal modifications and inversely correlated with p ability to complement p-defective TCVon. p28 in S-positive cells formed large punctate inclusions aggregating non-coales S-defective yet replication-compet p mutant. The results support a model that TCV S is caused by multimer p complexes intercepting fresh p monomers from superfect genomes, abolishing superfect replication. This mechanism could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offer novel antiviral targets.
Researchers investigated whether co-administration of plasmid DNA encoding IL-15 (IL-15) could improve long-term protection against Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease. Mice were immunized with plasm DNA encoding Trypanosoma cruzi transialase (TS) alone or with or without IL-15. Immune responses were measured with TS-specific IFN-γ ELISA, serum IgG ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining (IF-γ, TN-α, IL-2), tetramer staining, and CFSE dilution assays, and protection against lethal challenge at 1-6 months post-vaccination. Mice immunized with TS alone developed TS-specific IF-γ responses and survived lethal challenge within 3 months. Addition of IL-15 to TS vaccination did not alter T responses or protection during early post-vacc period. However, mice vaccinated with both TS and IL-15 challenged 6 months postacc were more protected against lethal T cruzi than TS alone (p<0.05). Improved protection correlated with higher TS-specific IF-γ producing CD8+ T cells detected 6 months postimmun. TS-specific T cells expanded better in vitro-stimulation. Addition IL-15 during vaccination improved long-term T survival, memory cell expansion, and long-term protection against T cruzi.
Researchers have identified a Cull-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, CRLWDR1, that controls the abundance of the Polo-like kinase TbPL in Trypanosoma brucei. TbPL plays a crucial role in basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. The complex consists of Cull4, a DNA-binding protein TbDB1, and WD-repeat protein WDR. WDR interacts with TbPL through its C-terminal PEST motif and N-terminal WD40 motif binds to TbDB. Depletion of W1 inhibits bilobe duplication and basal segregation, disrupts flagum attachment and detaches the new flagum. Consistent with its role in PL degradation, W1 causes excessive accumulation of PL in basal and bil, leading to phosphorylation of Cent2 in bil at late cell stages. This identifies WDR as a PL receptor in Cull-D1 ubiquitin ligase for degrading PL in basal and bil after G/S cell transition, promoting bil duplication, basal separation, and flagum adhesion.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3 in the innate immune system, specifically in mediating antimicrobial responses. Mice lacking DDX3 in the hematopoietic system showed altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen and were highly susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes infection. This was due to decreased effector cell availability and impaired cytokine synthesis. The study suggests DDX3's contribution to innate immunity and may underlie sex differences in resistance to microbes and inflammatory disease. DDXX deficiency impacted the immune system through hematopoiesis and regulation of the response to Lister infections. RNA-Seq analysis of L-infected macrophages showed DDXX altered the transcriptome, with sex-dependent effects on gene expression. DDX3 regulates IF-I transcription in infected cells and intracellular pathogens. DDX belongs to the DEAD RNA helic superfamily, involved in RNA metabolism, transcription, splicing, decay, and translation.
A computational model of the insect pherone transduction cascade in male moth olfactory neurons is presented. The model accounts for pre-effector processes, including pherone molecule translocation from air to sensillum, deactivation, and interaction with receptors, and G-protein effector activation, and focuses on post-eff processes. These involve production and degradation of second messengers (IP3 and DAG), opening and closing of ionic channels (IP-gated Ca2+, DAGated cation, Ca2-g Cl-, and Ca2 voltageated K+), and Ca2 extrusion. The network is regulated by modulators (protein C and Ca2-calmodulin) exerting feedback on effector channels. The model simulates evolution of chemical species and currents and membrane response to single pherone stimulation of various intensities. Parameters were fitted to experimentally measured receptor potentials at pherone doses. The model captures main features of dose-response curves, wide range, rising, and falling times, and reproduces second messenger kinetics. Two types of depolarizing channels play different roles at low and high pherone concentrations, DAGated cation channel at low, Ca-gated Cl at middle and high. Predictions and future developments are proposed.
Researchers investigated how the tumor suppressor protein p53 responds to cellular stress by binding to specific DNA elements and activating gene expression. They mapped p53 binding and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in untreated and doxorubicin-treated human lymphoblast cells. The study examined relationships between p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3me, chromatin accessibility (DNase hypersensitivity), ENCODE chrom states, p53 sequence, and evolutionary conservation. Inducible p-regulated genes were associated with steady-state chromatin status. Highly inducible genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTCF binding. p53 sequences in different chrom contexts showed weaker pREs in open, stronger in enhancers and repressed chrom. p occupancy correlated with similarity to pRE consensus but inversely with existing accessibility and conservation. Occupancy of transposable element (TE) pREs was higher and correlated with stronger sequences, particularly ML1, LTRB, and Mer TEs. However, binding was not associated with adjacent gene activation. Occupied pRE in L-like TEs displayed negative phylo scores and altered H3me and DHS. The study highlights interaction between chromatin and pRE in transactivation. The p response appears tuned via evolutionary processes leading to repression or utilization of pRE from primate elements.
Researchers have explored a specific motif in bacterial two-component signaling systems, where a single histidine kinase (HK) phosphorylates two response regulator (RR) proteins. They found that this motif allows for rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a "sink" for the other, and implements a sigmoidal signal response. Mathematical analysis revealed conditions for sigmoidal response and identified key parameters controlling threshold and sensitivity of the signal curve. Experimentally, they reconstituted the HK-RR motif in Sinorhizobium meli chemotaxis and measured the signal curve, finding sigmoidality controlled by RR presence and an auxiliary protein binding to HK, yielding Hill coefficients above 7. This motif enables tunable switch-like processing in bacteria and yeast, providing a basis for developing threshold devices in synthetic biology.
Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the heterogeneity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells' response to salt stress. They found that individual cells within a population exhibit significant variation in stress tolerance, and that this heterogeneity is present both before and after stress exposure. A subset of cells decouples ribosomal protein gene expression from environmental stress response, correlated with cell cycle but not ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging revealed coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors, including Msn2, Dot6, S1, and Hog1. Transcript analysis suggests cells maintain a filter against decoupled bursts of factor activation but mount a coordinated response upon stress, even in unstressed cells. This study provides new insights into heterogeneity in yeast stress response, but many questions remain. Single-cell RNA sequencing and transcription factor profiling revealed variable activation of Environmental Stress Response (ES) and condition-specific regulators after stress, and heterogeneity in ES activation in unstressed cells due to coordinated and discordant induction of ES regulators. Targets of the general stress-responsive factor M2 often behave coordinately in cells, suggesting activation of entire regulon in absence of added stress. Cell-to-cell variation in M2 activation could explain heterogeneity in tolerance, but unclear if correlates with broader transcript changes, magnitude in unstressed mimics stressed, or correlates with cell phase.
Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in various organs and tissues, including the male reproductive system of mice. Through fine needle aspiration cytology and histological analysis, it was found that T. brucei accumulates in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis, but not in the lumen of epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the test. This indicates that the majority of parasites are not in immune-privileged sites. Instead, they are associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, degeneration, and tissue rupture of epididym ducts, which may be related to reduced fertility. The male reproductive system is an important site for trypanosome accumulation, but the testis has virtually no parasites. The majority of parasites are located in the stroma of epididym and surrounding epidid adipose tissue, not protected by tissue barriers. T. bruce infection is associated with moderate to marked inflammation of reproductive organs in mice, both tissues infiltrated by parasites and test. Inflammation is associated with disruption of blood-testis and blood-epidym barriers at later stages of infection. In mice, T. bruce infection accumulates in male organs since day 6 post-infection, with epidid adipose and stroma epididym most parasitized, epidym showing increase parasite density 105 per organ at late stages. This is similar to gonadal adipose previously found.
Researchers investigated the plasticity of the chemoreceptor repertoire in Drosophila melanogaster to understand how chemosensation is regulated in response to environmental changes. They used customized cDNA microarrays to analyze chemore gene expression at different developmental stages, sexes, reproductive states, and social contexts. Results showed that chemore genes in clusters undergo independent transcriptional regulation, with distinct subgroups sensitive to reproductive and social interactions. Exposure to opposite sex odor altered transcript abundance of chemore genes, different from those sensitive to physical contact with same or opposite sex. Covariance analysis revealed 20 small, biologically relevant modules of correlated transcripts, enabling fine-tuning of chemore expression in ecologically and physiologically relevant conditions.
Studies of human trisomies have revealed a significant relationship between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction at meiosis I or II. Specifically, failure to recombine or recombination events located near or far from the centromere have been linked to human trisies. Immunofluorescence methodology can identify abnormal crossover configurations by examining meiotic recombination in human females. This study analyzed crossover proteins (e.g., ML1) in human oocytes to analyze nondjunction-prone chromosomes and characterize genome-wide recombination in females. Results show ML1 foci lower than predicted genetic analysis, but localization conforms to crossover protein pattern. Individual chromosome studies provide evidence for "vulnerable" crossover in oocytes, consistent with nondjunction events in adult oocytes.

Meiotic errors generate many chromosome abnormalities in humans, most originating in first division oocyte. Molecular correlates of abnormalities are disturbances in recombination linked to human tris of maternal origin. This study evaluated ML1 as crossover marker in females and achmate and suboptimal patterns, feature human meiosis. Results summarize 103 prophase oocytes from 31 ovarian samples. Direct analyses crossover fetal oocytes reveal "ulnerable configurations consistent tromic data (e.g., chromosome 16 distal exchanges, chromosome 21 proximal dist exchanges, achmate). If true, recombination patterns tris reflected ML1 chromosomal oocytes. Not all clear, e.g., no "spikes" dist or proximal ML1 chromosome 21, despite proximal dist exchanges tris 21.
Research on the epidemiological consequences of pre-exposure to vector saliva, specifically from blood-feeding arthropods like mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks, reveals that immune responses elicited by pre-exposure can alter disease progression in hosts who later become infected. Pre-exposure has been reported to both exacerbate and limit symptoms, depending on the system in question, with implications for recovery. To explore how pre-exposure affects vector control, a model of vector-borne disease was developed, showing that abundance of pre-exposed hosts increases when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality. If pre-ex leads to rapid clearance, increasing mortality may achieve greater control, but if it prolongs duration, e.g., through symptomatic cases unlikely to be treated, control can increase total infected. Rising infections may go unnoticed without active surveillance detecting subclinical individuals, providing reservoirs for transmission and long-term consequences. Sensitivity analysis suggests mitigating negative consequences through integrated management. The immunological and clinical consequences of pre-exposure are largely uncharted for other vector-parasite combinations, underscoring the need to quantify modulate recovery and transmission rates in vectororne diseases. Mathematical models were developed to determine pre-ex effects on infection dynamics and interventions. A significant proportion of individuals are preexposed to vector saliva, with 23% demonstrating immune response to sand fly saliv molecules. Experimental evidence suggests immunological effects wane over time; if pre-ex wanes fast, control is not predicted to increase infected. The contribution of preex hosts to transmission is key to estimating impact on epidemiology, predicting adverse consequences can be avoided if transmission from preex hosts is smaller than naïve. Classic models ignore pre-ex effects, predicting heightened mortality effectively controls vector disease by reducing abundance, bites, and probability surviving extrinsic period.
Researchers investigated the impact of the host immune system on the expression of Leishmania amazonensis proteins by comparing the proteomes of amastigotes from BAL/c and BAL nude mice. Leish is a disease affecting 12 million people worldwide, with 2 million new cases annually, and Leish amazonensis is a major agent in Brazil, causing localized and diffuse cutaneous leishmanias. The study aimed to understand how the host response affects Leish phenotype and virulence. The proteomes of amigotes from BAL/c and BAL nude mice were analyzed using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Among 44 differentially expressed proteins, some related to oxidative stress and proteases were found, including known virulence factors oligopeptase and tryparedin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting T cells restrain post-transl modifications in BAL/c mice. On the other hand, an iso of H70 was increased in amotes from BAL mice. This study may identify potential virulence factors and ways of regulating expression.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) plays a crucial role in immunoglobulin gene diversification by deaminating cytosines in DNA, leading to somatic hypermutation, class recombination, and gene conversion. However, A is highly mutagenic and causes genomic instability, contributing to chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. Research shows that A is cell cycle-regulated, with degradation occurring more slowly in G1 phase than S or G2/M phase. Mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity alter A stability and abundance. Enforced nuclear localization of A in G1 phase accelerates somatic hypermutation and class recombination, while compromising viability in S2/M phase. A derivatives that accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability are potential tools for gene engineering and mutagenesis. Cell cycle regulation of A stability determines the cellular response to A-initiated DNA damage. A degradation is limited by proteasomal and CRM-dependent export, and catalytic activity can be improved by site mutations, but also stimulate translocations and compromise viability. Low A levels in G2 may lead to elevated levels in G1, as seen in A-merryCD1 transductants. A Ser is a site of regulation, phosphorylation downregulating SH and CSR.
Researchers have developed a method to analyze how microbes, specifically the bacterium Clostridium phyfermentans, break down plant biomass into simpler sugars. This method combines carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAzyme) assays, RNA sequencing, and anaerobic growth to understand how the bacterium ferments various plant components such as glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabin. The study found that the bacterium ferments these polysaccharides with different efficiencies and prioritizes certain substrates. RNA sequencing revealed how the bacter responds to polyscharides by upregulating specific groups of CAymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize constituent sugars. Fifty-six upregulated CAymes were purified and shown to degrade polysacides by multiple enzymes, often from the same family but with divergent specificities and localizations. These enzymes were tested in combination to identify synergies between acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This research advances understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass.
In Sierra Leone, three rounds of annual mass drug administration (MDA) were conducted in 12 onchocerciasis-endemic districts from 2008-2010 with good geographic and drug coverage. A mid-term assessment in 2011 showed the impact on lymphatic filariasis (LF) in these districts. The prevalence of microfilaria (mf) in 12 districts decreased from 2.6% (95%CI: 2.3-3%) to 0.3 (95%:0.19-0.47), a 88.5% decrease (p=0.000). Four districts had a 100% decrease in mf prevalence: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono (p=0.001, 0.025, 0.085, 0.000) and seven districts had reductions between 70-95% (p=0.000, 0.060 0.001 0.014 0.000 0 0.002 Bombali, Bonthe, Kail, Kambia, Koinugu, Portoko and Tonili). Pehun had a baseline prevalence of 0% which was maintained. Bomb still had a prevalence ≥1% (1.58, 95:0.80-3.09) and had the highest baseline 6.9 (95:5.3-8.8). Overall mean mf density after MD was 17.59/ml (95:15.64-19.55) among positive individuals 65.4 decrease from baseline 50.9 (95:40.25-61.62) and 0.05 (95:0.03-0.08) for the entire population 96.2 from 1.32 (95:1-1.65).
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the inner workings of microbial communities in various environments, including the human gut and oceans. A key step in exploring such data is identifying dependencies between community members, commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, compositional data generated by these techniques can produce unreliable results due to relative gene or species fractions rather than absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome, we show compositional effects can be widespread: many correlations among taxa can be artificial and true correlations may appear opposite. Community diversity modulates the severity of compos effects and a new approach, Spar, available at https://bitbucket.org/yonf/spar, estimates correlations from compositional data. To illustrate Spar's application, a network of interacting species across 18 human sites is inferred. Spar as reference, standard approach yields 3 spurious species interactions and misses 60% of true interactions in human microbiome data, with most errors in samples with lowest diversity.
Researchers investigated the role of lysozyme, a mucosal enzyme with antimicrobial properties, in the colonization of Streptococcus pneumoniae on the upper respiratory tract. They found that lyzyme's muridase activity, which hydrolyzes peptoglycan, is responsible for its antimicrobial effect. Two enzymes, Pgd and Ad, modify peptogly sites of Streptoc pneumonia, conferring resistance to lyzym in vitro. Experiments with wild-type and pgAdr mutant pneumoc in lysoe-sufficient (LM+) and deficient (LM-) mice showed that wild-type outcompeted mutant in LM+, but not LM- mice, highlighting the importance of resistance to lyzym's murid activity during mucosal colonization. Strains with single mutations in pg or Ad prevailed over wild-type in LM+ and LM- mice, indicating individual peogly modifications diminish fitness during colonization. The combination of peog modifications reduced fitness, but was outweighed by benefits of resistance to peog degrading activity lyzym. The study demonstrates the complex effects of pe modifications on bacterial growth and survival in different environments.
Dengue virus (DENV) is the most arthropod borne viral disease in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide, caused by four serotypes DENV-1 to 4. Brazil is responsible for 80% of DENV cases in the Americas, with 5,944,270 cases reported since introduction in 1986, including 21,596 hemorrhagic fever and 874 fatal cases. This study investigated the usefulness of NS1 capture as an alternative to detect DENV in tissue from confirmed fatal cases (n=23) in 2002 Brazil. 74 tissue specimens were available: liver (n=23), lung (n=14), kidney (n=4), brain (n=10), heart (n=2), skin (n=1), spleen (n=15), thym (n=3) and lymph (n=2). Three tests for NS1 capture were evaluated: Deng Early ELISA (Pan Diagnostics), Plat NS1 (Bio Laboratories) and NS1 Strip (Bio). Overall DENV diagnosis based on tissues by ELISA, Plat1 and NS Strip was 34.7% (8/23), 60.8 (14) and 91.3 (21) respectively. EL detected NS1 in 22.9 (17) of specimens and Plat NS in 45.9 (34). Highest sensitivity 78.3 (58) was achieved by Strip, with significant differences (p<0.05). Strip was most sensitive in liver (91.3), lung (71.4), kidney (100), brain (80), spleen (66.6) and thym (100) compared to EL assays. This study shows DENV NS capture as valuable postmortem confirmation.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis of 718 multiple myeloma (MM) cases from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's Compass Interim Analysis 9 study to investigate differences in genetic mutations between African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) patients. They used whole-exome sequencing and RNA sequencing to identify somatic mutations and correlated with self-reported race and ancestry. The study found significant differences in mutation frequencies between the two groups, with B7, BR3, and AUT2 showing higher frequencies in AA cases, which are involved in B-cell malignancies. TP53 and IRF4 mutations were more common in CA cases. This study is one of the most comprehensive WES and RNAseq analyses of MM in AA patients and highlights potential ancestry-related differences in myelogenesis. Three genes involved in B malignancy translocations are new candidates that may have been overlooked due to limited AA representation in previous genomic studies. The study emphasizes the need for deeper understanding of oncogenic processes in multi-ethnic cohorts to address disparities in incidence and outcomes among AA patients.
Researchers have studied the role of passenger mutations in cancer evolution, which are mutations that do not affect the reproductive rate of cancer cells. These mutations can provide information about the history of an individual cancer and serve as a molecular clock. They can also become targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment. The study analyzed the expansion of a population of cancer cells describing growth of primary or metastatic lesions. They looked at the process forward in time, calculating the probabilities and frequencies of successive mutations ordered by time of appearance. They computed the likelihood of evolutionary trees, informing the phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer in individual patients. They also looked backward in time, for a subclonal mutation estimating the number of cancer cells present when the mutation arose. They derived formulas for the expected number of subcl mutations of any frequency. Fitting the formula to sequencing data estimated the ratio of birth and death of cancer cells during early stages of clonal expansion. The ratio determines the shape of cancer's phylogen tree, which is star-shaped for fast growth and linear for slow. For a mutation with observed frequency in population, they asked how many cells were present when mutation arose. The answer varies with death-birth ratio, which changes from 0 to 0.99. Frequencies of first and most abundant passengers are influenced by mutation and death-birth ratio of cancer. If close to 1, several clonal passengers may not be present in first cell but collected during expansion. If 0.99, there are about 150 passengers in more than 1% cells. The formula can be fitted to data to determine the branching model of evolution and extract parameters. It was applied to colorectal cancer dataset, showing neutral evolution during clonal expansion. For close to 1, number of subcl with frequency 50 is equal to clonal collected during progression. Subtracting subcl with frequency 50 from all cl will estimate cl in first cell.
Polyglutamine (Q) expansion in exon 1 (N) of the huntingtin protein is linked to Huntington's disease. When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36-40, N1 can form amyloid aggregates similar to those associated with the disease. Experiments suggest that misfolding of monomeric N1 plays a role in length-dependent aggregation. Elucidating the misolding of N1 monomer can determine the mechanism of N aggregation and help develop strategies to inhibit aggregation. Flanking sequences surrounding the poly region play a critical role in determining structural rearrangement and aggregation of N. Molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric N with full flanking regions, missing polypro regions, and isolated poly peptide (Q were performed. Each construct studied with glutamine lengths 23, 36, 40, and 47. Poly peptides showed a positive correlation between probability to form β-rich state and expansion. Flanking regions of N affect probability to form β state compared to isolated Q. Polyline regions form poly II helices decrease probability of Q to form β state. Lengthening Q, first-terminal 17 residues more likely adopt β-conformation than α-helix. Molecular study provides insight into N misolding and elucidates role of flanking in aggregation.

The aggregation of N displays complicated behavior. Length-dependent misolding poly sequence in N monomer plays role in oligomerization and β-amyloid formation. Dynamics of monomeric N studied to illuminate aggregation mechanism and role of aggregates. Huntington disease associated with polyutamine expansion in hunting protein. Exon N of hunting protein contains poly region implicated pathogenic peptide. Increasing glut repeats in poly region N can fold into β-strand. Poly and flanking in N coupled in N folding misolding. Role of flanking in other polyut diseases debated. Model suggests aggregation initiated fl N region. Flanking misfold oligomers increase local poly concentration causes poly mis into protofils fatal fibrils.
Researchers have explored the distribution and diversity of CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindrom Repeats) loci, a defense mechanism used by bacteria and archaea to protect against foreign nucleic acids, in the human microbiome. Utilizing over 700 metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project, they developed a targeted assembly strategy to reconstruct CRPR arrays that whole-genome assemblies failed to identify. By recruiting known CRPR consensus sequences to reads from each dataset and assembling them into CRPR loci, unique spacer sequences were extracted for analysis. Novel CRPRs or CRPR variants were also identified in whole-genome assemblies. The study found CRPR distributions, including 64 known and 86 novel ones, to be largely site-specific. Detailed analysis of several CRPR loci, including novel ones, showed streptocococcal CRPRs in oral microbiomes with ~8,000 unique spacers shared across samples from the same individual and site, while different sites from the same individual shared fewer, and individuals almost none, indicating niche impact on CRPR evolution. The study demonstrates potential of CRPR in tracing rare species and virus exposure in individuals, highlighting the importance of CRPR characterization in microbiome ecology.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify light and temperature-entrained transcripts in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode model organism. They found that subsets of transcripts exhibit rhythmic expression with 24-hour periods, sustained under constant conditions, suggesting circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles drive gene expression, largely entraining non-overlapping sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel required for sensory transduction abolished light and temperature-entrained gene expression, indicating environmental cues act nonautonomously entrain circadian rhythms. The study demonstrates circadian-transcriptional rhythms in C elegans and suggests further analysis will provide information on the evolution and function of this biological clock. C elegans exhibits systemic responses to light and temperature, driving expression of many genes, with conserved clock homologs not exhibiting circadian rhythmicity at the mRNA level. Both light and temperature act as zeitgebers, entraining transcripts genome-wide. Circadian expression is regulated by environmental information received by a set of sensory neurons, similar to vertebrates, suggesting light and temperature may act nonautonomously entrain the clock in Cans. The findings imply Cans may utilize a timekeeping mechanism distinct from other animals. Temperature drives a larger set of genes than light, with genes in metabolism enriched in temperature-driven sets and circadian behaviors in locomotion and reproduction in both organisms. The TAX-2 cyclicotide channel is required to transduce light and temperature to the clock, demonstrating Cans has circadian entrained by light and temperature.
Researchers studied the RAD3 gene in yeast, a homolog of the human XPD gene, which encodes a helicase in the TFII complex involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Mutant alleles of RAD3 (rad-101 and rad-102) have defects in DNA repair and a hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotype. Previous studies showed the hyper-phenotype associated with rad-101 and rad-102 can be explained by persistent single-stranded DNA gaps converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. This study used a system to detect reciprocal mitotic recombination products and found rad-101 and rad-102 elevated reciprocal crossovers 100-fold. Mapping showed three-quarters of crosso reflect DSBS formed at same positions in sister chromatids (double-chromat breaks, DSBs) and remainder DSBS in single chromatids (singleid breaks, SCBs). Ratio DSBs to SC similar to spontaneous recombination in wild-type cells. Mapped 216 genomic alterations, including crosso, conversions, deletions, and duplications, and found significant association with regions of recombination and gamma-H2AX. Hotspots for deletions and duplications at IMA and H11 near end of chromosome XV. Comparison with spontaneous recombination events in wild-type suggests subset initiated by incomplete NER, DSBs not repaired by sisterchromatid recombination major source mitotic between homolog chromosomes.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, has a set of simple sequence repeats (SSR) that generate heterogeneous populations through slipped strand mispairing, facilitating adaptation to the changing host environment during persistent infection. A study reveals that an intergenic tract, via slipped mispair, operates as a rheostat to fine-tune expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin (SabA) promoter. T-tract variants in an isogenic strain show that tract length generates multiphas output from sab promoter, altering H. pylori binding to sial-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Analysis of post-infection clones shows tract length is highly variable in H. pylori, mirroring host-pathogen interplay where bacterium generates clones with best-fit phenotypes selected in host. In silico and in vitro analyzes reveal tract length affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, shifting axial alignment between promoter and UP elements. Additional H. pyl genes with tract similar to sab show variations modulate promoter output. This mechanism, mediated by promoter-prox SSR, provides alternative transcription regulation in bacteria with limited transacting factors.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade innate immune surveillance to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon epithelial differentiation. Members of the JAK/STAT family regulate the innate response, and HPV downregulate STAT1 to maintain stable viral episomes. STAT5, another member of this pathway, modulates the inflammatory response and controls cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. Studies show HPV7 activates STAT5 phosphorylation without altering total levels. Inhibition of STAT5 by pimide abolishes genome amplification and late expression in differentiating keratinocytes. In contrast, treatment of undifferentiated cells stably maintaining episomes has no effect on viral replication. Knockdown studies show STAT5 isoform is mainly responsible, mediated through ATM damage response, a downstream of STAT5, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) contributes to effects on ATM pathway. These findings identify a new mechanism where innate regulator STAT5 promotes viral replication through activation of DNA damage response.
Researchers in Nepal identified 13 immunogenic Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi antigens expressed in the biliary tract of chronic carriers in Kathmandu, Nepal. These antigens were not found in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area. The identified antigens included putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. YE (ST147), an uncharacterized protein with ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in screen. Responses to YE in patients with biliary tract S. Typhi were compared to those without S. Typhi, patients with tyoid fever, and healthy controls in tyoid area. 70% of chronic carriers, 0% of bile-negative controls, 0% of healthy Bangladeshis, and 12.5% Bangladeshis with tyoid had detectable anti-YE Ig in blood. Ig responses were also present. Further evaluation of YE and other antigens by IVAT could lead to improved diagnostic assays for asymptomatic S. Ty carriers. 

The study used in vivo antigen technology (IVAT) to identify host-pathogen interactions in biliary tract during S. Ty carriage. IV identifies humorally immunogenic antigens expressed in vivo, not in standard conditions. Thirteen S. Ty antigens were immunore in carriers but not healthy from tyoid area. The antigens included putative proteins, liproteins, and hemys-related. Y (ST147), uncharacter protein ATP-binding, gave responses in screen. Responses Y in patients with biliary S. Ty were compared to those without S. Ty, with tyoid, and healthy in ty area.70% chronic, 0 bile-negative,0 healthy, and 12.5 with tyoid had anti-Y in blood. Ig also present.
Researchers have identified a new epigenetic phenomenon called transactivation, where a non-functional alleles of a gene can reactivate the expression of a wild-type allele of the same gene that is silenced by heterochromatin. This occurs through the presence of homologous RNA and is affected by genes involved in post-transcriptional silencing. The study found that non-functional alleles of the white gene, unable to produce a coding transcript, can reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochatin. This phenomenon is heritable and relies on the presence of diffusible homologous RNA and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcription silencing. The mechanisms and features of transactivation differ from previously characterized epigen reprogramming events in paramutation, transduction, and transvection. In transactivation regions, transcribing RNAs unable to produce a full transcript can positively influence the transcription state of an homolog locus silenced by heterochatin. The presence of non-functional white alleles causes an increase in wmh transcript as well as opening in chromatin at the wm locus.
Researchers have identified Boophil, a multifunctional protease inhibitor from the midgut of the tick Rhipphalus microplus, which targets thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. Using amidolytic and surface plasmon resonance experiments, they found that Boophil behaves as a classical non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to chromogenic substrates, dependent on both exosite and catalytic sites. Inhibition is accompanied by blockade of platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot thrombin in vitro. Boophil also inhibits FXa, preventing activation, and kikrein activity, indicating it targets the contact pathway. Additionally, Boophil abates catheps G and plmin-induced platelet aggregation and affects elastase cleavage of Tissue Pathway Inhibitor (TFI). In vivo, Boophil inhibits carot artery occlusion triggered by Fe3 and promotes bleeding in mice. Through inhibition of several proteolytic cascades and cell activation, Boophil plays a role in maintaining midut environment low hemostasis and inflammatory response, allowing ticks to digest blood for metabolism and development. Boophil is the first midut FXa inhibitor also inhibiting thromosis.
Researchers have developed the Spatially Explicit Model of Enteric Tissue (SEMT) to investigate the role of inflammation in shaping the architecture of the intestinal mucosa, a finely tuned system where structure influences and is influenced by function as an absorptive surface and defensive barrier. Mucosal histology plays a key role in diagnosis and pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases, and inflammation is a significant factor in pathogenesis of many diseases, governing maintenance of mucosal architecture morphogenesis. SEMT dynamically represents enter epithelial tissue behavior influenced by inflammation, generating a variety of pathophysiological processes on a common platform from a knowledge base. It reproduces healthy ileal mucosal dynamics and series of morph knock-inhibition experiments, providing insight into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as PTEN/PIK as key crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, enterocyte slough in ischemia-reper, and chronic inflammation driver colonic metaplas. SEMT integrates intra-cellular morph signaling, intra-cell inflammatory pathway, cell transitions proliferation, differentiation, movement, and morphogen diffusion to define epithelial behavior for homeostasis of enteric mucosa architecture. An agent-based model simulates cellular and molecular interactions maintaining enter mucosal architecture. SEMT models dynamics cryptillus tissue by epithelial behavior replication, migration, differentiation, incorporating inflammation effect on morph processes. SEMTPC represents large customizable epithelial surfaces, an instantiation minimally sufficient components achieving valid representation mechanisms maintaining enteric architecture morphogenesis and response perturbations.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacterium, in controlling Aedes aegypt mosquito populations, a primary vector of arbovirus transmission. Traditional control methods, such as insecticide spraying, have limited success. Wolia was deployed in Tubanga, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with 180,000 mosquitoes released over 20 weeks. However, it failed to spread in the population due to high pyrethroid resistance in wild mosquitoes. A new strain, wRio, was created by crossing wBr females with field males to introduce pyth resistance. wRio increased mosquito survival but negatively affected fecundity, reducing egg clutch size and hatch. Despite fitness costs, wRio established where w failed, highlighting the importance of matching local genetics, especially pyth resistance, for invasion. Household support remained high, 90%, despite summer temperatures above 30°C not affecting transmission. Wolia deployment must consider pyth resistance in wild populations, as it's widespread in Aegypt.
Researchers investigated the role of the vaccinia B protein in poxvirus replication and its interaction with the cellular antiviral factor BAF. They created a virus with a deletion of the B gene and observed an increase in viral titer after several passages. Characterization of the adapted virus revealed mutations correlating with loss of function of the vaccinia B pseudokinase, which provided a fitness enhancement to the virus. This suggests that loss of function can be beneficial for poxirus adaptation. The study found that expression of full-length B leads to a reduction in fitness in viruses with a defect in B, but no impact on wild-type or mutant viruses, indicating that B possesses inhibitory activity masked by the presence of B kinase. Investigation of B revealed it localizes to the nucleus, a rare characteristic among poxiral proteins, and reduces BAF phosphorylation when present in cells without B, suggesting it enhances antiral activity of B. The study presents evidence of a paralog kinase-pseudase pair exhibiting epistasis in virus, potentially enhancing B conservation during pox evolution and orchestrating nuclear events during infection.
Researchers investigated the conformation behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKKLLKKLL (L) and EAAEAAEAAE (E), with built-in amphiphilicity forming an alpha-helix, using molecular dynamics simulations. The peptides were neither random coils nor fully alpha-helices in bulk water, but adopted multiple conformations with short lifetimes, providing a basis for conformation and population shift upon environmental changes. Differences in response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces were linked to inherent alphael tendencies in bulk. The peptides' aggregation was affected by presence or absence of interface, and subtly by surface charge and hydrophobicity. In bulk, the peptides displayed a variety of secondary structures, including partial alpha-hices. When exposed to a macroscopic/water interface, hydrophobic/hydrophobic partitioning stabilized alphael conformation for both peptides. The L peptide's bulk ensemble was dominated by conformations with a large fraction in alphael state.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus that infects humans within the first years of life and establishes latency in various cell types. The virus integrates its genome into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells, but the molecular mechanism of integration remains elusive. Interestingly, HHV-6 and other herpesviruses harbor telomeric repeats (TMR) identical to human telomere sequences at the ends of their genomes. The HH-6 genome contains two T arrays, the perfect MR (pMR) and imperfect MR (impMR). To determine if T are involved in integration, both pMR and impMR were deleted in the HH-6 genome. Upon reconstitution, the T mutant replicated comparable to wild-type virus, indicating T are not essential for HH-6 replication. To assess integration, an in vitro system was established to evaluate efficiency and maintenance in latently infected cells. Integration of HH-6 was impaired without T, and the genome was rapidly lost, suggesting integration is crucial for maintenance. Individual deletion of pMR and impMR revealed pMR plays a major role in HH-6 integration, while impMR makes a minor contribution, establishing a model for HH-6 integration. T of HH-6 are dispensable for replication but crucial for integration and maintenance in latently infected cells. Data suggest T of HH-6 and other viruses facilitate integration into host telomeres, a mechanism for maintenance in latently infected cells. Integration occurs in vitro and in vivo. T have been identified in HH- genome years, but role remained elusive. Hypothesized T facilitate integration by homologous recombination. This study determined role of T in replication and integration. Recombinant viruses lacking all T or only pMR or impMR were generated.
Researchers have determined the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the vaccinia virus protein D13, a key component of the outer scaffold of viral crescent precursors. D13 folds into a double-barrel structure consisting of two jellyrolls (J1 and J2) decorated by a β-sand forming head domain. The structure assembles into trimers homologous to double-bar capsid proteins of adenovirus and icosahedral viruses. When tethered onto artificial membranes, D forms a honeycomb lattice assembly structurally similar to viral crescent and immature particles. The architecture of the D honeycomb and lipid-remodeling abilities of D support a model of assembly similar to mimivirus. These findings establish that the first step of poxirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-odeling strategy common to icosahedral viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. D is also a target of rifampic and its structure will aid in the development of poxirus inhibitors. The protein D has intrinsic ability to form immature particles in the absence of other viral factors, and its neutralization by mutation or rific completely inhibits assembly.
Researchers studied the role of auxin and ethylene in root development in Brachodium distyon, a monocotyledonous plant, and compared it to Arabidopsis, a dicotyledon. In Arabid, auxin biosynthesis via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) is essential for root development and requires TRYOPHANINAMOTANSFER OF ARABIDOPSIS 1 (T1) and T1-RELATED (TAR) genes. In contrast, Brachodium, a promoter-DNA insertion in the TAR-LIKE (T2) gene downregulates expression, reducing tryptophaninotransferase activity, creating a hypomorphic allele (dt2hypo). Unexpectedly, dt2 mutants display elongated roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype is also observed in a stronger allele and mimicked by treating wild-type with L-kyunine, a T1/T inhibitor. Surprisingly, Lkyine-treated and dt2 roots have elevated, not reduced auxin levels. This does not result from alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways, but increased expression of YCCA genes, rate-limiting IPA to auxin conversion. YCCA are downregulated by ethylene precursor 1-aminoclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and upregulated in eth-signaling component mutant ethylene 2-like 1, also displaying dt2 root phenotype. Brachodium phenotypes contrast with reduced growth and aux levels in Arabid t1/t mutants. This may be due to ethylene inhibiting the rate-limiting auxin biosynthesis in IPA-dependent manner, conferring suboptimal levels for cell elong, suggested by observations. Results reveal delicate homeostasis of aux and ethylene to control elong in Brach roots and alternative wiring of aux-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabid.
Research on the evolution of gene expression in species of the budding yeast has revealed a correlation between the organization of promoter nucleosomes and the rate of gene divergence. Genes lacking a nucleosome-free region, denoted as OP (Occupied Prox Nucleosomes), vary widely between species, while those containing a nucleosome region, denoted DPN (Depleted Prox Nucle), remain largely conserved. To investigate if early dynamics contribute to this difference, researchers artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins. Surprisingly, selection was successful for both OP and DPN genes, with approximately 80% of each group increasing expression by a similar amount. Notably, the groups adapted through distinct mechanisms: DPN-selected strains duplicated genomic regions, while OP-selected favored mutations involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN but not OP genes reverted to wild-type levels, consistent with lower diversity between species. Results suggest promoter organization constrains early dynamics and biases long-term evolution.
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) transactivator/oncoprotein Tax activates Iκ kinases (IKs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κ) to promote cell proliferation and transformation. However, Tax expression in most cells leads to upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21IP/WAF1 and p27IP, causing p53/pR-independent cellular senescence. This study demonstrates that p21IP/W1/p27-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IK/NFκ hyperactivation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations that reduce IK/NF activation and prevented by blocking NFκ using degradation-resistant mutant Iκα despite constitutive IK activation. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown indicates Rel induces senesc program acting upstream anaphase complex and Rel to stabilize p27IP protein and p21IP/W1 mRNA. Downregulation NFκ by HT-1 antisense protein HB delays or prevents Tax-induced senescence. The balance between Tax and HB expression determines HT-1 infection outcome. Robust HT1 replication and Tax expression drive IK/NF hyperactivation and senescence, while HB modulates Tax-mediated replication and NF activation, allowing HT-infected cells to proliferate and persist.
Researchers have proposed a new computational model of frontal lobe function to explain decision-making in uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations. The model, called PROBE, suggests that the frontal lobe monitors up to four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict outcomes, selecting the most reliable one to guide action and maximize rewards. When a strategy appears unreliable, a new one is formed from stored long-term memory, probed, and if confirmed, drives action. The executive function has a limited capacity for three to four strategies, compensated by a binary control structure promoting exploration and creation of new strategies in ambiguous situations. The model integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in decision-making and behavior. 

The PRO model clarifies how the executive controls creation, learning, storage, and selection of strategies for action. It regulates exploration and exploitation of rules and creativity for adaptive behavior. Results support a model of frontal function integrating reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in executive control and decision-making. The frontal lobe creates and manages an expanding repertoire of flexible strategies for action in uncertain, changing, and open environments. It manages task sets, representations stored in long-term memory for driving action. According to reinforcement learning, the actor adjusts behavior to maximize utility. The model addresses how the executive continuously arbitrates between adjusting the current set, switching to learned, and creating new sets for action.
Researchers have developed a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions on diseases. This approach uses time-dependent model parameters to analyze the dynamics of molecular adaptations, predicting necessary changes in parameters to describe transitions between experimental data at different stages of treatment. AD provides insight into affected biological systems and identifies molecular events to unravel mechanistic basis of treatment outcomes. Modulating interactions with proteome and transcriptome levels, often less understood, can be captured by time-dependent parameters. AD was applied to investigate metabolic adaptations upon pharmacological activation of liver receptor LXR, a potential target to treat atherosclerosis. Trajectories showed a counterintuitive function of scavenger receptor B1 (SR1), facilitating hepatic cholesterol uptake. Activation of LXR promotes cholesterol efflux-excretion, but analysis showed reduced hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol upon prolonged treatment, confirmed by immunoblot measurements of SR1 in hepatic membranes. AD can identify potential side effects and design interventions to prevent them.
Researchers propose a new hypothesis on how the spinocerebell system and cerebellum interact to coordinate multi-segment limbs and bodies. They suggest that sensory and motor signals are combined in spinocerebell neurons to approximate spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments, necessary for coordination. However, recombination of signals is limited by the number of granule cells, which can only represent a finite number of combinations. Instead, the spinal circuit provides useful recombinations described as linear projections in multi-dimensional sensorimotor space. Granule cells, aided by Golgi cells, enhance these projections allowing Purkinje cells to approximate non-linear functions. This hypothesis provides a new view on spinal and cerebell granule function, illustrating how cerebellum coordination is supported by spinocbell recombinations.

The spinocbell system avoids superfluous recombinations by combining signals in individual neurons, forming "good" recombinations with high probability. The spinal circuit makes sensorimotor functions available to cerebell via SCT systems. The structure of spinocbell network prior to granule must be considered to lift curse dimensionality. A simplified example of controlling a double joint arm illustrates coordination. The paper seeks a theoretical explanation for these observations in terms of spinal and cerebell circuit function, providing integration across dimensions for coordination.
Researchers used next-generation sequencing to investigate the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) during Chikunya virus (CHV) infection in the mosquito vector Aedes albopictus. They identified 88 known and 79 miRNAs in uninfected and CHV infected Ae. albictus cell lines, respectively, and nine novel miRNAs in Ae. albict. Comparison of the two libraries revealed differential expression of 77 miRN between CHV infection, specifically altering the mi profile of eight miRN. Putative targets of these miRN were classified into pathways. The study identified and described mi profiles of mi upon CHV in Ae. albict, providing insight into cellular modification by mi during CHV infection and potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies.

The researchers used Ae. albict cell line and profiled expression of mi upon CHV infection using next-generation sequencing, identifying 90 mi in Ae. alb, with eight mi common to both uninf and infected lines differentially regulated upon CHV. Computational analysis predicted targets of modulated mi and studied pathways in Ae. alb. The distribution and abundance of mi were evaluated upon CHV, and target and pathway analysis were performed, shedding light on the role of mi. Comparison of Ae. mi with A. stepensi mi upon Plasmod infection revealed information on mi of two vectors upon pathogen infection.

Four overexpressed mi (mi-100, mi-283, mi-305p, and mi-927) and underexpressed mi (mi-0, mi-2, mi-3p and-5) were analyzed for putative targets. High-throughput RNA sequencing Illumina platform was used on small libraries from CHV Ae. albict line compared to uninf line, with details in Table 1.
A study estimated the economic burden of Cysticercosis (CE) in Iran, a parasitic disease affecting humans and livestock, using epidemiological and economic data from 2000-2009. The estimated number of surgical cases per year was 1,295, and asymptomatic individuals 635,232 (95% CI 149,466-1,120,998). The overall cost of CE in Iran was $232.3 million (95% CI $103.1-397.8 million), including direct and indirect costs. Human-related costs were $93.39 million (95 CI $6.1-222.7 million) and livestock-related $132 million (95 CI $61.8-246.5 million). The cost per case was $1,539. CE had a significant economic impact on Iran, equating to 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. A surveillance system and control program implementation are necessary to reduce the burden. A cost-benefit analysis of control programs is recommended, incorporating losses due to CE in Iran. Productivity losses in asymptomatic, prevalence in sheep, and fecundity in cattle had the largest impact on overall cost.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPV) infection in mouse cells to understand the dynamics of viral and host gene expression, as well as promiscuous viral RNA editing. They used deep sequencing to follow MPV infection in NIH3T cells at various times and analyzed both viral and cellular transcriptomes. The study revealed a switch from early-to-late transcription, with both strands being transcribed at all times. Novel insights emerged, including widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts late in infection. By late infection, 359 host genes were upregulated and 857 downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed upregulated transcripts in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover, while downregulated in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc binding, SH domain, and GTP activation. Noncoding RNAs were also altered, with MAL1 downregulated and several upregulated. The study provides a global view of MPV infection and its effects on host growth and metabolism.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, with over two-fifths experiencing severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as 'hitting the wall', and thousands dropping out before the finish. Analyses of endurance physiology have suggested glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making 'hitting the wall inevitable, or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon withouthitting. This study demonstrates that energetic constraints on runners are more subtle, depending on physi variables including muscle distribution, liver glycogen, and running intensity as a fraction of aerobic capacity, in personalized but quantifiable and predictable ways. The approach estimates distance at which runners exhaust glyc stores as a function of intensity, providing guidelines for safety and performance optimization by setting paces and prescribing fuel requirements. The analysis sheds light on standards in running that have remained empirically defined, such as Boston Marathon qualifying times.

Carbohydrate loading influences performance by permitting runners to run at greater speeds withouthitting, succumbing to exhaustion. Typical levels permit completion between four and five hours, as indicated by intersections with the border of the 'Gc Loading Supercomp' region. The likelihood ofhitting exhibits a peak around mile 21, followed by a decline. The model incorporates running cost and dependence on exertion, revealing dependencies of distance to glyc depletion and fastest pace without glyc stores.
Researchers conducted a transcriptional analysis of murine macrophages infected with different Toxoplas strains to identify novel regulation of host signaling pathways. Toxoplas from Europe and North America belong to three distinct lineages, type I, II, and III, while South America has a variety of other strains. T. gondii strains differ in virulence, persistence, oral infectivity, migratory capacity, cytokine expression, and host gene modulation. The outcome of toxoplasis in patients varies, and the parasite genotype is hypothesized to play a role. Macrophages are essential in early immune response against T. gondii and preferentially infected in vivo. To determine non-canonical Tooplas interactions, murine macrophages were infected with 29 Tooplas strains, representing diversity, and RNA-sequencing determined host and parasite transcriptomes. Large differences were found between strains in expression of parasite effectors and chromosomal variation. Novel strain-specific regulated pathways were identified, including type I interferon response regulation by atypical strains. IFβ production was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic retic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG) in fibroblasts.

The study found that non-canonical Tooplas have unique interactions with host cells. Atypical strains have been associated with severe symptoms, but it was unknown if they differ in host interaction. The study provides murine macro and Tooplas transcriptomes after infection with 29 Tooplas. Clusters of regulated macro and parasite genes were enriched for annotation. Host pathways modulated by atypical Tooplas were identified by infecting macro with 29 strains, representing diversity, and global transcription profiles of host and parasite. Parasite transcriptomes showed differences in gene expression, including effectors and regulators like Apala-2 (AP) factors. The study provides insight into host and parasite responses with canonical and exoticoplas, and identifies strain-specific responses and effectors.
Researchers investigated the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows for the acquisition of new genetic material and is crucial for the emergence of novel pathogenic variants of poliovirus. Using a novel genetic approach, they isolated chimeric intertyp poliruses with extensive duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of these viruses with imprecise junctions yielded progeny with increased fitness, which lost the duplicated sequences. Mutations affecting polymerase fidelity or replication complexes altered recombination yield, but not non-recombination, indicating the process is replicative and can be enhanced or reduced. The study proposes a biphasic process: initial recombination followed by resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing fitness. This has implications for understanding evolution in positive-strand RNA viruses. An analysis of 136 polirus type 1/type 3 recombinants showed 70% contained additional sequences, 85% distinct junctions. In contrast, a study found sequence and structure correlated with recombination hotspots. The majority of recombinants contained sequences, both individual and group, within the recombination region. Recombinant poliruses previously do not contain sequences, suggesting imprec might be disadvantageous. Inhibitors of polirus replication, guanidine hydrochloride, yielded no recombinants. Cloned intra-seric recombinants were sequenced, but junctions could not be defined due to junction conservation. These results indicate recombination enterir is biphasic, generating imprec followed by precise recombinants with enhanced fitness.
Organic cation 3 (Oct) is a distinct catecholamine clearance route in adipocytes mediating beigeing of white adipose tissue. Beige of white adipose (W) is a target for therapeutics in treatment of metabolic diseases through norephrine (NE)-mediated pathways. Previous studies report NE mechanisms via SLC6A on sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in adipose (AT), but low cateol clearance of S6A may limit efficiency. This study shows mouse cation 3 (Oct;Slc22) is highly in W and displays uptake of NE as non-neural route clearance in adipocytes, differing from neurons or macrophages. Adipocytes express high degradation enzymes Mao, Maob, and Com, providing molecular basis for clearance by adipocytes with reuptake Oct. NE administration ablation of Oct induces higher thermogenesis and lipolysis compared controls. After cold challenge, inginal W (W) adip-specific Oct-deficient shows stronger browning and elevated thermogenic genes than controls, involving β-receptor (β)/protein kinase (PK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (c) activation. Glycol genes reprogrammed to compensate loss ATP in adip-specific Oct knockout. Inhibition β largely abolishes lipoly and therm activities in Oct-deficientW, indicating NE in vicinity adipocytes Oct. Reduced alleles OCT are associated with basal metabolic rate. Results demonstrate Oct govern β-activity as NE transporter in adipocytes, offering applications for disorders.
Researchers investigated the interaction between heterochromatin-enriched protein 1 (HP1) and histone H3, specifically the globular domain, to understand HP-mediated repression. They found that the chromoshadow domain of HP1 interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome, a region also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. In vitro, SW/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited by HP proteins. The antagonism between SW/SNF and HP proteins is observed on interferon-regulated genes, with SWNF favoring HP loading onto chromatin. HP proteins use this property to detect and arrest chromatin remodeling. The chromadow domain also binds histone H tails methylated lysine 9, an epigenetic mark associated with transcriptional repression. The region of HP proteins harbors DNA and RNA-binding activities, targeting to chrom likely results from integration of multiple contacts.
Researchers investigated the property of self-containment in RNA structures, which refers to the tendency of an RNA sequence to maintain its secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. They developed a scoring method called self-containment index to measure this property and found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance during biogenesis. In contrast, other structured RNAs do not show significant self-containment. Analysis revealed a trend towards higher self-containment among conserved miRNAs, suggesting it may be a characteristic of miRN acquiring new genomic contexts. miRNAs display enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, with a trend towards selection for self-cont in most RNA classes. The study suggests self-cont arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of function.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea and Plectphaella cucina. Mutants defective in any of these TFs displayed increased susceptibility to these pathogens, indicating their importance in disease resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes in the mutants, including several encoding secreted peptides named PROIR (provulence factors). Forward and reverse genetic analyses showed many PROIRs are essential for disease susceptibility to necrophic pathogens. The TFs and PROIRs identified represent novel determinants of plant susceptibility to necrophic fungal pathogens.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Forkhead Box 1 (FOX1) as a critical regulator of uterine receptivity for embryo implantation. In a study using the progesterone receptor (PGR) Cre mouse model, uterine ablation of Fox1 resulted in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing embryo penetration of the luminal epithelium. Analysis of the utine transcriptome after Fox1 ablation revealed alterations in gene expression for activation, invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-caten (CTN1) signaling, and increased P signaling. The increase in P signaling was due to PGR expression retained in the utine epithelium during the window of receptivity. Constitutive expression of epithelial P during this period inhibited FOX1 in the nucleus of utine epithelium. Reciprocal expression of P and FOX1 was conserved in human endrial samples during proliferative and secretory phase. This demonstrates expression FOX1 and loss of P during window recept are interrelated for implantation.

 FOX1 interacts with P in transcriptional regulation of molecules for endrial receptivity. Analysis revealed Fox1 ablation affects multiple pathways with implications on biological processes, P signaling and growth factor, required proper utine during implant. Transcript analysis Fox1/d uterus day 4.5 showed activation P pathway. Observations indicate spatiemporal and localization FOX1 P in epithelium mutual for successful implant during pregnancy. To investigate role FOX in utine recept, expression analyzed pattern with P in endrial tissue across menstrual cycle normalovulatory women. FOX1 may downregulate epith P, accounted infertility mice. FOX and P may regulatory relationship in epithel at W, substantiated sequestration FOX in response constitutive P nuclei during implant mice. FOX regulates multiple components pathways establish receptive including activation, molecular, apoptosis, CTN signaling, as well, inhibition P in murine epithelium.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the spread of deng cases in Bangladesh, accounting for underreporting and spatial and temporal effects. They used a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model to analyze district-level monthly deng cases from 2000 to 2009. The model found that mean temperature and its interaction with mean diurnal temperature range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with deng incidence. Mean rainfall two months prior was positively associated with deng. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated 92% of annual deng cases occurred between August and September. Cases were reported across the country, with 94 in the capital Dhaka, located in the middle. Less than half of affected districts reported cases as observed from surveillance. The proportion varied by month, with higher in high-incidence districts but dropped towards the end of transmission.
Researchers investigated the exploratory behavior of mice in a novel environment and identified a new type of preferred place called "knots" characterized by high tortuosity, which is a measure of the complexity of a path's curvature. These places, termed "knots", are marked by the performance of "knotcribling", a behavior that involves tracing a tortuous paths with twists and turns. Mice typically visit not more than one knot per session, which has distinct boundaries and is maintained within and across sessions. Knots are mostly situated near the point of introduction into the arena, away from walls, and are not characterized by features of a "home" except for high inbound speed and low outbound speed. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and arousal consolidate a long-term contingency between a locale and knotcribling. In an environment devoid of proximal cues, mice mark a locale with arousal by twisting and turning, creating a self-generated, centrally located landmark. The tortuosity of path during knotbling implies concurrent views of the environment, allowing re-calibration of the mouse's locale and compass directions. Rich vestibular input by knotbling could improve interpretation of the scene.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for antifungal therapy in the lipid transfer protein Sec14, which is essential for the pathogenicity of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. The compound NG04, an ergoline, was found to selectively inhibit the growth of C. neoans with high selectivity over mammalian cells. High-resolution chemogenomics revealed that Sec14 is the target of NG04, and mutations in Sec14 define the compound interactions in the binding pocket of the protein. Sec14 is involved in lipid transfer and virulence determinants in pathogenic fungi, making it an attractive antif target. NG04 inhibits growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoans and NG04-related compounds have equal or higher potency against C neoans. Furthermore, NG04 analogues showed fungicidal activity against fluconazole-resistant C. neoans strain. Sec14 proteins of S. cerevisiae and C neoans show 53% similarity with conservation of residues in the lipid-binding pocket. Three sites critical for NG04 sensitivity are conserved. Testing of NG04 and related ergoline analogs against C neo was prioritized due to high medical need. Aligning S cerevis SEC14 to C neo SEC-1 and SEC-2 shows residues involved in NG04 binding and resistance are conserved. In vitro activity of two clinical isolates of C neo was assessed, NG scored cryptococcal activity and potent derivatives identified. Secp virulence has been described for neo but not other pathogen.
Researchers have investigated the antischosomal properties of mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni and S japonicum. A single oral dose of mequine (200-400 mg/kg) resulted in high to total female worm reductions (72.3-100%) in both adult and young stages of the parasites. High worm reductions were also observed in developing stages of S. mansoni and S. japon in mice. Both mequine enantiomers showed comparable worm reductions when given to mice with subpatent or patent S. mans infection. These findings suggest the potential for a novel antischosomal drug based on aminoal functionality. Further in vitro and in vivo studies are underway to elucidate the mechanism and effect of mequine on S. haematium and other trematodes.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to map the distribution of podoiosis, a non-filar elephantiasis causing massive swelling of the lower legs, identified as a neglected disease by WHO in 2011. A multi-stage sampling design stratified the country by environmental risk of podoiosis, sampling 76 villages from 40 districts in 10 regions. Individuals 15 years or older were surveyed and screened for lymphedema. A clinical algorithm diagnosed podoiosis excluding filarial lymphema. Individuals with lymphema were tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and IgG using Alere Filasis Strips (F) test and Standard Diagnostics (SD) BIOL lymph filariasis Ig4 (W123) tests, and thick films. 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated, 83 with lymphema were identified, 2 were F positive and negative W123. No microfilar W bancft were found in blood of individuals with lymphema. 2 F positive cases were positive for Mansonella perst DNA and Loa loa microilar. 52 podoiosis were identified applying clinical algorithm. Prevalence of podoiosis 0.5% (95 CI 0.4-0.7). At least case podo in every region except Adamawa. 40 districts had no cases, 15 mean 0.2-1%, 8 mean 1.2-2.7%. The study demonstrated low but widespread podo in Cameroon. Designing podo control vital, health response to burden podo through surveillance and morbidity services.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the aging of Drosoph female germline stem cells (GSCs) and their adhesion to the niche. They found that Notch signaling increases with age in Gs, leading to their removal from the niche. Analysis revealed that Gs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesion to the niche, outcompeting neighbors with higher levels of Notch. Adhesion is altered through regulation of E-cadherin expression. Experimental enhancement of Notch in Gs hastens age-dependent loss from niche, and is partially mediated by lethal. Disruption of Not signaling in Gs does not delay G loss during aging, nor affects BMP signaling, which promotes self-renew of Gs. In contrast, Not activation in niche maintains niche integrity and mediates G retention, and is reduced with age, indicating Not regulates G occupancy both intrinsically and extrinsically.
Cyclin-Dependent Kinase-Like Function Shared by Beta and Gamma Subset of Conserved Herpesirus Protein Kinases

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL97 protein, a kinase, phosphorylates retinoblastoma (R) tumor suppressor and lamin A proteins, substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). A complementation assay showed UL97 has CDK-like activity. Seven human herpesviruses encode a kinase with sequence homology to UL97, termed conserved herpesirus kinases (CHPs). To determine if CDK activity of UL97 was shared by all CHPs, epitope-tagged alleles of each protein were expressed in Sa-2 cells to test R phosphorylation, U-2 cells monitor lamin disruption and A phosphorylation, or S cerevis cdc-13 cells assay CD function. CHPs from beta and gamma-herpesviruses, but not alpha-herpesviruses, phosphorylated R and lamin, disrupted nuclear lamina. All beta and gamma CHPs displayed CD activity in S cerevis, while alpha did not. Novel virally CD-like kinases were identified, abbreviated vCKs. Non-CD activities of UL, promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies (PMLBs) and cytoplasmic nuclear aggres, showed conservation among CHPs, not segregating specific families. Genomic conservation kinases not fully maintained at functional level. Data indicate kinases, targets approved antiviral drugs, serve overlapping non-overlapping functions during infections.

CHPs beta and gamma-herviruses phosphorylated R in vivo residues inactivate cell cycle inhibitory suppress function. Induced lamin phosphorylation and disrupted lamina. Beta and gamma CHPs, exception HH-8 KOR36, displayed CD function in yeast assay. CHP UL HH-5 HCM directly phosphorylated R tumor suppress protein residues targeted CD proteins control cell progression. Summary found conserved activity CHPs CD-like. Only beta and gammaherviruses, absent alpha-herviruses. Non-CD activities HH-CHP poorly conserved members.
A systematic review of environmental sampling methods for Burkholderia pseudalle, a Tier 1 select agent and cause of meloidosis, was conducted to update the global distribution map of the bacterium and propose international guidelines for soil sampling. A working party, the Detection Environmental Burkholder pseudalle Working Party (DEBP), was formed during the 6th Meloidosis Congress in 2010. PubMed was searched using MeSH terms pseudalle and meloidosis, and bibliographies were hand-searched for secondary references. The geographical distribution of pseudalle in the environment was mapped as definite, probable, or possible, and methodologies for detecting pseudalle were extracted. Global coverage was patchy, with a lack of studies in areas where meloid is suspected. Sampling and identification methods were variable and not robust. Consensus guidelines were developed to reduce false-negative results and provide affordable, low-tech methods for developed and developing countries. The guidelines provide a basis for an accurate global map of pseudalle.

pseudalle was detected in 82% of 61 studies using culture and/or PCR, but non-pathogenic Burkia spp were not excluded. Negative surveys were reported in Kenya and Australia, and a 1977 study in the USA identified a pseud-like organism as okomens. Meloid, a community-acquired disease caused by Gram-negative pseudalle, was first described in Burma in 1912, with most cases in Thailand and Darwin, Australia. 82% of studies detected pseud using culture/or PCR, with strains confirmed by genotyping in France, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, and Niger.
Researchers have identified peptides derived from the membrane-proximal region of the Dengue virus E protein that bind to a conformational intermediate of the E protein, which is a model for a fusion intermediate in the viral entry process. These peptides inhibit viral infectivity in a manner proportional to their affinity for the conformation intermediate, even when the peptide is removed from the preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. This suggests that the peptides bind to virions before attachment and are carried into endosomes, where acidification initiates fusion. The binding depends on particle dynamics, as there is no inhibition of infectivity when preincubation and separation at 4°C rather than 37°C. A two-step model for the mechanism of fusion is proposed, targeting the viral entry pathway as a way to block infection. The study supports and extends proposed mechanisms for how the conformation change promotes fusion, suggesting strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry. The peptides bind to the postfusion conformation of E, which is a model for a fusion intermediate, and inhibit viral infectivity. This is surprising as the transition to postfusion occurs in the sequestered environment of endosome. Membrane fusion is a critical for infectious entry of enveloped viruses, facilitated by a viral protein in response to cellular cues. Deng and flaviviruses penetrate endosomes following clathrin-mediated endocyt and proton is the immediate trigger.
Researchers have developed a method to sequence the Vibrio cholera genome directly from dried filter paper specimens, which can be used in resource-limited settings to analyze cholera outbreaks. Cholera causes approximately 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually, with recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen highlighting its global health concern. Specimens preserved on filter paper allow molecular analysis of Vibrio cholera in low-cost, safe, and sustainable manner, providing previously unavailable data on circulating strains. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) recovered a complete sequence of V. cholera O genome from stool enriched alkaline pept water (AP) and culture isolates spotted on filter. Minimum V cholera DNA concentration to produce genomic information was 0.02 ng/μL. GS confirmed presence or absence of epidemiological genes, including chol toxin and pilus loci. GS identified diarral pathogens from AP-enrich specimen filter, highlighting potential to explore gut microbiome and co-infections impacting disease severity. GS mapped reads from AP-enrich specimen and isolate filter papers provided molecular epidemiological information on V cholera strains in remote settings, identifying co-infecting pathogens and specific strains causing outbreaks.
Researchers have identified a protein called Dyne that plays a crucial role in regulating the polarity of epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. Epithelial cells have distinct apical and basolateral regions, and precise targeting of proteins to these regions is essential for their architecture. A genetic screen in Drosophila follicle cells revealed that Dyne is essential for apical-basal polarity. Dy acts through a protein called Stardust (Sdt) to localize a transmembrane protein called Crumbs to the apical surface. This is achieved by targeting specific dt mRNA isoforms to the apical region. The researchers found that the dt mRNA localization signal is controlled by an alternatively spliced exon, a coding region of the dt gene. Interestingly, the presence or absence of this exon corresponds to a developmental switch in dt localization, with apical transcripts found in early stages of epithelial development and unlocalized in mature epithelia. This is the first demonstration of Dyne's role in epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization may regulate ap-basal organization. Additionally, the study introduces a mechanism where alternative splicing of a coding exon controls mRNA localization during development.
Researchers have investigated the mode of reproduction in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, and found evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in the natural vector. They developed transgenic L. infant lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters and hypothesized that cells with identical genotypes could recognize and mate. The markers were successfully exchanged within the sand midgut of the vector Phlebotus periciosus when individuals were fed a mixture of parental clones. Using the yellow and drug markers, they provided evidence of genetic exchange in L. infant. Hybrid progeny appeared to be triploid based on DNA content and was stable throughout the parasite cycle. Infections by the hybrid in BAL/c mice showed reduced parasite loads in spleen and liver and weight similar to uninfected mice. Sple argin activity was also reduced relative to parental strains. A L infant hybrid was obtained from intracl genetic exchange in the midgut of the vector, suggesting ability to recognize same genotype and mate. Hybrid progeny was stable throughout life with slower virulence correlating with lower argin activity in vitro and in vivo.
A study was conducted to characterize Leishmania donani strains isolated from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV co-infections in north and south Ethiopia. Sixty-three strains were examined using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), cystine protease B (cp), and HASPB. The ITS and cp PCR identified the strains as Leishmania donani. However, the HAS PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Most strains from north Ethiopia (36/40) produced a 290bp product, while a minority (4/40) gave a 410 amplicon, all from patients with HIV-VL co-infections. Most strains (20/23) from south Ethiopia produced a 450 amplicon, with smaller products (290 or 360) observed in three. Sudanese strains produced amplicons identical to those in north Ethiopia, while Kenyan strains gave larger PCR products (500 and 650). High-resolution melt (HR) analysis distinguished different products. Sequence analysis showed the HAS repeat region in Leish donani comprised polymorphic 13 and 14 amino motifs. The 13 amino peptide, prevalent in Leish donani, is rare in Leishum. The number and order of repeats in Leishani varies between geographic. The HAS region shows considerable polymorphism among Leish strains from regions in East Africa. This should be considered when designing assays and vaccines based on antigen.
Researchers investigated the distribution of recombination breakpoints in HIV-1 genomes, which contribute to the diversity of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. They developed a probabilistic model of HIV-1 recombination based on local sequence identity and compared it to the distribution of breakpoints in the HIV pandemic. The model accurately predicted the frequencies of inter-subtype recombination across much of the HIV genome, indicating that local sequence-dependent recombination is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. However, regions with significant overrepresentation of breakpoints, such as the env gene, and underrepresentation, like gag and pol, suggest natural selection influences the recombination pattern. The paucity of breakpoints in the envelope gene indicates recombinants in this region are less likely to be successful. Breakpoints at higher than predicted are near env, indicating selection for recombinants due to this region's tendency to be recombined as a unit. Findings indicate a portion of the genome deviates from the probabilistic model, suggesting only a minority of recombination events contribute to HIV-1 evolution.
Researchers in neuroscience have traditionally used separate statistical methods to address two interconnected problems: estimating individual parameters of a computational model across a population of subjects and comparing candidate models based on their fits to each subject's data. However, the population parameters of a model depend on which subjects express the model, creating an interdependence between the two problems. A new hierarchical Bayesian inference (H) framework is proposed for concurrent model comparison and parameter estimation at the population level, combining previous approaches. This framework has advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally, with estimated parameters showing smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by H is robust against outliers and not biased towards simplistic models. A fully Bayesian approach enables researchers to make inference on group parameters by H-test. 

The H framework is hierarchical in that individual parameters are regularized by statistics across individuals in the group and Bayesian in that uncertainties at both individual and group are represented by probability distributions. Evaluating a model for a subject's data precedes estimation of its parameter values, previous research used separate tools to solve these problems but statistically they are interconnected because parameters and individual depend on subjects that belong to the population expressing the model. This addresses the challenge from a Bayesian viewpoint. The work introduces a novel method, a hierarchical and Bayesian framework for estimation and comparison. The H framework is hierarchical that parameters at individual are regularized by statistics all in the group and Bayesian that uncertainties both individual and group are represented by distributions.
Researchers investigated the role of rhombomeres and Hox genes in the development of the auditory circuitry in the mouse brainstem. Rhomberes, specifically r4, contribute to the formation of functionally linked sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN), and olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of r-derived auditory components is involved in sound perception and depends on interactions between Hox1 and H2. In H1 and H2 mutant mice, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is lost, resulting in hearing impairments. On the other hand, H2 regulates Rig1 axon guidance and contralateral projections from VC to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid, a circuit in sound localization. Individual rhomeres and associated H codes control distinct functionally segregated circuits in the developing brainstem. VCN neurons are involved in the reflex loop through facial motor nucleus originated in ventral4 and affected in H1 mutant. A single rhomere, r4, contributes various derivatives of the pathway distributed across rhomeres via migrations and structurally linked into functional circuits for proper hearing. H1 and H2 are crucial in r patterning r identity and ventral4 into anterior in absence, based on ectopic markers and abnormal FBM neurons. This study shows similar regulation in dorsal4 specification of sensory derivatives. H genes are candidates in assembly of sensorimotor circuits in the hindbrain. Rhom-specific and H-dependent main auditory subcircuits are established and maintained. H1 deletion results in re-patter of ventral4 into anterior.
Researchers have completed the genome sequence of Saccharophagus deans strain 2-40 (S2-40), a marine bacterium capable of degrading complex carbohydrates. The genome analysis reveals a large number of enzymes that break down polysaccharides, with many exhibiting novel combinations of catalytic and substrate modules. These features are hypothesized to facilitate depolymerization of complex polysacides in the marine environment. This is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium that degrades plant cell walls, a component of the carbon cycle not well-characterized in the marine.

Studies show that 2-40 carbohydrases are regulated by multiple mechanisms, with more complex polyscharides inducing more enzymes, and glucose as a key regulation mechanism. The carbohydrases are functional in microcos as 2-40 grows on plants as sole carbon sources, fully degrading them, the first marine prokary to do so. 2-40 is a free-living marine bacterium capable of degrading cellulos algae and plant material, related to cellulolytic nitrogen-fixing bacteria. A metagenomic expedition revealed related genes among the most abundant in oceans, suggesting a key role in recycling marine biomass, enhancing turnover of recalcant polyschar and atmospheric CO inputs.

The S-40 enzymatic capabilities suggest a role in the carbon cycle as a "supergrader" mediating breakdown of polysides from plants and invertebrates, an understudied system. The S-40 genome is sequenced and closed. Polyschar degrading systems contain multiple enzymes with synergistic activities, such as cellulase with endo and exo-acting enzymes.
Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes significant childhood neurological infections in Asia. Over the past 20 years, JEV genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI). The mechanism of this shift is unknown. Culex (Cx) mosquitoes, particularly Cx pipiens, play a crucial role in JE transmission. This study used Cx pip mosquitoes from China as an in vivo model to explore their potential role in JEV shift. Female Cx pip mosquitoes were exposed to GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, organs, and saliv glands of infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) to measure infection rate, replication, dissemination, and transmission of JEV in Cx pip. Cx pip was competent for both GI and GIII infection with similar rates and kinetics. Both genotypes disseminated to secondary organs at similar rates. GI-infected saliv glands (16.2%) were positive at 7dpi, while GIII was undetectable. However, 29.4% (5/17) and 36.3 (8) were positive at 14dpi. No difference in transmission rate between GI and G-infected was detected. GI and GIII have similar infectivity in Cx pip, suggesting C pip may not play a critical role in J shift.
A two-year review of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of deng deaths in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014 was conducted. The study aimed to investigate demographics and clinical factors associated with deng deaths in the country. A total of 322 deng deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40.7 years and 72.5% being adults. Diabetes and hypertension were common co-morbidities among adults and elderly. The most common symptoms reported were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children and abdominal pain in adults. 22.4% had no symptoms and 34% were suspected deng at initial presentation. Adults developed severe plasma leakage more often and half suffered multi-organ involvement. Deng deaths occurred at 3 days post-admission. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) contributed 70% of deaths, followed by organ involvement 69% and bleeding 29.7%. In Malaysia, deng deaths primarily occurred in adults, with SS the leading cause regardless of age. The study highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent deng deaths.
Researchers investigated the relationship between insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, and female attractiveness in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They found that global manipulation of insulin signaling affects sexual attractiveness, with effects deriving from insulin signaling in the body and ovarian follicle cells, which are integrated by pherone-producing cells called oocytes. Functional ovaries are required for global insulin effects on attractiveness, and manipulations of insulin specifically in follicle cells recapitulated global effects. Modulation of insulin in the body produced opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with ovary. Tissue-specific insulin manipulations changed attractiveness and fecundity in the same direction, indicating insulin activity as a link between fecundity and attractiveness cues. Cues, cuticular hydrocarbons responded to body and follicle manipulations, indicating independent readouts of pathway activity from these tissues. A system is described where attractiveness results from connection between cues and organism state of fecund, both created by insulin in body and increased in follicle cells.
Researchers investigated the heterogeneity of Ebola virus disease (EVD) transmission during the 2013-2015 epidemic in West Africa, focusing on Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. They used a statistical approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each district and country, using weekly incident case numbers. The study found that district-level R ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. At the national level, estimated R was 0.97 (95% CI 0.77-1.18) for Guinea, 1.26 (95% 0.98-1.55) for Liberia, and 1.66 (95 1.32-2) for Sierra. Socio-demographic variables, such as high population density and wealth index, were positively associated with R, suggesting urban growth in West may have contributed to EVD spread. The study used district-level data and implemented a modeling approach to calculate epidemic growth at country and district levels, estimating transmissibility of EVD as R for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra, and 53 districts. It explored the relationship between R and socio-demographic variables as drivers of E transmission at population level.
Researchers investigated the relationship between protein structure and age in determining evolutionary rates of protein evolution. Using a dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped PDB structures, they found that previously observed correlations between structural properties and evolutionary rates held within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and rates. However, age also played a role in modulating the relationship between solvent and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tended to evolve faster than older proteins. The study showed that reported relationships between age and rate could not be explained by structural biases among groups. Additionally, a knowledge-based function was introduced to study stability of proteins through large computation, finding that older proteins were more stable in native structure and robust to mutations than younger ones.
Polycomb-like 3 (P3) is a component of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that promotes embryonic stem cell (ES) self-renewal. Mass spectrometry identified P3 as a Suz12 binding partner and co-immunprecipitation confirmed P3 interactions with PR2 core components. Knockdown of P3 in ESCs increases spontaneous differentiation, yet does not affect early decisions assessed in teratom and embryoid bodies, indicating P3 has a specific role in self-renew. Consistent with P3 promoting PR2 function, decreasing P3 reduces H3me3 levels while overexpressing P3 increases H3me levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (IP-q) reveal P3 co-localizes with PR2 component Suz, and depletion of P3 decreases Suz binding at 60% PR2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues within P3 Tudor domain, implicated in recognizing methylated histones, compromises H3me formation, suggesting the Tud domain of P3 is essential. P3 and its paralog P2 exist in different PR complexes but bind many same PR targets, particularly Cp islands regulated by P3. P is critical for ESC-renew, histone methylation, and PR2 recruitment to subset genomic sites.
Researchers investigated the regulation of a chemoreceptor gene, sr-234, in Caenorhabditis elegans, which is involved in chemosensory behavior. The gene expression of sr-234 in the AD sensory neuron is regulated by the transcription factor MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) transcription factors. A cis-regulatory M2 site is necessary for starvation-induced downregulation of sr-234, while an E-box binds HL factors to drive expression in AD neurons. HL-2, HL-3, and HL-4 act in AD neurons to regulate sr-234. MX-3 and HL-30 in the intestine regulate sr- levels in AD neurons, dependent on insulin signaling in AD. Intestine-to-neuron regulation of sr-234 involves insulin-like peptides. The study shows cell-autonomous and non-autonomous transcription mechanisms by MEF and HL factors, allowing fine-tuning chemens responses to feeding state.
A study was conducted to investigate the association between the detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer (BU) disease in southeastern Australia. Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, from December 2004 to December 2009, and screened for M. ulcer using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of BU in residents during the same period was tallied to determine the average incidence in each location. A strong correlation was found between the detection of M. ulcer in mosquitoes and the risk of disease (r = 0.99; 95% CI 0.92-0.99; p<0.001). The results support the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the transmission of M. ulcer in southeastern Australia. This has implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU. The study suggests that public measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged in endemic areas. The study also raises the question of whether mosquitoes are involved in transmission of M ulcer in other endemic areas, such as Queensland and Africa, where majority of cases occur.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in the MRS2 gene, which encodes a magnesium ion channel in the mitochondrial membrane, as the cause of demyelination in rats. The mutation creates a novel splice site, leading to inactivation of the mutant allele, confirmed by transgenic rescue with wild-type MRS2 DNA. M2 encodes an essential component of the Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. Demy rats have mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, 60% reduction in ATP, and swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocy cytoplasm. M2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats show M2 expression in neurons, not oligodrocytes, and ultrastructurally in inner mitochondria membrane. Observations suggest dmy rats suffer mitochondrial disease and myelin maintenance mechanism different from production. Mg2 homeostasis in mitochondria essential for myelin maintenance. 

The dmy rats have astrogliosis and ED-1 macrophages in my-destroyed areas, indicating activated microglia and astrogl involvement in demel. Characterization by cloning identified MRSd as loss-of-function of M2 gene, previously unreported in mammalian species. M2 encodes inner Mg+ channel in mitochondria, family with orthologs in species. The demel syndrome appears unique, no homologue in mammalian, including humans. The causative gene M2 encodes protein essential electrophic Mg+ influx in mitochond. Pathological features and localization suggest demel results from mitochondrial disease.
Researchers analyzed eight clinical microarray studies to evaluate the consistency of gene expression signatures between internal and external studies. Current documentation of signatures does not allow for unambiguous application to external patients, hindering independent evaluation and clinical use. The study found that discrepancies between internal and external diagnoses can be as high as 30% (worst-case) and 18% (median). A proposed documentation strategy, which includes quantitative information, reduced the discrepancy to 1%. The process of bringing microarray gene expression signatures to clinical practice can be improved by better documentation. 

The study used eight clinicalarray studies involving different diseases and diagnostic/prognostic problems. Rawarray data is subject to noise, and preprocessing is common prior to analysis. The consistency of diagnoses depends on the documentation of the signature. Optimal consistency was obtained using the proposed strategy. No strong evidence was found favoring one approach over the other. Microarray signatures hold promise to improve diagnosis and prognosis, but evaluation is difficult and subject to research. A signature needs to hold independent information to existing prognostic markers. To impact clinical practice, signatures need to be communicated to other centers for evaluation and practitioners, requiring unambiguous documentation.
Researchers have investigated the structure of curli amyloid fibrils, which are secreted by Enterobacteriaceae bacteria and contribute to biofilm formation, promoting bacterial resistance to environmental stress. Crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major cur subunit Csg revealed a steric zipper of tightly mated β-sheets, demonstrating a link between curli and human amyloids. Anti-amyloid peptides, originally designed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β, inhibited Csg fibrillation and biofilm formation in Salmonella typhim. Moreover, Csg fibr cross-seeded amyloidβ, supporting structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. The study provides insights into amyogenic regions for cur formation, a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid biofilms, and hypothesizes self-propagating prion-like species from microbial source influencing neurodegenerative diseases. Two anti-amy peptides inhibited Csg fibrillation as well as full-length C and reduced biofilm in cur-expressing Salmonella. Fibr seeds of Csg and amyogenic facilitated Aβ. Cur proteins are produced via regulated processes and mediate cell adhesion, invasion, immune activation, and biofilms. Amyloids are ubiquitous in life, demonstrating role in physiological processes.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a significant cause of encephal in Asia, with high fatality rates and neurologic sequelae among survivors. The epidemiology of JE in the Philippines is not well-defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011-2014 was conducted to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule in the Philippines. Four databases and one library were searched for Japanese encephal and the Philippines. Data from acute encephal syndrome (AES) and JE surveillance from the national laboratory from 2011-2014 were tabulated and mapped. 29 reports on JE in the Philippines were identified, including 5 serologic, 18 clinical, and 8 animal studies. 18 studies reported 257 laboratory-confirmed JE cases from 1972-2013. JE virus (JEV) was the causative in 7-18% of cases of meningitis and encephal combined and 16-40 of clinical enal cases. Predominantly affected children under 15 years and 6-7 of cases resulted in death. Surveillance from 2011-2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed JE of 497 tested. This review demonstrates endemicity and geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting vaccine use in the country. Continued surveillance and laboratory confirmation are needed to quantify JE burden, guide prioritization of high-risk areas and vaccine schedule, and measure preventive measures.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate the origins of genetic robustness in bacterial metabolic networks across hundreds of species under various growth conditions. They found that variations in robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations. Robustness was decoupled into two components: environmental-dependent, responsible for 20% of non-essential reactions, associated with species' lifestyle (specialist/generalist), and environmental-independent, associated with intrinsic metabolic capacities (0.6 correlation). Higher robustness was observed in fast growers or organisms with extensive secondary metabolite production. Reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in pathogens were identified, potentially as novel drug targets. The study supports the notion that increased metabolic capacities drove the evolution of robustness in bacterial networks. Robustness can be studied at various biological levels, from molecular to organismal, where it's considered robust if a mutation insignificantly affects a trait. Environmental robust differs across species, with some tolerating wide habitats and others specialized nutritional requirements. The contribution of environmental robust to robust is demonstrated by evolving a new pathway using an external metabolite as an alternative to existing, promoting robustness. Environmental robust correlates with modularity (−0.43, P<e-16). The effect of environmental on genetic robust was studied in yeast, where half of non-essential genes were active under restricting conditions. However, environmental cannot fully explain dispensability, two hypotheses proposed: adaptive origin and intrinsic.
A randomized trial investigated the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunization in pre-school children and the impact of prazantel treatment on this outcome. The Immune Modulation and Childhood (IMCh) study was conducted in Enteb, Uganda, enrolling 193 Schosoni-infected and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. Infected children were randomized 1:1 to receive prazant 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles immunization. Plasma-meas IgG was measured at enrollment, 1 and 24 weeks post-immunization. Primary outcomes were IgG levels and percentage of participants with protective levels. Anti-meas Ig increased post-immun, but at 1 post-imm, Schoni-inf children had lower levels (adjusted mean 0.4 [0.2-0.7] and percentage with protective levels also lower (odds 0.1-0.9). Among Schoni-inf, Ig post-imm was higher in those treated with prant than those not (treated before-imm, 2.3[1.5-4.8]; at-imm 1.8[1.1-3.5). At 24 post-imm, Ig did not differ between groups, but tended lower in previously-inf children still Schoni-positive than those stool-negative. The study suggests Schoni infection impairs antibody response to measles immun and prant treatment improves it.
Researchers have developed a new statistical approach to study the evolution of bacterial populations using large-scale sequencing data. Traditional methods, such as phylogenetic analysis, are limited when dealing with extensive sampling and recombination. To address this, they introduced tools for detecting recombination between populations and a model describing population structure in sequence space. The approach was tested with Neisseria data, where genetic tools were combined with phylogenetic analysis. The software, BAPS 5.2, is available for download. BAPS captures various biological signals in molecular data, but interpretation requires complementary phylogen methods and knowledge. A sample of 508 Neisser strains was analyzed, assuming a simplified evolutionary model with a common local and global ancestor. Traditional genetic tools are not applicable to bacterial data due to lack of population conditions, while phylogen may be distorted by recombination. The new tools in BAPS enable large-scale population analysis, overcoming computational complexity of standard Bayesian methods. Neisser was chosen for validation due to frequent recombination and horizontal gene flow between species.
Researchers investigated the role of top-down beta rhythms in selective attention using a computational model of cortical areas. Beta rhythms in the 20 Hz frequency band have been linked to attention in previous studies, with top-down beta from higher areas to sensory areas supporting attention modulation. The model showed that top beta can activate ascending projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow inhibitory interneurons resonated to 20 Hz and modulated superficial activity in an attention-related manner, providing a potential mechanism for cholinergic support of selective attention. 

The study explored top beta projected to L5 interneurons, suggesting mechanisms for selective attention: L cells resonating to beta modulated superficial activity by ascending to upper layers. Two types of projections from L cells to upper layers were found, associated with beta activity in superficial in accord with attention response patterns reported by Fries et al. Top beta associated with attention enhanced gamma in L2/3, reduced beta in L2/3, and spiking of L3 cells. Excitatory interneuron connections gave biased competition structure, consistent with lateral connections in the model. The model aligns with top signals biasing competition, adding novel interamin interaction regulated by beta supporting selective attention.
Researchers have developed a new method, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS), to calibrate and predict stochastic compartmental models of epidemics. These models are useful for studying the emergence of new pathogens when the number of infectious individuals is small, but methods for parameter estimation and prediction are limited. SS applies a linear approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the epidemic state using new surveillance data. The method was evaluated using simulated outbreaks of a novel pathogen with weekly counts of new cases as a proxy for incidence. SS produced accurate estimates of key parameters, such as duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff, and the unobserved number of individuals during the epidemic. It also predicted future hospitalizations and attack rate accurately. SS outperformed three benchmark methods: likelihood with Poisson assumption, particle filtering, and Kalman filter in most scenarios. The method addresses challenges in parameter estimation and prediction during outbreaks when the state is partially observed and spread is stochastic. The posterior distribution from previous observations can be used as prior for new data. The method can be used for prediction, demonstrated by denoting the quantity to predict, such as future hospitalizations. Experiments compared SS with competing approaches in accuracy, estimating parameters, predicting behaviors, and inferring the state. The performance was tested to noise and model specification. Estimating parameters is challenging during emergence due to stochastic dynamics and complex processes, partially observable. Public health makers require tools to infer the state and parameters using imperfect data.
Researchers investigated how human perception is shaped by past sensory and decisional events. They used multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches to study the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports in adjustment and forced-choice tasks. Results showed that perceptual reports are biased by a hierarchy of serial processes: low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional attracts percept reports toward recent. This is consistent with a two-process model of dependence where decision persistence compensates for adaptation, leading to attractive biases in perception. A unified account proposes distinct mechanisms operating at different stages promote differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

The study found two contrasting forces shaping perception at any given moment, biasing appearance toward or away from past. Repulsive forces, low-level adaptation dominate stimuli requiring perceptual processing. The goal was to determine if serial dependence depends on past stimuli or previous response. Recent work showed past biases decisions about sensory input, but history of decisions may combine or outweigh stimuli. This result supports a hierarchical view of dependence and shows decisional affect percept even with new stimuli.

The study provides a unified account of concatenated perceptual and decision processes. A hierarchical model proposes two contrasting forces, adaptation and decision inertia, interact shaping experience and reactions to stimuli. In line with low continuity, dependence should originate from early neurons and be immune to later stages. However, results show two mechanisms: repulsive after sensory and attractive perceptual.
Researchers have investigated the role of transcription in circadian timekeeping in Drosila by analyzing the effects of a CY-viral protein 16 (VP) fusion in the Drosila system. The addition of the potent transcriptional activator VP to the CLKCY-VP complex enhanced transcriptional activity relative to the normal CLKCY heterodimer complex. This increase was observed in S2 cells and flies expressing CY-VP, which also had increased levels of CLKCY direct gene mRNAs and a short period, implicating circadian transcription in period determination. A detailed examination of reporter expression in CYVP-expressing flies suggested the short period was due to more rapid transcriptional phase. Importantly, behavioral effects required per promoter and were unlikely a consequence of generally higher levels, indicating CLKCY-VP effects were due to increased transcription. This suggests timing of transcription activation, not activation itself, was key to observed effects in CYVP-express flies. The results indicate circadian transcription contributes to circadian function in Dila.
Researchers investigated how a horizontally acquired gene, pmr, functions in different species, specifically in Salmonella and Escherichia coli. They found that pmr activates the Pmr/PB system in Salmonella but not in E coli, due to differences in the pmr protein. In Salmonella pmr binds to phosphorylated Pmr (mr-P), protecting it from dephosphorylation by mr, resulting in transcription of mr-dependent genes, including polymyxin resistance. However, E coli pmr cannot activate mr/PB in E coli because its pmr is highly divergent from Salmonella pmr. Replacement of E coli pmr with Salmonella homolog enabled E coli to activate mr/PB system. The researchers discovered that E coli pmB has higher phosphatase activity towards mr-P than Salmonella pm, and identified a pm domain responsible for this property. Replacing E coli pmB with Salmonella hom restored E coli resistance to polymin in mr-inducing conditions. These findings show that quantitative differences in biochemical activities of ancestral proteins dictate horizontally acquired gene's ability to confer species-specific traits, suggesting horizontally acquired genes can potentiate ancestral loci.
Researchers have developed a new method called Differentiation-Test to identify genes that are differentially expressed during the early stages of cell differentiation in a mixture of embryonic stem cells. This approach allows for the detection of genes that promote or inhibit differentiation without separating the cell types beforehand. By applying this method to murine embryonic stem cells, they identified Smad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renew, which was experimentally verified. The Different-Test makes several assumptions about the differentiation process, including that it starts from a homogeneous cell mixture and progresses to a heterogeneous mixture with varying gene expression levels. It does not assume the initial population is homogeneous. The method was used to study the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies. Early in this process, subsets of cells show expression changes biasing towards different lineages. Cellular differentiation is the process where a cell becomes more specialized by expressing a subset of genes. The search for genes is pursued in every process, but a principled approach is missing. The Different-Test was hypothesized to include uncharacterized regulators of plurotency and self-renew. Self-renew regulators have lower expression in differentiated cells and should be detectable in 4-day embryoid bodies. Short hairpin RNA was used to study two regulators detected by Different-, Smad1 and P2. Comparing Oct4 expressing and non-expressing cells, regulators were separated into two modules: upregulated during differentiation (differentiation) and downregulated (pluripotency).
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze gene variants associated with diseases, addressing a common bias in previous studies that can lead to false findings. This bias occurs when genes with longer coding sequences are more likely to be associated with each other, leading to exaggerated results. The new method, called phenotyp-link network, uses diverse data types of gene interactions and assesses associations with a novel method based on phenotypes. It controls for the previously unexplored bias in coding sequence length. The researchers tested the method on various data and networks, finding that genes associated with the same disease cluster more significantly in the phen-link network than in other networks. This method has the advantage of using over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations and semantic similarity, enhancing the network. It identifies functional associations among genes in the same disease after accounting for sequencing bias, demonstrating its power to cluster variants in polygenic disorders. The method was compared to another network, NETAG, developed by Gil and colleagues. The study highlights the limitation of case-control studies in associating rare variants with disease and the use of functional-enrich approaches to identify shared functions in mutated genes. Functional associations are often inferred from large-scale omics data due to the unknown function of many genes and scant pathways. The phen-link network was found to be superior in identifying associations among mutated genes in the same disease, accounting for sequencing bias.
Mexico implemented an 8% tax on non-essential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-per tax on sugar-sweet beverages (SBs) in January 2014 to prevent obesity and diabetes. This study evaluated changes in volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases in response to these taxes, stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). Data from 6,248 households in Nielsen's Mexico Consumer Panel (2012-2014) showed taxed food purchases declined by 5.1% in 2014 compared to expected pre-tax trends, with no change in untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods, medium SES 5.8% less, and high SES no change. The study's limitations include inability to infer causality due to national implementation and lack of control group, sample only urban areas, and 2 years prior data. Household purchases of non-essential foods declined in the first year after implementation. Future studies should evaluate taxes' impact on energy, dietary, and food patterns.
Researchers have proposed a biophysically plausible model of collision-sensitive neurons, such as the Lobula Giant Detector (LG) neuron in locust, which integrates information across a large part of the visual field. The model assumes that each channel is noisy and has a response threshold, and approximates a power law as a result of pooling these channels. This mechanism can predict many characteristics of the LG neuron, including its response to objects approaching on a collision course, and is robust against noise in the excitatory pathway but dependent on noise in the inhibitory pathway. The model, called n-ψ, is based on its predecessor η, which used an exact power law for scaling inhibitory input, but is more biophysically plausible. nψ is a class of collision-sensitive neurons with a maximum response before collision to objects with constant velocity. Noise plays a key role in approximating a power in the inhibitory pathway through threshold smoothing, predicted by integrating many inhibitory inputs. A power law alone does not suffice, as η would distort the LG's response to approaching objects. The biophysical principles underlying the LG's computations come from a simple model "noisy" or nψ, describing the membrane potential of the LG neuron, receiving Θ(t) and Θ(t) as input. Integration could be carried out by the dendritic tree of the LG. Conditions for each channel are presence of noise across channels and a threshold.
Cameroon has been endemic for Buruli ulcer (BU) since 1969, with institutional control efforts beginning in 2002. The National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBPUC) aimed to describe its evolution, achievements, and challenges from 2001-2014. Data from 2001-2014 was analyzed, and reports from the NUC reviewed. Case detection and control indicators were plotted to determine trends. A regression analysis of detection from 2005-2014 showed a significant drop in rate. In 14 years, 370 cases were notified, with a rate decrease from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000. Endemic districts rose from 2 to 64, with 5 diagnostic and 2 planned for 2015. The health system was strengthened, and research gained interest. Despite late start, progress was made in detection, management, system building, and research. However, reduced resources led to a drop in indicators since 2010.
Researchers investigated the effect of outcome valence (gains or losses) on confidence judgments in a reinforcement learning task, where participants learned stimulus-outcome associations through trial-and-error. In two experiments, participants were more confident in their choices when learning to gain compared to avoid losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias is driven by context-value, a dynamic estimate of the average-value of options necessary to explain performance in both gain and loss domains. The bias effect of context on confidence is domain-general and has significant consequences, particularly in volatile environments where individuals' learning strategies differ when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. A previous study showed that stakes can bias confidence in choices, with gains and losses bias upwards and downwards, respectively. Confidence impacts subsequent decision processes and strategies, and acts as a currency to trade-off between strategies. The study hypothesized that individuals would exhibit lower confidence in choices while avoiding losses compared to seeking, despite equal performance and difficulty. The bias was generated by learned-value, a latent variable in reinforcement models. Participants performed equally well in gain-seeking and loss-avoid learning contexts. Confidence is a meta-cognitive variable enabling comparisons of learning and decisions about adjusting strategies. Despite recent models of confidence in decision-making, how-makers estimate confidence in reinforcement contexts is poorly understood.
Researchers investigated the role of the non-structural protein 3 (ns3) in the replication of alphaviruses, a family of viruses that includes Semli Forest virus (SFV), Sindbis virus (SINV), and Chikungunya virus (CHV). Ns3 is a component of the viral replication complex and has a conserved amino-terminal domain involved in RNA synthesis and a poorly conserved carbox-terminal region. A carbox-terminal proline-rich motif in ns3 is shared among alphavir proteins and serves as a target for Src-homology 3 (SH) domains of amphiphin-1 and -2. The study found that ns3 of SF, SINV, and CHV showed avid SH-dependent binding to amphins. Upon alphavirus infection, intracellular distribution of amphin was altered and colocalized with ns3. Mutations in ns3 disrupting amphin SH binding and RNA-mediated silencing of amphin-2 resulted in impaired RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SF. Infection of Bal/c mice with SF carrying SH binding-defective ns3 was associated with decreased mortality. The study established SH domain-mediated binding of ns3 with amphin as an important host interaction promoting alphavirus replication.
A study was conducted to investigate the molecular epidemiology of chromoblastycosis in Brazil, a disease caused by members of the order Chaetothyales. 123 clinical strains of the disease were analyzed by sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed region and partial β-tubulin genes. The strains were divided into three clusters within the family Herpotiaceae, with Fonca being the most prevalent at 80%, followed by F monora 13%, nica 3%, and pnius 1%. Two novel species, Rhinadi and Cyphora, were also identified at 3% and 1%, respectively. The study found that Fonca pedso was the predominant in humid climates of South America, while mon was predominant in China. All four Fonca species related to chromobycosis were found in the Brazilian area, with pedso and nica strictly associated with the disease. The clinical isolates were from humid zones, and members of the group were not encountered. Fonca was nested in the 'ant-clade and contained the agents of the disease, with 80% being pedso, 13% mon, 3 nica, and 1 pni. Two novel species of fungi causing chromyc infections were described, with three genera recognized: Fonca, Rhadi, andphora.
Listeria monocytogenes infection induces DNA breaks in host cells, but surprisingly, the DNA damage response (DDR) is only moderately activated. The study reveals that the bacterium's toxin, listeriolysin O (LO), blocks the DDR by degrading the sensor protein Mre11. Knocking out or inhibiting proteins involved in DDR promotes bacterial replication, highlighting the mechanism's importance for infection control. Deletion or inhibition of DDR proteins leads to higher infection levels, demonstrating DDR can be a negative regulator of bacterial infection. Extracellular bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoe induce DNA damage, but this has not been studied in Lister infection. LO induces M11 degradation through proteasome-independent mechanism. DDR dampening is crucial for infection as inhibition of proteins in this pathway increases bacterial. The study uncovers DDR subversion during L monocogen infection and role in blocking bacterial proliferation.
Researchers have identified a protein called bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) as a key player in the replication of human herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), which cause common diseases in humans. By screening a library of epigenetic compounds, they found that inhibiting the BD domain of BR4 enhanced HSV infection. Using a specific inhibitor called JQ, they found that JQ acts through BR4, as knocking down BR4 expression blocked JQ's effect on HSV. BR4 regulates HSV replication by forming a complex with CDK and RNA polymerase II, while J1 promotes infection by directing the complex to viral gene promoters. Suppressing BR4 or CD9 activity hindered infection. The study suggests J1 enhances infection by switching BR4 to regulate viral gene expression from chromatin, as transient expression of BR4 BD1 or BD2 had similar effect to J1 treatment. Additionally, BR4 is a modulator for J1's action on HSV and has an essential role in infection.
Researchers conducted a study to understand the microbial ecology of noma cancrum, a disease causing severe facial disfigurement in 140,000 malnourished children yearly. The cause of noma remains elusive, with a mix of microbial infection, oral hygiene, and weakened immune system contributing to lesions. These lesions are entry points for unidentified microorganisms triggering gangren facial infections. The study sequenced 16S rRNA amplicons from sixty gingival fluid samples of twelve healthy children, twelve with noma lesions and healthy sites, and twelve with Acute Necrotizing Gingitis (ANG) and healthy sites. Compared to healthy individuals, diseased lesion samples were enriched with Spirocha and depleted Proteobacteria, while healthy sites from diseased had similar proportions of Spiro and Proteobacteria to controls. Samples from n mouths did not have higher Fusobacter abundance, casting doubt on its causative role. Microbial communities from n and AN lesions were dominated by Prevotella intermedia OT, less abundant in healthy sites. Multivariate analysis confirmed different bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites. Several OTUs in Erysotrichales, Cloidales, Boid, and Spirotales were identified as indicators of n, suggesting one or more microbes within these orders associated with n lesions.
Researchers investigated the role of quorum sensing in Bacillus thuringis, a bacterium that infects insects, to understand how it adapts to its environment and commits to sporulation. Quorum sensing is a system of cell-to-cell communication where bacteria release and respond to signaling peptides. Bacillus thuring uses regulators belonging to the RNPP family, including Npr, which acts as a transcription factor with its cognate peptide Npr, regulating genes for survival in the insect cadaver. In the absence of Npr, Npr inhibits sporulation by preventing SpoA-regulated genes through Kin-dependent phosphorylation of phosphotransferase SpoF, delaying the process. Npr's function is similar to Rap proteins without DNA-binding, controlling expression via protein-protein interactions. Residues interacting with SpoF suggest common inhibition of sporulation. The structure of Npr shows a flexible Rap-like structure, proposing a regulatory mechanism where Npr's residues are involved in two functions: Npr binding switches from dimer inhibitor to tetramer transcription activator in necrotrophic lifestyle. N thus coordinates sporulation and necrotism, ensuring survival and dissemination during infection.
Researchers have developed a new computational model to predict the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs for individual patients with HIV. The model, called proteochem, combines genotypic and phenotyp data with chemical properties of drugs to determine the best treatment regimen. A large dataset of 300,000 drug-mut bioactivity points was used to train the model, which achieved a prediction error below 0.5 Log Change. Compared to previous models based on sequence data alone, protechem performed better in resistance prediction, with a 0.76 Log versus 0.91. The model identified known and new resistance-conferring mutations in HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease. Applied to a public database, the model correctly predicted resistance 84% of cases, compared to 80% previously. Protechem models can predict phenotyp resistance from genotyp data, including novel mutants and mixtures, and inform users about prediction reliability.
A computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudop autocatalysis has been proposed and tested using Dictyostelium cells. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemaxis, simulates cell polarization and persistence, and predicts pseudop bias in chemotactic gradients. It also predicts lateral pseudop initiation in high chemotactic gradients. The model's predictive ability was tested by measuring the angle between successive pseudods at the front of the cell, which increased with the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient. The results agreed with the model well. The model and data suggest that rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils have an intrinsic pseudod cycle at the heart of their motility, implying that chemaxis relies on modification of pseudod behaviour rather than generation of new pseudods or actin polymerization by chemotants. The model is robust to changes in parameters and emerges two mechanisms of chemaxis, pseudod selection and orientation, from a simple model. The patterns of actin polymerization and depolymerization following stimuli are also observed without multiple pathways. This suggests that much of cell behaviour is an emergent from simple pathways, requiring a change in experimental approach to understanding chemaxis.
Fleas can transmit Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and bio-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and host blood sources. To investigate the effect of host blood on EPT, fleas were fed bacteremic mouse, rat, guinea pig, or gerbil blood, and the location and characteristics of infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pest were assessed 1-3 days post-infection. Surprisingly, 10-28% of rodent fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea blood regurgitated a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 hours. This phenomenon is termed post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). In contrast, PIER was rarely observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with accumulation of dense aggregates of Y. pest, red blood cell stroma, and oxyoglobin that filled the proventulus. At next feeding, fleas with PIER were 3-25 times more likely to appear blocked, with blood retained in the esagus, than fleas without P. Three days after feeding on bacteremic blood, Oropsa montana transmitted significantly more CFU than groups using mouse blood, and this transmission was bio-dependent. Data support a model where EPT results from regurgitation of pest from obstructed foregut and E and BD can temporally overlap.
Researchers have found that positive correlations among neurons in the brain can significantly enhance coding performance by suppressing errors and increasing the number of stimuli that can be encoded. Contrary to previous studies, which showed correlations to be detrimental or marginally beneficial, this study demonstrates a substantial improvement of several orders of magnitude. The probability of error can be reduced by many orders of magnitude and the number of stimuli encoded can be increased more than tenfold. This effect does not require unrealistic correlation values and can occur in populations with a few neurons. Heterogeneity in activity is shown to be beneficial and both error suppression and enhancement depend on a specific pattern of correlation. Tuning one or several parameters can lead to perfect coding. The pattern of positive correlation leads to a 'lock' of response that eliminates variability in subspace for stimulus discrimination.
Researchers have developed a conjugate vaccine against cholera, a severe diarrheal disease caused by Vibrio cholera, by combining the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholera O1 Inaba strain with a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (rTHC). The vaccine, called OSP:rTH, was tested in mice with varying doses (10-50 μg) and compositions of OSP to rTH molar ratio (3:1, 5:1, 10:1), adjuvants, and immunization routes. Results showed prominent anti-OSP and anti-T serum IgG responses, vibriodal and memory cell responses after intramuscular or intrader vaccination. Intestinal lamina prop IgA responses targeting OSP occurred after intrader vaccination. Comparable immune responses were found in mice immunized with variations, although memory and vibodal responses were blunted in mice receiving highest dose (50 μ). No change in immune responses was observed with or without adjuvant. Administration of rTH resulted in 55% protective efficacy in mouse cholera challenge model. The study reports development of an Inaba:rTH conjugate vaccine inducing memory and protection against cholera in mice.
A study was conducted to investigate the cross-reactivity of immunochromatographic test (ICT) cards in areas with contrasting endemicity of Loa loa and Mansonella perans in Cameroon, implications for shrinking the lymphatic filariasis map in the Central African region. A cross-sectional study assessed the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Mansonella perans in 42 villages across three regions of Cameroon. Blood samples were collected for detection of circulating filarial antigen by ICT and assessment of microfilaria using thick smear. Clinical manifestations of lymphatic filariasis were also assessed. Overall, 219 individuals participated, with 24 tested positive by ICT, prevalence ranging from 0% in South-west to 2.1% in North. Lymphedema diagnosed in 20 individuals, majority in North, none tested positive ICT. No microf Wuchereria bancft found in blood of individuals with positive ICT or lymphedema. Positive ICT associated with high Loa microfilar intensity, 21 with over 8,000 Loa microf/ml (odds ratio 15.4; 95%CI 6.1-39.0; p<0.001). Strong association observed between Loa prevalence and ICT area, rate 1% or more positive results in areas Loa prevalence 15%. No association ICT and Mansonella prevalence (Spearman rho -0.200; p0.747) and microf (odds 1.8;95CI0.8-4.2; p0.192). The study confirmed association ICT and Loa intensity and demonstrated ICT strongly associated high Lo prevalence. Results suggest main confounding factor positive test results high Loa levels. Findings indicate Wucher bancft less prevalent in Central region Lo highly assumed and accurate re-mapping region useful shrinking LF map distribution.
SARS-CoV replication is supported by a reticular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum. Positive-strand RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells. Their replication complexes are associated with modified cell membranes, ranging from spher membrane invaginations to elaborate webs of membranes and vesicles. The ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and role in replication remain poorly characterized. Double-membr vesicles (DMVs) were implicated in S-Co RNA synthesis. Electron tomography of infected cells revealed a three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. A unique reticular network of modified endoplasm reticulum integrates convol membranes, numerous DMs (200-300 nm), and ves packets arising from DM merger. Convoluted membranes were abundantly immunolabeled for viralase subunits. Double-stranded RNA, presumably the site of viral synthesis, localized to DM interior. No connection between DM and cytos was discerned, raising questions about DM formation and site S-Co RNA synthesis. The virus reorganization of host membranes into a network organizes replication and possibly hides from antiviral mechanisms. Biochemical studies of the complex and ultrastructural description will dissect early stages of coronavirus cycle and virus-host interactions.
Researchers have investigated the role of suberin, a chemical compound found in plant roots, in regulating water and mineral uptake in Arabidopsis thaliana, a model plant species. The study aimed to determine if suberin forms a barrier limiting extracellular or apoplastic transport of water and solutes in roots. A mutant, es1, characterized by increased suberin, showed reduced transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during vegetative growth. These changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreased accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn, and increased accumulation of Na, S, K, As, and Mo in the shoot. The study established a connection between suberin in roots and water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in the shoot, providing direct evidence that suberin plays a critical role in controlling water and mineral uptake to the leaves. The observed elemental accumulation in leaves suggest a significant component of radial transport of Ca, Mn, and Zn occurs in the apoplast.
Researchers investigated the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. They developed a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CT) model based on the biochemistry of rhodin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model reproduced both wild-type (WT) and mutant responses with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites using the same parameters. The sources of variability were dissected into components, revealing that randomness of sojourn times in phosphorylated states contributed to coefficient of variation (CV) of response, while randomness of number of R turn steps had negligible effect. This contradicts the view that larger number of decay steps R makes response more stable. Results indicate R shutoff responsible for variability, while diffusion of second messengers acts as suppressor. The biochemistry of rhodin deactivation was put into stochastic framework, reproducing SPR in WT and mutant mice, capable of analyzing randomness each phosphorylation state. This was interfaced with spatio-temp model, tracking diffusion of messengers and geometrical changes on photoresponse. The prevailing view is that activation causes variability, deactivation suppresses, and more decay steps make response stable.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to analyze stochastic reaction networks in fluctuating environments by decoupling the network from its environment. This is achieved by incorporating the environment's effect on the network into a new model, allowing for a self-contained stochastic model that summarizes system behaviors under all extrinsic fluctuations. The approach involves marginalizing system dynamics with respect to extrinsic fluctuations to obtain a decoupled model, which can be used for uncoupled analysis of a network subject to extrinsic noise. This method provides a novel tool to study how stochasticity is propagated along reaction networks, splitting environmental noise into two terms: suppressed and effective noise sensed by the network. The decoupled process can significantly reduce computational effort in Monte Carlo simulations, especially when the environment is costly to simulate, making it a general tool to split biochemical networks into easier-to-simulate parts. A stochastic reaction network is described by a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with species and reaction channels, with state denoted as and path on time intervals.
Researchers have developed a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) architecture that allows for real-time control and adaptation using spike events, enabling robust control across various tasks. The architecture consists of two main components: a unified control-theoretic optimal feedback (OFC) framework for intention estimation and training, and dynamic spike-based adaptation. The OFC model infers the user's motor intention during a closed-loop process, termed intention estimation, and is used for autonomous and assisted training. A point process model enables neural processing and decoder adaptation with every spike at a faster time scale than current decoders, allowing dynamic-event parameter adaptation unlike batch-based methods. Experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days dissociated the effects of these components. OF estimation improved performance compared to current techniques, assisted training allowed proficient control, and spike-based adaptation faster and consistent convergence than batch methods, robust to initialization. The architecture extended to tasks beyond training. This has implications for clinically viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers investigated the effect of stimulus structure on correlations in the retina by measuring responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells to natural and artificial stimuli with varying in correlation. They found that responses to spatio-temporally structured stimuli, such as movies, ganglion cells were modestly correlated, more than to white noise, but less than predicted by a non-adaptive model. To stimuli with purely spatial correlations, ganglion showed correlations consistent with static, non-ad receptive field nonlinearity. Ganglion cells responding to spatio-temporal stimuli had faster temporal kernels and stronger surrounds, which explained pairwise correlations across receptive field measurements. The retina reduced redundancies in spatio-temporal stimuli but not completely decorrelated, with output similar to white checkerboard correlations. Output varied between stimuli, but less than predicted by non-ad model. Experiments presented stimuli with varying spatial and temporal correlations, the retina never fully decorrelated, even with least correlated noise, some correlations present. Results recall previous studies on LGN and visual cortex receptive fields differing with natural versus random stimuli. Gain of ganglion responding to correlated stimuli changed with effective contrast, i.e. input nonlinearity standard deviation.
Researchers have developed an integrative multi-network and multi-classifier approach to predict genetic interactions, specifically synthetic lethality, which occurs when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. This approach improves upon existing methods by defining a large number of features characterizing relationships between pairs of genes from various data sources, including those independent of known interactions. A non-parametric multi-classifier system is used to predict interactions, enabling simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures. Experiments demonstrated improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art method. The approach was used to derive the first transcription factor genetic network, supported by literature, and predict interactions between non-essential gene pairs in yeast. This method is expected to be effective in uncovering new interactions in yeast and higher organisms like mouse and human, where few interactions have been identified.
The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GAH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA data to support collaborative research. The goal is to generate an informed understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the predisposition genes BR1 and BR2. Initially, reported variants in BR1 and BR2 from public databases were integrated into a single site, www.brca.org. The BR Exchange aims to provide a reliable and accessible record of interpreted variants for high-pen phenotype. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number in the largest public database at project outset, with approximately 7,250 classifications. The data is based on information from clinical databases, such as Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and Leiden Variation Database (LOV), as well as population databases linked to a single access. The BR Challenge brought together the international Evidence Network for Interpretation of Genomic Mutations (ENIG) consortium panel, expert clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and providers to advance understanding BR1 and BR2 variation.
Malaria, caused by the Plasmodium parasite, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in approximately one million deaths annually. To maintain redox balance and pathogenicity, Plmod relies on adequate redox processes. This study maps the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox proteins in Plasium falcum, providing the first complete red compartmentation picture. The apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid, harbors plant-like metabolic pathways, including fatty acid and heme biosynthesis. Two antioxidant enzymes, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, are absent in the parasite, offering potential for chemotherapeutic agents. Red-active enzymes are predicted to contain targeting sequences, but localization has not been demonstrated due to the parasite's life style and metabolic rate. Plmod has two NAD-dependent red systems with broad antioxidant mechanisms. This study maps the red system, understanding cellular functions and interactions, and demonstrates alternative translation initiation (ATI) in Plasium, used for differential protein localization.
Researchers investigated the role of electrostatic interactions in the folding and binding of PUM, an intrinsically disordered protein, to its partner Mcl-1 using a structure-based coarse-grained model with explicit Debye-Hück charge. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity, showing consistency with published data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength. Results showed that intramolecular electrostatic interactions had a minor influence on unbound PUM states, while intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic, played a significant role in the initial complex formation. The study revealed the binding mechanism in more detail than possible with experimental data alone, highlighting the importance of electrostatic interactions in IDP binding. Non-native electrostatic interactions were found to be crucial in the encounter complex formation.
Polycomb group (Pc) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain the silencing of key developmental genes outside their expression domains. Recent genome-wide analyses showed Poly (c) distribution binding to discrete Polycomb response elements (PREs). Within the nucleus, Poly proteins localize in structures called Polycomb bodies containing Poly-silenced genes, and it has been shown that PREs form and long-range networks. This study investigated the nuclear distribution of two Poly proteins, Polycomb (PC) and Polyhomeotic (PH), using a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP proteins, to analyze the formation and mobility of Poly bodies during fly embryogenesis and compare their behavior to the condensed euchromatin. Immuno-F experiments showed Poly bodies correspond to 3D counterparts of linear domains identified in genome studies. During embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate in Poly bodies, forming structures localized on euchatin domains with histone H3-methylated K27. Time-lapse analysis revealed two types of motion: Poly bodies and chromatin domains undergo long-range motions, corresponding to whole chromosome movement, and each body and domain has fast, highly constrained motion, moving within volumes larger than chromatin. Both types move within smaller chromosome territories, restricting interaction with other structures. Motion decreases in late developmental stages, suggesting chrom dynamics in gene silencing maintenance.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the livers of normally aging and prematurely aging mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mt mut mice). They found that mt mut mice have 10-times-higher mutation loads than wildtype siblings, with increased levels of truncated mt molecules and decreased sequence coverage in deleted regions. In contrast, mt mice have low frequencies of circular DNA deletions, which cannot drive premature aging. Sequence analysis shows that most mutations in heterozygous mt mice and wildtype siblings are inherited from heterozygous mothers, consistent with germl transmission. No increase in point or deletions was found in wildtype C57/6 mice with age, questioning causative role in aging. Additionally, no frequency of transversions increased with time in any genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as major cause mt mutations. Results indicate most somatic mt occur replication errors during development, not accumulation in adult life.
Researchers have discovered a new type of Na+-driven ATP synthase membrane motor in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, which uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of Na+. They found that this ionotive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via F1-ATP synthase with a novel Na recognition motif shared by human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, c-ring, indicate Na specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed Na stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to Na ionophoresin. Furthermore, Na has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion-binding sites in both the ATPase and c-ring. Definitive evidence of Na coupling is provided by identical structures of c-ring solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 and 2.6 resolution at pH 5.3 and 8.7, respectively. Na ions occupy binding sites, coordinated by four amino acids and a water. Intriguingly, two carboxylates mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate this implies a proton is bound concurrently to sites, although Na alone drives rotary mechanism. The structure reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATPases and provides basis for drug efforts against opportunistic pathogen.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the strength and duration of interactions between T cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on antigen-presenting cells and T cell activation in the body. Contrary to previous assumptions, they found that optimal T cell responses occur to peptides with intermediate strength and duration of interaction, rather than those with strong and long-lasting interactions. This was observed in a study where CD4 T cells were activated by immunization with a range of peptides with varying in vitro activation potency, resulting in functional effector and memory responses. The results suggest that T cell activation in the body is not fully recapitulated in laboratory experiments and highlight the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of T ligands in vaccine design.
Researchers studied the genome of the fungus Nect haematocca, a member of the Fusarium solani species complex, which includes over 50 species with diverse properties such as causing disease in plants and opportunistic infections in humans. They analyzed the most studied member, N haematocca mating population VI (MP), and found that genes controlling its ability to colonize specific habitats are on supernumerary chromosomes. Optical mapping revealed 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with a physical genome size of 54.43 Mb and 15,707 predicted genes, the largest in ascomycetes. Two gene classes contributed to expansion: genes not found in other fungi, including closest relative Fusarium gramineum, and multiple copies in N haematca MP. Supernary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 were confirmed absent in pulsed gel electrophoresis experiments, lacking chromosome-specific sequences on their ends. These chromosomes have unique sequences, duplicated genes, and lower G+C content compared to others. The origin of extra genes and supernary chromosomes is unknown, but expansion and size consistent with species' diverse habitats. Unique genes on supernary might account for isolates having different niches.
Researchers have developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to visualize the transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus (PR) particles in non-polar epithelial cells. The method uses total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy to image fluorescent particles near the plasma membrane and a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the moment of exytosis. Single-particle tracking and mean displacement analysis were used to characterize particle motion, and a panel of cellular proteins were imaged to identify those spatially and dynamically associated with exyt. Results show that virus particles travel to the plasma inside acidified secretory vesicles, with Rab GTPases Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11 present on the vesicles. These vesicles undergo fast directional transport to the site of exyt, frequently near patches of LLβ, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma. Vesicles are docked at the site of exyt for seconds before membrane fusion, displacing the virion across the plasma. After exyt, particles remain confined on the outer surface.
A study investigated the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on intestinal microbiota and host response in 109 primary school children in Taich, Taiwan. The results showed that Enterobias increased gut microbiota diversity, which peaked after mebendazole administration. At the phylum level, pinworm and meendazole were associated with decreased Fusobacteria and increased Actinobacteria. The relative abundance of probiotic Bifobacterium increased after enterobias and meend treatment. Intestinal SIg level was lower in pin-infected group, elevated in meend-treated. Higher pre-treatment Salmonella was associated with increased SIg after meend dewing. Exposure to pin and meend increased bacterial diversity, Actinob including probiotic Bifobacter, and decreased Fusob. SI level was lower in pin-inf, elevated in meend-treated. 

The study found Enterobias and meend dewing altered intestinalome, consistent with previous helmin-inf microbiota. Pin infection was associated with increased bacterial diversity. Further metabolomics studies are needed to evaluate pin and meend treatment on commens bacteria and host immune. Change in composition two weeks after meend on pin-inf could be confounded by late effects. More experiments, including animal studies, are needed to understand relationships pin and meend on gut composition and host responses.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thalian and found that the narrow-sense heritability of the trait in the population was statistically zero, indicating that most genetic variation was not additive. Standard genome-wide association (GWA) approaches failed to identify loci associated with root length due to the low additive variance captured by genome-wide genotypes. However, broad-sense heritability was significant, primarily due to epistasis, and epist GWA analysis revealed four pairs of interacting loci involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a multiple-testing corrected threshold. The genotype-phenotype maps of these pairs showed epasis cancelling out additive variance, explaining why loci were not detected in GWA. Accounting for epist interactions, seven loci involved in unique pairs explained a large fraction of phenotypic variance. One pair was significant despite small population size risk, while two of three pairs may be false-positives. The epist architecture explains low narrow-s heritability and insignificant GWA results. The study highlights the importance of accounting for both additive and non-additive variance in G analyses to detect contributing loci. A comprehensive set of G analyses identified additive and epist loci affecting the trait, consistent with low additive variance captured by genotyped markers. No additive loci reached Bonferr-corrected significance, but considerable epist variance was captured by genomic relationships between accessions.
Researchers analyzed 30,506 mitochondrial DNA (mt) sequences from diverse global populations to investigate the relationship between mtDNA background and disease-causing mutations. They assigned a pathogenic score to each sequence and found that the mean pathogenic score for disease-causing mutations differed significantly between mt macrohaplogroups. Disease-causing mutations were observed in all haplog backgrounds, but some were specific to certain clades, suggesting a founder effect, while others recurred within the same phylogenetic cluster. Sequence diversity showed disease-causing mutations were more frequent in young sequences and genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance. This suggests mtDNA background influences the likelihood of acquiring or retaining disease-causing mutations, explaining the low frequency of mt disease in specific ethnic groups. The study found 25% of disease-causing mutations were in major haplog, raising the possibility they are subhaplog markers, not pathogenic. Statistical analysis showed evidence of haplog clustering for 29.4% of recurrent disease-causing mt mutations after correcting for sample size. The dataset is representative of global populations and not enriched for rare variants or path mutations in patients with mitochondrial diseases.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study cell-cell interactions, specifically contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), on microped substrates. These substrates restrict cell migration to linear paths, leading to frequent collisions between polarized cells. The model includes cell shape mechanics and a minimal chemical model for CIL, reproducing all observed two-cell collision outcomes. A balance between internal polarization, C, and cell adhesion governs the collision outcome. Parameters controlling transitions between outcomes are cell adhesion strength, propulsion, and C rates. This suggests different cell types have distinct collision behavior and interventions modulate outcomes. To reproduce heterogeneity in cell collisions, parameters must be carefully tuned or assume variation in key parameters like adhesion.

The model provides detailed biochemical interactions, unlike generic mechanisms like flocking, alignment, or others. Results are qualitatively surprising compared to minimal models. A simplified C model would intuitively expect adhesion to reduce walking. This highlights the importance of complementing self-propelled particles with detailed shape models. Cell shape and adhesion influence collective migration, studied in epithelial jamming; results suggest combining may lead to new effects.

The model describes crawling and collision dynamics on microped stripes, applied from [28, including contact signaling in neural crest. It reproduces four phenotypes observed in crest or metastatic epithelial cells. Neither would arise in simplified models, arguing for full understanding interactions, biochemical C and contact are necessary. Results show coupling shape with biochemistry lead unintuitive, adhesion effects.
Researchers have investigated the dissociation mechanism of the thioredoxin (Tr) mixed disulfide complex, a process that has been debated for over twenty years. They used the complex between Tr and its endogenous substrate arsenate reductase (Ars) as a model. In this complex, a CysTr-CysArs disulfide is formed by the nucleophilic attack of CysTr on the Cys-CysArs in oxidized Ars. Theoretical analysis, molecular simulations, and biochemical experiments with C-mutants were used to study Tr mixedide dissociation. Conformation changes around the disulfide bring Cys in contact with Cys. Cys is activated for nucleic attack by hydrogen, and is found to be more reactive than CysArs. Additionally, directs its nucleic attack on more Cys than CysArs. This multidisciplinary approach provides insights into universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism in reduced and oxidized Tr.
Researchers investigated how people's preferences are influenced by social information in the context of temporal discounting, which is the tendency to value immediate rewards over future ones. Contrary to the idea that preferences are fixed, they found that people's tastes are plastic and can align with others even if conformity is not rewarded. They hypothesized that people are uncertain about their tastes and can learn by considering others' preferences through Bayesian updating. In a study of 14-24 year olds, they examined discounting behavior before and after observing others' choices, finding evidence for uncertainty and Bayesian updating. Participants' decision variability was better explained by a random taste model than a response noise model, and taste shifts were described by a Bayesian model accounting for uncertainty and social relevance. This has implications for neuroscience, clinical, and developmental research. 

In the study, subjects were modeled as uncertain about their tastes, reflected in choices before learning others' preferences. The taste-uncertainty (K) model assumed subjects updated a distribution over their taste and sampled to make a choice. The premise is that people are uncertain about their discounting, not beliefs about decisions given tastes. Uncertainty in preferences in absence of social influence is a basis for subsequent shift. The paradigm of discounting was used to model learning from others' preferences to form one's own. A study of 700 young people provided novel contributions: evidence that social information leads to Bayesian updates, better fit of the K model, dependence of preference-shift on variability, and decrease in uncertainty with age, suggesting variability reflects taste rather than noise. Uncertainty does not necessitate variability, people might estimate their modal taste and act on it.
Researchers investigated how multiple signaling pathways converge to regulate a coordinated response in yeast, specifically filamentous growth, a complex process that occurs under specific environmental conditions. They used a novel approach called secretion profiling to measure the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2, a mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth (FG) MAP pathway. Profiling of genomic collections showed that many pathways that regulate filament growth (AS, RIM, O1, PI, and RT) were also required for FG pathway activation, sensitizing it to multiple stimuli and synchronizing with the global network. Several regulators were required for MS2 expression, identifying MS2 as a "hub" where signals converge. Accessibility to MS2 was regulated by histone deacetylase (HD) Rpd3L, positively regulating FG activity and filament growth. The study provides a glimpse of regulatory hierarchy among pathways controlling filament growth, suggesting systems integration of circuitry coordinates other networks controlling complex behaviors.
Researchers investigated the role of gene expression changes in the evolution of divergent morphologies in filamentous fungi, specifically in the Sordomycetes, by culturing five species in a common environment and profiling genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. They reconstructed ancestral expression phenotypes and identified genes with the largest increases in expression across development. Knockout and phenotypic analysis in two divergent species showed altered fruiting development in species with increased expression. This approach proved more efficient than targeting whole genomes or gene families. Combining expression with phenotypes refined Bayesian networks of fruiting development regulation, a complex process in multicellular development. 

In Sordycetes, few developmental genes retain common phenotypes or phenotypes, yet numerous retain function in the process. Fruiting bodies are morphologically comparable, making them ideal for analysis of evolutionary questions: common and divergent sources of homolog phenotypes and novelty despite extant networks. Neurospora and Fus spp. revealed key genes in sexual development and regulation using systematic comparison and contrast of expression across taxa. Mapping variational properties with processes is critical to understanding evolution. Bayesian networks based on wild type measurements are hypothetical until verified by functional studies. Combining with phenotypes builds relationships among genes and their evolution. Estimation in ancestral lineages identifies putative changes in expression key to morphological innovation.
Researchers investigated the use of square electroporation to introduce transgenes and macromolecules into Schistosoma mansoni eggs, a developmental stage with a high ratio of germ to somatic cells, allowing for potential propagation and amplification by infecting snails with miracid hatched from treated eggs. Eggs were incubated with Cy-labeled siRNA and without electrop, showing Cy-signs detected by fluorescence in eggs and miracid hatched from treated. Electrop was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase, with lucifer activity detected 3 hours later, not evident in soaked eggs. Schist eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virions (ML) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein (SVG), proviruses detected by PCR in genomic from miracid h from vir-exposed eggs, indicating trans in larval schosomes. Quantitative PCR showed electrop resulted in 2-3 times copies of provirus in schosomes compared to soaking. Electrop was more effective for transduction of eggs with pseudyped ML than soaking alone.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called Perturbation Markovian Transmission (PM) model to study the dynamic behavior of large macromolecular assemblies. This model involves probing the assembly with an initial perturbation and assuming perturbations are transmitted by Markov processes through the network defined by contacts between atoms and residues. The goal is to study how different parts of the assembly respond to the perturbation, with the response of residues revealing biologically important information. The approach, termed Perturbation Markov Transmission (PM), monitors time-dependent responses of all residues from the moment of perturbation until equilibrium is reached. This method can be modified to study signal pathways by applying perturbation to a local region, such as a surface. It is effective for large assemblies requiring minimal computational time.

The PM model was applied to the Gro-Gro chaper system, identifying functionally important residues and signal transduction mechanism. Predictions had an accuracy of 71-84% compared to literature studies. The approach is general and can be applied to other machineries, such as the capsid and ribosomal complex.
Researchers investigated the role of fungal galectins, a type of carbohydrate-binding proteins found in fungi, in defense against predators. They used Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm, as a model organism to test the nematotoxicity of Coprinopsis cinerea galectin C2 (CGL2). Feeding C. elegans with E. coli expressing CGL resulted in inhibited development and killing of the nematode. A carbohydrate-binding defective C2 variant and resistance of C. elegans mutant in GDP-fucose biosynthesis suggested C2-mediated nematity depends on interaction between galectin and fucose-containing glycojugate. A screen for C2-resistant mutants identified glycojugate as Gal1,4Fuc1,6 modification of C. elegans N-gly cores. Analysis of N-gly structures in wild and C2-resistant nemodes confirmed this finding and identified a putative glycosylase required for biosynthesis of glycopeptide. X-ray structure of complex between C2 and Gal1,4uc,6Glc trischar at 1.5 resolution revealed biophysical basis for interaction. Results suggest fungal galect play role in defense against predators by binding glycojugates of organisms.
Researchers have investigated the impact of latent reservoirs of latently infected CD4 T cells on the evolution of HIV within and between hosts. They developed a within-host quasis model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir and nested it into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. For biologically plausible parameters, the presence of a reservoir severely delays within-host evolutionary dynamics, with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation leading to longer delays. These delays change the dynamics at the epidemiological scale, allowing the virus to evolve intermediate loads consistent with maximising transmission, rather than high loads predicted by previous models. This effect can be enhanced if similar viruses initiating infection are preferentially transmitted. Results depend on within characteristics, such as reservoir size, with evolution of intermediate loads only occurring when dynamics are sufficiently delayed. The reservoir plays an underappreciated role in both within and between-host evolution. In untreated individuals with active replication, latently infected cells significantly impact the virus evolution, influencing the within-host rate and population evolution of virulence. The reservoir may explain lower rates of evolution at the epidemi scale compared to within individuals and high heritability of viral load despite transmission events. A quasis model of within-host dynamics incorporating a latently reservoir supports this. Delays caused by the reservoir have a large impact on how the virus evolves at the epidemi level, potentially explaining intermediate levels of virulence maximising transmission under certain conditions.
Researchers investigated how the Coxsackievirus B3 (CV3) virus evades the host immune system by inhibiting antigen presentation through the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway. They used transgenic CD4 and CD8 T cells as sensors to evaluate in vitro and in vivo antigen presentation by CV3 and found that the virus almost completely inhibits antigen presentation via MHC I, thereby evading CD8 T cell immunity. In contrast, presentation of CV3-encoded MHC II epitopes is relatively unaffected, and CV3 induces in vivo CD4 T responses that are phenotypically normal, displaying an effector phenotype and maturing into multi-functional CV3-specific CD4 T cells. These cells expand following infection and differentiate into secondary effector cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines. The findings have implications for the efficiency of antigen presentation during Coxsievirus infection.
A randomized double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisone and oral prednisone versus intravenous saline and oral prednisone in individuals with leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Forty-two participants were randomized to receive methylprednisone followed by predone (n=20) or predone alone (n=22). No significant differences were found in adverse events or clinical improvement at study completion. However, individuals treated with methylprednis were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and 113. Fifty percent of participants with Type 1 reactions/nerve impairment required additional predone despite 16 weeks corticosteroids. The study supports prolonged corticosteroid treatment for Type 1 reactions and investigation of recurrence factors during corticoid treatment. High-dose intravenous methylprednis has been used in Th1 diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis to switch immune response. Methylpred was investigated in lepro Type 1 and nerve impairment. Methylpred did not have larger effect than predone on symptoms and signs in this study.
Researchers investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in modulating CD8 T cell responses in chronic HIV infection. They found that Treg from HIV-infected patients (Treg/HIV) did not inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8 T function, suggesting a defect in suppressive capacity or lack of sensitivity of effector T cells. However, T/H+ inhibited IFNγ expression of autologous CD8 T stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-specific CD8 T. Cross cultures showed T/H- inhibited differentiation of CEF or HIV-specific CD8 T from infected patients. PD-1 and PD-L expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8 T compared to CEF CD8 T, and did not change after T depletion or co-culture with T/H- unlike C-specific CD8 T. The study suggests a defect in T/H modulating differentiation and PD-1/P-L on HIV CD8 cells, contributing to exhaustion of HIV-specific responses. Treg from HIV donors with controlled viral load inhibited differentiation of naïve CD T into CCR- CDRA EM cells and favored accumulation of cells with CM CDRA+CCR+ phenotype. Results indicate impairment of T function and responsiveness of effector clones, associated with high PD-1/P-L levels. In cross cultures, T/H- suppressed IFγ expression by HIV-specific CD8 better than patients' T (mean inhibition 53±12 vs 22; P 0.05).
Researchers evaluated the potential of Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-transferase (GST) as a vaccine candidate for lymphatic filariasis. They cloned the GST gene from the third larval stage (L3) DNA of W. bancroft and expressed and purified the recombinant GST (rWGST). Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area showed significant levels of anti-WGST IgG antibodies compared to those who were microfilaric or had clinical symptoms. Isotype analysis revealed a predominance of IgG1 and Ig3 antibodies in endemic individuals. Functional analysis of rGST showed the protein retained enzymatic activity and antibodies from endemic sera inhibited this activity. Similar results were obtained with anti-rGST antibodies raised in mice in neutralization assay. Brugia mal GST and WGST showed significant similarity. To evaluate vaccine potential, rGST was used B. mal L3 challenge in jirds. Initial studies confirmed role of human and mouse WGST in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. Subsequent vaccination showed approximately 61% protection against B. mal L3 infection in jirds immunized with rGST. Results indicate rGST is a potential candidate against lymphatic filariasis, achieving nearly 61% protection in jird model. The study also showed WGST retained enzymatic activity, critical for parasite survival in host.
CRISPR-Cas technologies have revolutionized genome editing of experimental organisms and hold immense therapeutic potential, but concerns remain over potential off-target effects. Recent studies have addressed these concerns using whole-genome sequencing of edited embryos to search for de novo mutations, which may represent changes introduced by editing. However, these studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish generational or colony differences from true mutations. This study used a trio design and sequenced parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were edited with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. Detailed analysis revealed that if CRIS mutagenesis caused SN or indel off-target mutations in embryos, the number was not distinguishable from background mutations due to other processes. This supports efforts to develop CRPR-C9 as a therapeutic tool.
Researchers have identified two proteins, Hypersensitive to Red 1 (HR1) and Phosphatase 7 (PP7), that play a crucial role in controlling stomatal aperture in Arabidopsis plants. Stomatal pores on the leaf epidermis regulate CO2 uptake for photosynthesis and water loss by transpiration, and their aperture affects photosynthesis, water efficiency, and crop yields. Blue light is an environmental signal that regulates stomatal opening, perceived by blue/UV-absorbing cryptochromes phototropins. The study found that mutations in HR1 or PP lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both HR1 and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transition. HR1 interacts with PP through its N-terminal zinc finger motif and requires PP for stomatal response. HR1 is phosphorylated in vivo, and PP dephosphylates HR1. In the dark, HR1 is dephosphylated in a 193kDa complex, and blue increases to 285Da. In PP mutant, this shift is impaired, and HR is predominantly phosphorylated. The study proposes modification of HR by PP under blue is essential for proper conformation and assembly of HR complex. Guard cells control stomatal response to multiple stimuli.
The Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in adapting Caenorhabditis elegans to ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotics. Depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene abrogates induction of detoxification genes in response to certain xeniotics and heavy metals, rendering animals hypersensitive to exposure. M-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, as M-15 functional defects do not abrogate other stress responses, such as thermotolerance. M-15 integrates transcriptional pathways to monitor the availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotics. M- expression is required for detoxification of xeniotics and heavy metals, interacting with at least two regulatory factors, N-49 and SB-1. M- also regulates fatty acid metabolism, interacting with SB-1, the C elegans ortholog of mammalian sterol regulatory binding proteins. M- expression affects energy genes that respond to food supply and detox genes that respond to environmental contaminants. Intriguingly, expression of M- targets is affected by mutations that alter life span, and stress is believed to contribute to life extension in C. elegans.
Researchers propose a topological paradigm for hippocampal map formation using persistent homology, a field of algebraic topology. They hypothesize that the pattern of neuronal co-firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information and since coiring implies spatial overlap of place fields, the encoded coiring will be based on connectivity and adjacency, a topological map. They test this hypothesis with a model of hippocamp activity varying parameters firing rate, place size, and number of neurons in simulations of rat trajectories in topologically and geometrically distinct environments. Using a computational algorithm based on persistent homology, they find that patterns of coiring convey topological information about the environment in biologically realistic time. Simulations reveal a "learning" region that highlights the interplay between parameters combining to produce hippocamp states more or less adept at map formation. They propose this region provides a theoretical lens to view conditions impairing spatial learning by altering cell rates or specificity.

The study investigates whether hippocamp states, defined by variations in firing, rate, place size, and number, affect network ability to encode topological information. Two ways to build simplicial complexes describe top information in cell activity: place geometry or spike trains. They investigate topological map derived from spiking using algebraic tools, showing requirements for activity to produce stable map and experimentally observed firing satisfy. Place fields cover environment a theorem: sufficient regions reconstruct space from overlaps. They propose hippocampus creates connectivity from coiring patterns.
This study aimed to elucidate the molecular determinants and dynamics of hepatitis C virus (HCV) secretion by combining RNA interference (RNA) analysis of host factors involved in infectious HCV secretion with live cell imaging of HCV trafficking. The RNA screen identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP vesicles and proteins, and recycling endosomes. The results support a model where HCV is enveloped at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. An infectious HCV with a tetrysteine (TC) tag in the core was constructed to monitor core dynamics in association with cellular cofactors. Only trafficking events requiring essential H assembly factor NS2 were quantified. TC trafficked to the periphery microtubules, inhibited by nocodazole, while subpopulations localized to Gol and co-trafficked with recycling endosome components. Silencing recycling end component Rab11 resulted in H core accumulation at Gol. Majority trafficked with apolipoprotein (ApoE) and VAMP vesicles. This study identified new cofactors of H egress and dynamic trafficking in infected cells.
A study investigated the role of the imprinted gene Grb10 in tumorigenesis, specifically in the context of the Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. Mice were heterozygous for NF1 and exposed to radiation, resulting in the development of malignant tumors. Analysis of tumor cell lines from these mice revealed the absence of Gr10 expression. Gr10 is an imprinted gene, and analysis of cell lines and tumors showed that the expressed allele is commonly lost in NF mutant tumors. Functional studies tested whether Gr10 restoration or loss altered tumor features. Restoring Gr10 in NF mutant tumors decreased proliferation, soft agar formation, and downregulated Ras signaling. Conversely, Gr10 silencing in untransformed mouse fibroblasts increased proliferation and Ras-GTP levels. Expression of constitutively activated MEK rescued cells from Gr10-mediated reduction in colony formation. These studies show Gr10 loss can occur in tumorigenesis, with consequences in untransform primary cells. In tumors, Gr10 loss promotes Ras hyperactivation, a feature of tumor development.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues through Pavlovian fear conditioning, a fundamental skill found in many species. They compared different computational models of learning, including probabilistic and non-probabilistic models, to predict trial-by-trial activity of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses, specifically skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PSR). A probabilistic learning model best explained ANS responses, with SCR tracking a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, and PS tracking expected outcome alone. This suggests that Pavlov threat formation in humans relies on probabilistic inference and estimation of uncertainty, informing theories of neural implementation of aversive learning. The study used a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of AN responses. Pavlovian conditioning involves associative learning between predictive cues (conditioned stimuli) and aversive (unconditioned stimuli) events. Historically, models have been developed for reward learning, not threat. The study arbitrated between associative models by comparing predictions to measured AN responses, examining which quantities reflected AN output. Considered models learned probabilities in environmental structure, rather than learning itself or underlying causes. Proposed models derived from reinforcement learning theory and Rescor-Wagner and Pearce-Hall rules. A Bayesian model assumed a probabilistic representation of threat. Overt behavior in Pavlov fear, such as freezing, is limited in humans, so autonomic readouts were used to quantify fear.
Researchers have identified a new regulator, PomA, of the septation network (SIN) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, which plays a crucial role in asexual reproduction. PomA suppresses septation and conidiation, and its overexpression abolishes septation. Under normal conditions, Sep positively regulates the phosphorylation of MAPK HogA, while Pom reverses this process. In the absence of Pbs, a putative upstream kinase of Hog, Pom and Sep are unable to affect Hog phosphorylation. Under osmotic stress, phosphorylated Hog bypasses the requirement of Sep, a key player in early cytokinesis, but not Mob/Sid, last in the SIN kinase cascade, indicating osmotic-induced septation bypasses Sep requirement but not SIN. Findings demonstrate crosstalk between SIN and MAP pathways. Pom and Sep indirectly regulate Hog phosphorylation through Hog upstream kinases. Sep, a homolog of Cdc7 kinase in yeast, is a main regulator of SIN in A. nidans. Pom, a putative kinase, localizes to spindle bodies and hyphal tips, suppresses Sep, involved in septation and conidiation. Sep positively regulates Hog phosphorylation, while Pom reverses this process. Sep and Pom coordinately regulate Hog phosphorylation, playing key role in septation and conid. Sep defects in sep1 may be due to reduced Hog-P. Phosphorylated activation of MAP may play role in septation and conid. Sep, key in cytokinesis, and Sid, last in SIN kinase cascade, are required for septation.
A study investigated the association between the presence of Leishmania virus 1 (LRV1) and mucosal manifestations of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in 156 patients in Brazil. Tegary leishias is endemic in Latin America, with approximately 20,000 cases per year, and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Clinical manifestations vary from cutaneous leishias (CL) to severe disseminated leishias (DL), mucosal leishias (ML), and diffuse cutaneous leish (DCL). The study found five Leish species: 121 (77.6%) Leishmania (Viann) braziliensis, 18 (11.5%) Leish (V) guyensis, 3 (1.8) Leish (V) laini, 2 (1.3) Leish (Leish) amazonensis, and 2 (1.3) Leish (V) shawi. LRV was detected in 54 L. brazili, 5 L. guy, 2 L. amazon, 1 L laini, and 6 inconclusive samples. Patients with CL+ML and DCL were excluded from analysis. Association between LRV and disease was tested among 147 patients (CL=109 and ML=38). 71.1% (n=27) muc lesions were LRV+ and 28.9% (n=11) LRV-. Cutaneous lesions 36.7% (n=40) LRV+ and 63.3 (n=69) LRV-. The ratio LRV+/LRV- was 2.93 (95%CI 1.57-5.46; p<0.001), indicating LRV association with mucosal leishias, as in animal models. LRV not the only factor contributing disease.
Type I interferon (IFN) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumocococcal disease by inhibiting bacterial transmigration from the lung to the bloodstream. Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against type I interferon exhibited enhanced bacteremia following intranasal pneumoc infection, while maintaining bacterial numbers in the lung. Treatment with IFβ or IF-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C) reduced bacteremia following intranas infection with Streptoccus pneumoniae. IFβ led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of pneumoccal receptor plate activating factor (PAF receptor. In accordance, IF reduced pneumoc invasion and trans across epithelial and endothelial layers, and Ifnar− mice showed enhanced lung permeability. Data identify IF as an important component of host defense regulating mechanisms involved in pneumoc invasion, i.e. PAF-mediated transcytosis and tight-dependent perellular migration, limiting progression from localized lung to invasive disease.
Researchers have developed a neural network with multiple layers that utilizes both reward-modulated and non-rewardulated spike-dependent plasticity (STDP) to learn a complex foraging task. The network consists of three layers: an input, hidden, and output. The hidden layer employs nonward STDP, allowing it to respond to specific combinations of inputs and perform basic pattern classification. The output layer implements rewarded ST, enabling the network to learn discrimination between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled data. Synaptic noise facilitates trial-and-error learning, identifying effective strategies for solving the task. This study demonstrates that a set of spiking network properties with ST can solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision-making. 

The network is an extension of a single-layer model previously designed to perform foraging in a virtual environment. It incorporates two layers with both rewarded and nonward ST, with one-to-many connections from input to hidden and all from hidden to output. The multilayer network outperforms the single-layer model in discrimination between elementary food patterns. STDP has been applied to pattern recognition and rewarded ST to overcome the reward problem, but this study combines both in a single model for high performance in discrimination and decision-making. The study links unsupervised ST and rewarded ST in a new way, showing interaction between plastic mechanisms for complex task-solving. Synaptic plasticity follows rules and rewarded ST paradigm between layers, nonward ST between input and hidden.
A study investigated the role of the transcription factor ELF5 in driving metastasis in luminal breast cancer. During pregnancy, ELF establishes the milk-secreting alveolar cell lineage by driving a fate decision of the mammary luminal progenitor cell. In cancer, ELF is a key determinant of tumor subtype and has been implicated in development of insensitivity to antiestrogen therapy. In a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, induction of ELF increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood permeability in primary tumors and greatly increased size and number of metastases. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, a group of immature neutrophils recently identified as mediators of vasogenesis and metastasis, were recruited to tumor in response to ELF. Depletion of these cells using LyG antibodies prevented ELF from vasogenesis and metastasis. Expression in luminal breast cancers indicated increased myel invasion and inflammation correlated with ELF, and ELF immunohistochemical staining predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival of luminal patients. In a mouse model, increased ELF drove metastasis by co-opting the immune system. ELF has been implicated in development of antiest resistance, this finding implicates ELF as factor in acquisition of lethal phenotype in luminal breast cancer.
Recent experiments have shown that the interaction between chromatin loops, characterized by connection pattern, distance, and communication, plays a crucial role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. A model was developed to address how changes in these factors affect expression in a systematic rather than case-by-case fashion. The model maps three patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of transcription, showing that side-by-side loops enhance expression and reduce noise, while alternating loops have opposite effects. Facilitated and direct looping on gene expression were compared, with facilitated performing better in controlling expression and tuning noise, but control is distance-dependent, with a limit where the difference between forms disappears. Analysis justifies the chromatin-looping hypothesis.

 Experiments provided evidence for influence of loop pattern, distance, and form on expression, but impact on cell-to variability remains unclear. A stochastic model was developed to map patterns into a multistate model of expression. Connection between DNA loops and rates also affect expression, depending on distance between elements and other pairs. Experimental results support settings as follows: transcription complexity is in ordered interactions among elements, including loop formation and DNA interactions, leading to stochastic transcription and variability. Without communication, nested loops promote expression but reduce noise, while alternating reduce mean but enlarge, compared to side-by loops.

To quantify variability, transition rates between active and inactive states on loop lengths are needed, as different lengths lead to expression.
Researchers have developed a new approach to design riboregulators, also known as translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), which can repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. To create this framework, they analyzed 12 structural and thermodynamic features previously attributed to post-transcriptional modulation. From an in silico generated ribg library, 18 ribgulators were selected and coexpressed with target regions to link inhibiting RNA features to functionality. Experimental results showed repression of up to 60% of original protein levels, partially explained by ordinary least squares model. A partial least squares model was constructed to link properties of tiRNAs to repression, indicating both structural and thermodynamic features are important for efficient gene repression. This approach enables reliable de novo engineering of effective ribg, expanding RNA toolbox for gene modulation.
Researchers recorded local field potential (LFP) activity at multiple sites in the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cortex cultures to investigate how transient associations among neurons occur and can be identified. They found that when the activity of a local group of neurons exceeds a threshold, its pattern, reflected in LFP, occurs without distortion at other sites via synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, called coherence potentials, extend hundreds of milliseconds and periods, marking loss-less spread of temporal information like action potentials at single-cell level. Coherence potentials have additional freedom in diversity of waveforms, providing high-dimensional parameter for encoding and identification of associations. This behavior is analogous to spread ideas and behaviors in social networks.

The study used spectral coherence in LFP and synchronization of individual neurons to identify functionally associated groups at cortical sites during responses to stimuli. Evidence of recurrent interactions was described in propagation waves across cortical areas, raising questions about propagation of coherence across regions and interaction of potentials. LFPs were shown to organize as neuronal avalanches, suggesting preservation of temporal characteristics of underlying activity. Temporal properties of LFP serve better predictors behaviors than spikes, consistent with coherence propagation representing transfer of information in network.

The study looked for preservation of underlying pattern activity with coherence propagation. LFP represent activity of several hundred neurons, but only small units close to electrode can be resolved, sampling contributing to aggregate.
Researchers conducted a systematic genetic screen in fission yeast to identify factors involved in nuclear size control. The study found 25 essential genes that alter nuclear size and implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in this process. The screen revealed a range of nuclear phenotypes, from smaller to larger, and identified cellular processes and structural components important for size regulation. Bioinformatic analysis supported the role of RNA and LINC complexes in size control. In fission yeast, nuclear volume increased with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant nuclear to cell ratio throughout interphase, with a sudden increase in size accompanying DNA replication in S phase. Schizoscharomyces pombe, a genetically tractable organism with closed mitosis, was used to probe the mechanism of size in vivo. A screen of non-essential deletion mutants implicated nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis in size. This suggests regulation of global processes, nucleoplasmic transcription and cytoplasm translation, and structural nucleus components are important for size. In multicellular organisms, the ratio varies between cell types but is restricted to a narrow range for each. Evidence suggests volume is determined by volume or related to it, not directly by DNA. Volume correlates with across a range in both budding and fission yeasts.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET) by using coupled oscillators to represent neurons generating pathological oscillations. The model, based on the Kuramoto reduced form, analyzes how patients respond to stimulation when oscillations have a given phase and amplitude under certain conditions. The study found that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and have a greater effect when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. This prediction was compared with data from ET patients, and a new hybrid strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive DB was proposed. The model's phase-dependent effects have been shown to generalize to other models and biologically realistic neural circuits, but not directly compared to closed-loop DB effects. Two closed-loop approaches, adaptive and phase-locked DB, were considered, with adaptive DB applying high stimulation when oscillations exceed a threshold and phase-locked at the instantaneous phase, typically 5 Hz for ET. The study aimed to describe how neural oscillators give rise to LFP and tremor oscillations, using coupled models with individual neurons producing spikes and phase-dependent functions. The response curve (RC) describes changes in oscillations as a function of stimulation phase, making them suitable for phase-locked effects. Coupled models have described DB effects at particular phases, with optimal intensity depending on phase.
Researchers have developed a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, named Biom-LAMP, to detect Schistosoma mansoni in Biomphalaria glabr snails, the intermediate host of the parasite causing intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis. The assay targets a 28S-18 rRNA ribosomal intergenic sequence and has a detection limit of 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. BiomAMP was evaluated in experimentally infected snails exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure: prepatent period, light infections, and detection of infected snails in pooled samples. DNA extraction was performed using a commercial kit or simple NaOH method. BiomAMP detected S. mans DNA in all snail groups with no complicated procedure. The assay is specific, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective for screening intermediate hosts with S. mans in individual snails and pooled samples. It is suitable for large-scale surveys in schistosomiasis endemic areas. This study contributes to schosias elimination efforts by providing a field-applicable diagnostic for snail monitoring.
A study was conducted to estimate the public costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most urbanized district in Sri Lanka, during the epidemic year 2012. The Ministry of Health's perspective was used, focusing on operational and administrative costs. Due to the official reporting system capturing few ambulatory deng cases, the analysis was limited to hospitalized deng cases. Costs borne by public agencies for d control in Col district during 2012 were collected and retrospectively analyzed, excluding external costs. The total d response cost was estimated at $3.45 million, with $1.50 per capita. Personnel accounted for 79% of control costs and 46% of hospitalizations. The per capita cost for control was $0.42. Hospitalization costs ranged $216-609 for pediatric and $196-866 for adult cases, depending on severity and treatment. This is the first assessment of d burden in the public sector in Sri Lanka. The results suggest d poses a significant economic burden on the sector.
Recent studies have debated the contributions of Paleolithic hunter-gather and Neolithic farmers from the Near East to modern European populations. Haplogroup Rb1b2 (R-M269) is the most common European Y-chromosome lineage, increasing in frequency from east to west and carried by 110 million European men. Previous studies suggested a Paleolithic origin, but this study shows the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity is best explained by spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic. This indicates most European Y chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion. This pattern contrasts with maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, suggesting a unique role for males in the transition. The Neolithic expansion of Y-chromosome lineages is linked to technological and cultural change. Other lineages, such as E1b1 (M) and J, also show evidence of Neolithic expansion. The majority of European Y chromosomes originate from the Neolithic. Studies of equivalent lineages to Rb2 suggested a Paleolithic origin based on high frequency in the west, but this study shows the distribution is best explained by spread from a single source in the Near East during the Neolithic. Mitochondrial DNA presents a different picture, with no east-west line and most lineages showing Paleolithic signatures. Y-chromosome lineages can be defined by microsatellites, applied to E, J, and I in Europe, but not the major western lineage. The frequency of Rb2 follows a line from 12% in Turkey to 85 in Ireland and is carried by 110 million men.
A recent study investigated the relationship between motor variability and learning, suggesting that it can have both positive and negative effects on the speed of learning. Computational modeling of motor adaptation showed that variability can impact learning in various ways, including slowing it down. Experimental results also found decelerating effects, while a meta-analysis of published papers revealed no statistical relation between movement variability and learning rate across a wide range of experiments. Motor learning is a complex process that can be modeled, but further research is needed to understand the importance of involved factors.

 Simulations showed that increased variability does not typically enable faster learning and can even slow it down, but does not preclude a possible positive correlation between motor and learning rate. Factors can affect learning and variability in distinct ways, leading to positive, negative, or zero relations between them. It's hypothesized that variability is correlated with learning in a task-specific way, depending on which factor affects performance. Computer simulations of error-based learning with an accepted model showed variability as a problem for neural control of movements and received attention. Studies on relation with learning are sparse, except that reduction is a characteristic of learning.

Simulations suggest the relation between variability and rate varies in adaptation, depending on which factor dominates performance in a task. Divergent results in experiments can be explained by taking into account uncertainty or noise. Over trials, people converge to solutions where variability minimally impacts accuracy. A study suggested initial can predict learning in tasks and adaptation, showing a facilitatory effect for error-based adaptation.
Researchers have analyzed the interaction between RelA, a member of the NF-κB family, and CB/p300, a transcription coactivator, to understand its role in NF-κ-driven transcription. RelA interacts with CB/p300 through two components: the DNA-binding domain of Rel with the K domain of CB/p300 and the transcription activation domain (TAD) of Rel with the TAZ domain of CB300. Phosphorylation of a conserved Rel (Ser276) is necessary for the first interaction and crucial for overall Rel:CB/p300. The researchers used NMR spectroscopy to solve the structure of the Rel:CB complex, revealing the folding of Rel-TA2 upon binding to TAZ through conserved hydrophobic sites. Mutational and isothermal analyses allowed design of Rel-mutants that selectively abrogated distinct components of Rel:CB/p300. Studies using cell-based techniques, modeling, and genome-wide expression showed a major set of Rel-activated genes affected by this interaction. The interaction controls NF-κ response through a negative loop of the NF-κ pathway. Chromatin analyses of Rel target promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CB300, indicating a role in Rel recruitment to target sites.
Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TSA) is a method for analyzing longitudinal gene expression data that extends gene set analysis to consider predefined groups of genes. It uses random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates to handle repeated measurements, including unbalanced data due to missing at random (MAR) measurements. TSA is a hypothesis-driven method that identifies a prior-defined gene sets with significant variations over time, accounting for heterogeneity within sets. When comparing biological conditions, it indicates if patterns of sets differ significantly. The method was applied to two real datasets: the DAL-1 trial and a study on influenza and pneumococ vaccines. In the DAL-1 trial, TSA revealed significant change in expression within 69 gene sets over time, while standard univariate analysis and Gene Set Enrich Analysis (GSEA) for time failed to detect patterns. Applied to the second dataset, TSA identified 4 sets linked to influenza, previously associated with pneumoc vaccine. A simulation study showed TSA's good statistical properties and increased power compared to other approaches for time-course gene set analysis. The method is available through an R package.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of the global distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a malaria parasite that has received less attention than Plasmodium falciparum, to inform control and elimination strategies. They updated the geographical limits of P. viv transmission and used 9,970 geopositioned parasite rate surveys from 1985-2010 with a spatiemp Bayesian model to estimate endemicity-standardized rates within 5x5 km grid squares. The model incorporated Duffy negativity to suppress endemic predictions, particularly in Africa. Endemic was predicted within a narrow range, with point rarely exceeding 7%. The Americas contributed 22% of global area risk, but high areas were sparsely populated and contributed 6% of 2.5 billion people at risk. Africa was constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5% global. Central was home to 82% global with high areas in India and Myanmar. South Asia had highest endemic in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, contributing 9%. The map is intended to contribute to geographically-based planning for P. viv control and elimination. 

The model-based geostat (MB) was used, a robust framework for generating surfaces based on retrospect parasite survey data. MB models predict values as a function of geographically-vary mean and weighted proximal points. Parasite data do not measure multiplicity, an effect between prevalence and transmission. The map is influenced by the fraction of population negative for the Duffy antigen, refractory to P. viv. falcum, used in falcum global maps. This presents a comprehensive evidence on P. viv worldwide and global risk. Validation showed minimal bias in predicted Pv with mean error -0.41 (Americas -1.38, Africa 0.03, Central -0.43, South -0.43).
Staphylococcus aureus expresses several cell-wall anchored proteins that mediate adhesion and invasion of host tissues and immune evasion, contributing to its virulence. The cell-anchored protein clumping B (ClB) has been shown to facilitate S. aureus nasal colonization through high affinity with the cornified envelope in the nares. However, the role of ClB during skin and soft tissue (SSTI) has not been investigated. This study reveals a novel role for ClB during STIs. ClB is crucial in abscess structure and bacterial burden in early infection and is dependent on interaction with loric, expressed in abs tissue. Targeting ClB using a vaccine induced both humoral and cellular responses, leading to protection against S. aure skin infection. This identifies Cl as an antigen for future ST vaccines.
Researchers developed a stochastic framework to predict the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV, using dolutegravir (DT) as an example. The framework integrates pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and viral factors to assess prophylactic efficacy. It predicts plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50-90% and 90% sexual transmissions, respectively. Daily oral EP with 50mg DT prevented 99-100% and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. EP 'on-demand' prevented 79-84 and 80% when initiated within 6 hours after exposure and continued as long as possible. The framework can be adapted to other EP candidates, indicating oral 50 DT is non-inferior to Truvada. Predicted 90% concentrations guide release kinetics of developed DT nano-formulations. The study aimed to develop a method integrating PK/PD and viral characteristics to assess prophylactic strategies, allowing intelligent design of once-daily, episodic EP, and simulating on- and off-event driven EP or long-acting formulations. Simulations suggest initiating prophyl earlier has more effect than prolonging P, arguing for immediate P in known or suspected exposure. Once daily EP with Trada provides 96% protection in adherent individuals, but adherence is difficult to quantify. A surrogate is based on detectable drug. EP efficacy is a multivariate interplay of viral and host factors, lacking translational tools to integrate knowledge and rationalize agents and regimens. Predictive models can rule out or prioritize regimens, reducing clinical failure and costs.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces autophagy to enhance its replication, but the regulation of the autophagic pathway by HCV remains unclear. This study demonstrates that HCV induces the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. The induction of Rub by HCV is prompt, whereas induction of UVR is delayed, resulting in accumulation of autagosomes at early points of viral infection. Rubicon inhibits maturation of autag in H-infected cells, confirmed by siRNA knockdown and overexpression of Rub, which enhances and suppresses maturation of autag, respectively. Rub plays a positive role in H replication, suppression of its expression reduces H replication and overexpression enhances replication. In contrast, overexpression of UVR facilitates maturation of autag and suppresses H replication. The H subgenomic RNA replicon, expressing nonstructural proteins, induces Rub and accumulation of autag. Analysis indicates H NS4 protein sufficient to induce Rub and autag. Results indicate H, by differentially inducing Rub and UVR, temporally regulates autagic to enhance replication.
Cyclin-like 1 (Cny1) is a newly identified member of the cyclin family that shares high sequence similarity with Cyclin (Cny). However, its function in organisms is poorly characterized. This study found that Cny1 is highly expressed in the testis of mice, seven times higher than Cny. Male C1- mice are infertile, while both male and female C- mice display normal fertility, suggesting C1, not C, is indispensable for fertility. Spermatoa from C- mice display impaired motility and thin annulus region/bent head. The study found protein, not mRNA level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CD16) decreased in testis C- mice. Further demonstrated C1 interacted with CD16, increasing stability of both proteins and CD16 kinase activity. Observed alteration of CD16 phosphorylation in presence C1. Identified phosphorylation sites CD by mass spectrometry revealed several modifications N-terminal CD16 indispensable C1 binding and modulation CD16 activity. Results reveal unrecognized role C1 regulating spermatogenesis through interaction and modulation CD16.
Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (E) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated vascular endothelial injury. E. coli hemolysin (E-Hly), a member of the RTX repeats-toxin family, is an E. coli virulence factor of increasing importance. The toxin exists as free E-Hly and E-H associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by E during growth. While the free toxin is lytic to human endothelium, the effects of OM-associated E-H on vascular endothelial and epithelial cells, major targets during E infection, are unknown. Microscopic, biochemical, and flow cytometry analyses of human microvascular endothelial (HMEC) and C-2 cells demonstrate OM-associated E-H does not lyse cells but triggers apoptosis. OM-associated is internalized via dyn-dependent endocytosis and trafficked into endosomal compartments. Upon acidification and pH drop, E-H is separated from OM, escapes lysosomes via pore-forming activity and targets mitochondria, decreasing transmembrane potential and cytochrome translocation to cytos, indicating permeabilization membranes. Subsequent caspase and casp-3 activation leads apoptotic death evidenced DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation. OM-associated E-H triggers apoptotic pathway in microvascular and epithelial cells indicates mechanism E-H involvement in pathogenesis E diseases.
A study in the yeast Schizoscharomyces pombe reveals a positive feedback loop between histone H2 ubiquitylation (H2ub) and the ortholog of metazoan positive elongation factor (PTEb) Cdk, which regulates transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPI). Histone modifications have established roles in transcription initiation, but their functions during elongation are not well understood. H2ub plays a key role in coordinating co-transcription histone modification by promoting site-specific methylation of histone H3 and regulates expression through an unidentified methylation-independent mechanism. The study shows bidirectional communication between H2 and Cdk, where lowering Cdk activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate, transcription factor Spt, reduces H2 in vivo. Conversely, mutations in the H pathway impair Cdk recruitment to chromatin and S phosphorylation. Moreover, an S phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of histone H3 methyltransferase Set phenocopies morph and growth defects due H loss, suggesting partially redundant roles Cdk and Set downstream H. Surprisingly, mutation the histone H ubiqu-acceptor relaxes Cdk activity in vivo and Cdk mutations suppress cell-morph defects H-deficient strains. Genome-wide chromatin analyses demonstrate opposing effects C and H on transcribing RNAPI distribution.
Researchers conducted a phylogenetic analysis of 133 yellow fever virus (YFV) isolates from 22 countries over 76 years to determine the evolutionary history of this reemerging pathogen. The study found that currently circulating YV strains arose in Africa within the last 1,500 years and emerged in the Americas following the slave trade approximately 300-400 years ago. These viruses then spread westwards across the continent and persist to this day in the jungles of South America. The researchers used sequence data to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics and document the role of human migration in the spread of disease. The study included 71 additional prM sequences from GenBank, resulting in an alignment of 133 wild-type isolates representing 22 countries. Phylogen analysis showed YV can be divided into geographic groups with distinct lineages in Africa and Americas. In Africa, outbreaks are reported annually, with five West African cities facing epidemics since 2001. However, analysis revealed no difference in evolutionary dynamics between viruses in South and Africa, with neither exhibiting increases in diversity expected of expansion. The virus established a sylvatic cycle in the Amazon, Aragua, and Orin river basins, vectored by Haemus and Sabeth mosquitoes. The hypothesis of slave introduction has been repeated, but not rigorously examined using sequence and phylogen techniques estimating divergence.
Researchers studied a virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate in an infant mouse model of colonization and disease transmission with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection to identify vulnerable points in pneumoccal pathogenesis. They found that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and transmission between hosts. Passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation of the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission between exit from one host and establishment in another was explained by the number of organisms in secretions, which was critical to overcome. Observations demonstrated that viral infection and T-dependent immune responses stimulated and required to control bacterial contagion.

The study used an animal model to examine the effects of clinically important viral co-infection, finding IAV increased the burden of colonizing pneumocci consistent with prior observations in mice. Targeting stages when bacterial size was restricted, there was less opportunity for selection among phenotypically and genetically diverse pneumocci. The study employed an infant model that recapitulated key pneumoc path features. Regardless of IAV-infection, sampled at 12 days prior to onset, detection of pneumonia by lung homogen culture was unusual. The bottleneck in IAV could be due to selection of pneumoc subpopulation requiring de novo adaptation or passage through existing variants.

A type 6 clinical S pneumonia isolate was tested in an infant model with intranasal challenge at 4 days. An advantage was that mice were susceptible to colonizing low dose. To examine IAV co-infection, mouse-adapt strain 31 was inoculated at 8. To understand mechanisms of protection, steps during infection pneumoc must pass population bottlenecks - a reduction in size due environmental constraints. A bottleneck would occur if only infecting organisms able to pass host or evade local defense.
A study was conducted to evaluate exposure to Phlebotus orient, a vector of Leishmania donov, the causative agent of visceral leishiasis in Eastern Africa, by testing antibody reactions of human sera against recombinant salivary proteins. Recombinant proteins derived from Phbotus secreted salivary proteins were produced using bacterial and mammalian expression systems and tested as antigens for detection of anti-P orient Ig in human sera. Sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, endemic for visceral leishias, were screened by ELISA and immunoblot to identify markers of P orient bites. Two recombin proteins, m5 and mEL, were identified as promising antigens with high correlation and specificity to whole fly saliv gland homogen. Combination of both increased correlation and predictive values of orient exposure. This is the first report of screening sera for anti orient antibodies using recom salary proteins. Recomb proteins mEL and m5 proved valid for screening sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for orient bites. Utilization of both proteins increased detection of anti orient responses. 

Phbotus orient is a vector of Leish donani in Sudan and Ethiopia, causing life-threatening visceral leishias. During blood-feeding, fly females salivate host skin, containing sal proteins eliciting antibody responses. To evaluate exposure in endemic populations, sera were tested against recomant orient salary antigens. Recomb proteins from orient secreted sal proteins were produced using bacterial and mammalian expression and tested as antigens for detection anti orient Ig in sera. Sera from Sudan and Ethiopia were screened by ELISA and immunlot to identify orient bites. Two recom proteins, m and m, were identified as promising with high correlation and specificity to whole fly saliv homogen. Combination increased correlation and predictive of orient exposure. This is first report screening sera for anti orient using recom proteins. Recomb m and proved valid for sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for orient bites. Utilization of both increased detection orient responses.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI) is a mobile genetic element associated with multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteraceae. It is mobilized by IncA and Inc plasmids (A/C plids) following excision from the chromosome, triggered by the transcriptional activator ACD encoded by these plasmids. Although SGI is not self-transmissible, it carries genes NS, HS, and GS, coding for homologs of the mating pore subunits NC, HC, and GC, respectively, encoded by A plids. This study investigated the regulation of NS and HS and the role of these genes in transmissibility of SGI. Transcriptional fusion of promoter sequences NS and HS to reporter gene lacZ confirmed expression is inducible by ACD. Mating experiments using combinations of mutants SGI and Inc plid pCR revealed interactions between two mobile elements. While NC and HC are essential for Inc plid transfer, SGI rescued mutants of each gene, revealing NS, HS, and GS are functional. Complementation of mutants showed that not only NS/HS replace NC/HC in pore encoded by plids but also GS and HS are required for SGI optimal transfer. Remodeling of Inc-encoded pore by SGI enhanced transfer rate of SGI over plid. Furthermore, GS allowed transfer between cells bearing Inc plids, suggesting SGI disables Inc-encoded exclusion mechanism. Tra genes facilitate invasion of SGI in populations bearing plids.
Researchers investigated the role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo kinase C5 (CDC5) in the DNA damage checkpoint response, a mechanism that allows cells to adapt to persistent or irreparable DNA damage and escape cell cycle arrest. They found that CDC5 is required for adaptation and its overexpression promotes faster adaptation, indicating that high levels of CDC modulate the checkpoint's ability to inhibit the cell cycle machinery. To pinpoint the step in the pathway where CDC acts, they overexpressed CDC from the GAL promoter in damaged cells and examined key checkpoint steps individually. CDC overproduction had little effect on early steps leading to Rad53 activation, but significantly reduced Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, consistent with loss of cell arrest during adaptation. They conclude CDC attenuates the damage through loss of Rad53 hyperosphorylation to allow cells to adapt DNA. This mechanism is conserved in vertebrates, as polo kinase homologs inhibit the ability of Clpin to activate downstream kinases. In S. cerevisiae, unable to repair damage will override checkpoint and continue division, a process called adaptation. The timing of adaptation correlated with loss of Rad activity, suggesting adaptation may be a consequence of CDC-mediated inhibition. Studies in eukaryotes provide evidence that polo can inhibit checkpoint after DNA damage. Xenopus hom CDC, Pl1, decreases Chk activity by dissociating Clpin from chromatin. Data suggest CDC does not inhibit Rad-Rad complex formation but blocks Mec-primed Rad molecules to produce hyperphorylated53 in vivo. Adaptation begins after 6-8 hours of arrest if unable to repair, loss signaling correlates with onset.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, the 3D Kirchhoff-Nern-Plan (KNP), to study the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain on large spatial and temporal scales. This is crucial for understanding pathological conditions such as seizures, stroke, and depression, which involve changes in ion concentrations in the ECS. Previous models were limited to small spatial and temporal scales or simplified one-dimensional processes due to computational power requirements. The 3D KNP framework assumes electroneutrality, circumventing charge relaxation processes on nanosecond scales, making it feasible to simulate on millisecond scales on a standard computer. It was applied to a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell, elucidating the neuron's contribution to electrodiff effects in ECS and demonstrating the framework's efficiency. The 3D model predicts ion concentrations in all directions surrounding neuronal sources, applicable to a broader range of biological problems. It addresses diffusion due to ECS gradients on large spatial scales, unlike one-dimensional models. Reaction-diff schemes neglect diffusive effects on ECS and previous studies found low-frequency potential components dominated by diffusion. The 3D KNP is the first framework to handle 3D electrodiff in tissue at large scales without excessive power, simulating 100-second ion dynamics in 1mm3 on a desktop in a day. It was developed for a hybrid setup with KNP for ECS dynamics and NEON for neurodynamics, sharing limitations of NEON's intracellular handling.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for mosquito-borne disease surveillance, such as deng and West Nile virus, may leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing diseases. A study evaluated the impact of delayed responses to deng epidemics in a developed urban environment, using a mathematical model to generate scenarios of delayed response to deng introduction in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The results were coupled with surveillance and management costs to estimate the cumulative costs of each scenario. The study found that halting surveillance increased epidemic management costs by an order of magnitude compared to sustained surveillance and early detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance were lower than responding to vector-borne pathogens, even considering human lives and well-being. The analysis provides a science-based justification for reassessing the CDC budget cut and emphasizes the need for sustainable vectororne surveillance systems.
A prospective study was conducted in semi-urban and rural Nicaragua to investigate deng as a cause of acute febrile illness in children and adults. A total of 740 patients aged ≥1 year presenting with fever were consecutively enrolled and tested for deng IgG and IgM and serotyped deng virus using reverse transcriptase PCR. The study found that 63.5% of patients were seropositive for deng at enrollment, with seropreval increasing with age, reaching 90% in those over 20 years. Acute deng serotypes 1 and 2 were identified in 5.1% of patients, with only 8.1% of confirmed cases suspected. Dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in western Nicaragua, as Zika virus is transmitted by the same vector and associated with severe congenital infections. The population is at risk of being devastated by the Zika epidemic that has reached Central America. The study identified deng as etiologic responsible for 5.1% of acute febr illnesses, confirmed by paired sera and PCR. The seropreval was 22% in <5 years, 57 in 5-9, 77 in 10-14, 86 in 15-19, 91 in 20-24, 95 in 25-29, and 100 in ≥30. Patients with acute deng had similar clinical features to other febr illnesses, with symptoms and signs independently associated with deng.
Arabidopsis leucine-rich receptor-like kinase NIL1 (NIL1) plays a crucial role in the induction of innate immunity against parasitic nematodes. Plant-paras nematodes cause significant economic losses annually, and effective defense relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Research has been conducted to characterize PT in various plant-pathogen interactions, but less is known about PT in roots and plant-nemat interactions. This study shows that nemat-derived elicitors induce PT in Arabidopsis dependent on the immune receptor BAK. Consistent with BAK's role, NIL1 is identified as a leucine-rich receptor-like kinase regulated upon nemat infection. NIL1 is essential for PT responses initiated by nematodes, and loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to broad nematodes. NIL1 is the first receptor involved in basal immunity PT in plants or animals to nemat. Manipulation of NIL will provide options for nemode control in crops.
Researchers investigated the effect of milteine, an anti-cancer drug, on Schistosoma mansoni worms in vitro. They found that treating adult worms with miline exposed surface antigens not normally hidden from the host during infection. Indirect immunofluorescence assay showed strong binding of rabbit anti-S mansoni worm homate and anti mansoni antisera to S mansoni worm surface after miline treatment. Antisera previously shown to enhance schosidal activity of prazantel. Antibodies to surface antigens exposed by miline were eluted in low pH buffer and used in western blot to identify targets in worm homogen extract. Four proteins reacting were identified: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogen. These also bound to 3-hour schosula surface and induced agglutination, suggesting a role in immune protection. This reveals a novel mode of action for miline as antischistome agent. The study supports previous hypothesis that treatment unmasks parasite antigens not exposed to host during infection. Antigens involved could be targets for intervention and antibodies may increase drug efficacy and prevent re-infection.
Bacillus cereus, an opportunistic pathogen, has evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources, including heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin, a 24-mer protein that stores thousands of iron atoms within its cavity. The molecular basis of iron acquisition from heme and hemoglobin has been extensively studied, but little is known about iron acquisition from ferritin. A surface protein, Ils (Iron-regulated leucine rich surface type A), binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. This study demonstrates Ils acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on bacterial surface. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicates Ils binds several types of ferritins through interaction with shell units. UV-vis data shows significant enhancement of iron release from ferritin in presence of Ils, indicating a bacterial protein can alter ferritin core stability. Disruption of siderophore bacibactin production reduces B. cere ability to utilize ferritin for growth and attenuates bacterial virulence in insects. A new model of iron acquisition in B. cere is proposed, involving Ils binding to ferritin followed by siderore iron uptake. Results highlight interplay between surface protein and siderore, providing insights into B. adaptation and pathogenesis.
Researchers have developed a thermodynamically consistent model of the post-translational circadian clock in the cyanobacter Synechoccus elongatus. The clock is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a hexamer, with each monomer consisting of two domains, CI and CII. Both domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only CII can be phosphorylated at two residues in a defined sequence. The model suggests that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active conformation state where phosphorylation tends to rise and an inactive where it tends to fall. Phosphorylation of CII provides the timer for hydrolysis in CI. The model also explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC by acting as a nucleotide factor and how differential affinity of Kai for different Kai phosphforms generates temporal order of phosphorylation. As phosphorylation in CII rises, release of AD from CI slows, making inactive conformation of Kai more stable. Inactive Kai binds KaiB, stabilizing this state and sequestering Kai, leading to dephosphorylation. A kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm simulates the system, showing the model describes experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) suppresses the innate immune response to establish persistent infection, despite being a DNA virus, its pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) can be sensed by RIG and activates MAV to mediate interferon (IFN) synthesis. However, the mechanism by which HBV fails to induce interferon-β (IFN) synthesis remained uncharacterized. This study demonstrates that HBV-induced parkin recruits the ubiquitin assembly complex (UB) to mitochondria and attenuates IFN synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, accumulates unanchored polyubiquitin chains on MAV via UB, disrupting MAV signalosome and IRF activation. This highlights the novel role of park in antiviral signaling involving UB recruitment to mitochondria. 

Park localized to the mitochond may influence orchestration of mitochond-based antiral during HB infection. HB is considered a stealth due to its ability to evade immunity and cause chronic infection. Reports establish HB cripples R-I-MA signaling and a study shows R-I senses HBpg to stimulate IF production not IF. Notably, perisomal MAV stimulates IF via IR. This advocates the role of park in suppressing MAV signaling via UB recruitment to mitochond. Park interacts with MAV and HB potentiates this interaction. HB activates R-I-MA axis to countermeasures to abrogate IRF activation and IF synthesis. HB induces translocation of park and park-dependent mitagy to promote persistence. Studies implicate dynamics and mitagy in modulation antiral. HB-localized park interacts MAV and causes ubiquination. Park recruits UB to mitochond, leading M-linked polyub chains on MAV, disrupting TRs and IRF activation. Park modulates LAC activity and LAC abrogates MAV via MAV-TR or TRIM. Park silencing restores IF in HB cells upon R-I agonist stimulation.
Researchers have identified a novel superantigen, pT, encoded by the gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, associated with Crohn's disease. The crystal structure of pT was determined at 1.7 Å resolution and its interaction with human class II MHC was analyzed. pT and its homolog, PA5, bound to mammalian cells and stimulated human lymphocyte proliferation, which was inhibited by anti-class II MHC-DR antibodies and to a lesser extent by anti-HLA and DP antibodies, indicating class IIHC-specific binding. pT efficiently precipitated endogenous and purified recombinant HLA-DR molecules, indicating direct interaction with HLA-DR. Competition studies revealed pT and superantigen Mycoplas arthritidis (M) competed for HLA binding, indicating overlapping sites. Structural analysis established pT belongs to the Tet-family of DNA-binding regulators. The structure of p indicates a new family of T superantigens.

p is a distinguishing biomarker for disease and clinical phenotype of Crohn disease, with an intensifying focus on the interplay of microbiota in Crohn disease as a source of antigens in immune activation and microbial products targeting epithelial function. Primary T responses are elicited by microbial superigens via interaction TCRβ elements and in some Tα chains. A novel enteric superigen, p, and its full-length product p, are encoded by a gene associated with Crohn disease. Selective activation was observed for murine T-V5 subpopulation and p exhibited T-cell activity. PA, the Pseudomonas aerugin hom of p (78 sequence) also stimulated murine CD T proliferation. Colonization by p-expressing microorgan in IBD hosts was speculated to provide superigen stimulus pertinent to pathogenesis Crohn disease.
Researchers have investigated the role of allelic patterns of Nanog expression in embryonic stem cell heterogeneity. Nanog is a key regulator of pluripotency, and its expression is known to be dispersed within stem cell populations in vivo and in vitro. Recent studies suggest that allelic control of Nanog influences stem cell fate decisions. A multiscale stochastic population equation framework was developed to understand how allelic regulation affects Nanog heterogeneity in stem cells. The model considered allelic expression, gene noise, and random partitioning at cell division. Results showed that allelic Nanog expression led to three distinct states, but combined with transcription noise, the profile became bimodal. Initially, uniform populations gave rise to same Nan heterogeneity within ten cycles. Depletion of NANOG in cells was slower than accumulation of intracellular NAN after turning on at least one Nan gene, indicating Nan state dynamics. Allelic transcription raises questions about using stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in single locus. Divergence was observed in reporter and protein profiles depending on half-lives insertion in one or both alleles. In stem populations with restricted Nan expression, allelic facilitated maintenance of self-renew cells with sufficient Nan content to prevent pluripotency loss. Findings highlight allelic control of Nanog as determinant of stem population heterogeneity, warranting investigation in cell specification and reprogramming.
Researchers have developed a method to quantify and classify the unused proteins in E. coli, a type of bacteria, across different environments. They found that nearly half of the proteins in E. coli are not used in certain environments, and the cost of these unused proteins explains 95% of the variation in growth rates across 16 different environments. Reducing unused protein expression is a common mechanism for increasing growth in adaptive experiments. The unused proteins encode functions for nutrient and stress preparedness, which may provide benefits in varying environments. This unused expression is a source of large and pervasive costs that may provide benefits against environmental change. A genome-scale model of E. coli and absolute proteomics data were used to determine the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a gene basis. The model, called ME-Model, formalizes the function and synthesis of proteins for metabolism and expression necessary for growth, which is referred to as the proteome. The unused proteins are catalytically active but present in excess and operating at maximal capacity. Overexpression of unused proteins results in a predictable reduction in growth. Microbes express some unused proteins in any environment, reducing growth. The magnitude and variability of unused expression is unknown due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic factors contributing to type 2 diabetes (T2) in three ethnic groups in Southeast Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Indians. The study included 3,955 cases and 1,945 controls, 2,034 cases, and 1,240 controls, and 2,146 cases and 1,169 controls, respectively. The study aimed to identify novel genetic variants associated with T2 and assess the transferability of previous findings from European populations to these ethnic groups. Of the previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with T2, CDKAL and HXIDE/K11 showed the strongest association in a meta-analysis of all three groups. However, the direction of effect was consistent for many other SNPs in this study and European populations. Examination of CDAL and HXIDE11 loci showed evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in association with T2 and variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations. These factors, combined with limited power, may contribute to failure to detect associations in diverse populations. The study highlights the importance of surveying diverse ethnic groups for fine-mapping causal variants and searching population-specific variants. A meta-analysis of the three studies showed strong associations at CDAL and HX11 loci consistently in T studies globally. Signals at CDAL were calibrated, with effect sizes in Chinese and Indian populations similar or larger than European studies. The study is the first GW in Malays, the largest group in Southeast Asia, comprising 300 million. Conditional analysis at CDAL and HX11 was performed by including genotypes as covariates and lead SNPs to assess differences in linkage disequilibrium between populations.
In the budding yeast Cryptococcus neoformans, nuclear division occurs in the daughter cell, where kinetochores cluster and the nucleus moves to the bud during mitosis. Aurora kinase I1 (I1) localizes to the nucleus upon nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis in C. neoans. I1 is required for timely nuclear envelope breakdown and is essential for viability, regulating microtubule stability. Depletion of I1 results in cytoplasmic microtule instability, delaying kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. An in silico modeling predicts cytoplasmic microtules and dynein regulate nuclear division in C. neoans. Introducing additional parameters, the model suggests cortical generated by cytoplasmic B1 and dyin regulates kinetore clustering and migration. In vivo alterations of B1 or dyin levels delay nuclear migration. In silico and live imaging suggest I1 spatiotemporally influences B1/dyin activity and microtule stability ensuring timely division. I1 breakdown the envelope allows nuclear entry, spatiotemporally regulating division in C neoans.

I1 is essential for viability, orchestrating pre-anaphase nuclear movement from mother to daughter in C neoans. It maintains microt stability for timely kinore clustering and migration. In sil study predicts dyin and B1 regulate kinore clustering, prerequisite nuclear migration. I spatiotempor regulates cytoplasm microt and B1/dyin distribution. Absence I impairs cortical bias and microt lengths, kinore clustering and migration. Estimated chromosome segregation fidelity in I1-depleted cells due altered migration and kinore clustering. By regulating B1/din activity, I creates bias for nuclear migration followed division in C neo.
Researchers investigated the role of a synonymous mutation in the RET proto-oncogene in a case of aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the parafollicular cells of the thyroid. The patient had a somatic p.Cys634 mutation, a known driver of MTC, and a germ-line p.C630 substitution, initially considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. Next-generation sequencing revealed the mutations were in cis, with no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis showed increased RET transcript levels in the patient with both mutations compared to 7 MTCs with p.C634 mutations. Minigene assays demonstrated the synonymous mutation was sufficient to explain increased mRNA levels. In silico and immunoprecipitation experiments showed the p.C630 variant created exonic splicing enhancer motifs, enhancing SR55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to efficient pre-mRNA maturation and increased mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active receptor. These findings document a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression.
Researchers have developed a bioinformatics system to remove contaminants and low-complex genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukotic pathogens. This system was applied to a comprehensive database of sequenced eukotic pathogen genomes, removing human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences, as well as low-complex genomic sequences. The resulting database of "clean" eotic pathogen genomes was used for bioinformatics analysis and classification. The new database showed improved sensitivity in identifying eotic pathogens in metagen samples compared to using original genomes, with a significant reduction in false positives. The method was tested on a large set of eotic pathogen genomes, producing a cleaned and filtered database for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those for next-generation sequencing diagnostics, with decreased false and false rates.
Researchers investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda to understand the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region. They genotyped 269 isolates from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesense. The results showed three distinct genetic clusters: cluster 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies (T. b. brucei vs. T. b. rhense) or date of collection. Analyses show genetic admixture among clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent gene flow between them. The expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from northward spread of T. b. rhense (br) and emergence of human infect strains from non-infect T. b. bruce (bb) of different backgrounds. Cattle are a reservoir that shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
Researchers investigated the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) in the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock in mice. They found that TXIP-deficient mice (Tx−/−) were more susceptible to endotoxic shock due to increased nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) production in macrophages. The absence of TXIP led to excessive NO production, which was a major factor in endotoxic shock susceptibility. The researchers also observed reduced IL-1β secretion due to S-nitrosylation of NLR3 in Tx/− mice compared to wild-type controls. Data suggested cross-talk between TXIP and NF-κB/iOS pathways, regulating disease states associated with sepsis. Excessive NO in the absence of TXIP activated the NLR inflamome, with S-nrosylation of NLR3 affecting IL-1 secretion and sensitivity to endotoxin-induced shock. The NF-κ pathway mediated LPS-induced iOS activation in the absence of TXIP, and excessive NO inhibited NLR-dependent IL-1 secretion via S-nrosylation of the NLR inflome. Overall, TXIP negatively modulated NO and iOS expression during L-induced endotoxic shock, with increased iOS and NO production in Tx/− macrophages.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZTF-8 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in repairing DNA damage and double-strand breaks in the germline. The germl mutations in DNA repair genes are linked to tumor progression, and failure to activate a DNA damage checkpoint or repair meiotic double-strand breaks can impair chromosome segregation. ZTF-8 interacts with the 9-1 complex and is required for DNA damage response and double-strand repair in the germl. ZTF-8 mutants exhibit sensitivity to radiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic arrest at S-phase accompanied by activation of ATL-1 and CHK-1 damage kinases, as well as accumulation of mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates, indicating ZTF functions in double-strand break repair. However, impaired meiotic repair partially fails to trigger CEP-1/p53-dependent damage in pachene, supporting a role for ZTF in meiotic. Z-8 co-localizes with the 9-1 complex and interacts M-2, a component of this complex. The human protein rescues phenotypes in z- mutants, suggesting conservation across species. ZTF is involved in promoting at stalled replication and meiotic double-strands by transducing damage signaling via 9-1 pathway. The findings define conserved for ZTF/RINO in genomic stability in germl.
During neural tube development, motor neuron (MN) progenitors differentiate more rapidly than other progenitors. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs, indicating a pivotal role for the determinant O2 (O2) just prior to MN differentiation. O2 represses the Notch signaling effectors Hes1 and H5, with O2 repression of H5 being direct via a conserved element within the H5 locus restricting expression from MN progenitors. These findings demonstrate a tight coupling between patterning and differentiation networks, with O2 acting as a developmental pacemaker coordinating spatial and temporal MN generation.

Notch signaling controls the transition between phases of O2 expression, restraining O2 in MN progenitors. Notch inhibition increases expression of neurogenic markers, and neuronal genes after 12 and 24 hours, suggesting Notch controls the transition between phases of O2 expression. Canonical Not effectors H1 and H5 decrease as cells switch from O2LOW to O2HIGH expression. Inhibiting Not signalling upregulates O2. Distinct O2 dynamics underlie MN to MN progression, raising the question of what upregulates O2 prior MN. Notch pathway controls neurogenesis, and Not inhibition in N triggers differentiation. O2 binding represses H5 through an element, interrupting the oscillator, allowing N2 to reach maximal and differentiation to commence. O2 inserts into the Not-regulated neural program, shutting Not activity, ensuring MN proceeds spatially and temporally controlled.
Researchers investigated the role of T cells in protecting against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in non-human primates using a translational model. They first infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal H1N isolate, which elicited cellular and antibody responses but no neutralizing antibodies against H1p. Four months later, the primed animals and naive controls were challenged with H1p. In naive animals, CD8+ T cells with an activated phenotype appeared in blood and lung 5-7 days post-inoculation, while activated T cells were recruited to lung as early as 2 days post-inoc in primed animals and peaked in blood and lung 4-7 days. Interferon-gamma Elisp and intracellular cytokine staining showed virus-specific response peaked and reached higher in primed than naive animals, involving CD4 and CD8 T cells. Primed animals cleared H1p significantly from upper and lower respiratory tract before neutralizing antibodies appeared. Results suggest cross-reactive T responses mediate early clearance of antigenically novel virus in primates, and vaccines inducing such cells may protect against emerging influenza.
Researchers developed a rapid and sensitive Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay to detect Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, a widespread zoonosis transmitted by domestic animals. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from acute and convalescent stages, unavailable at early diagnosis, while nested PCR and real-time PCR require equipment. The LAMP assay targets the htp gene of C. burnii using a universal primer set designed by Primer Explorer 4. Sensitivity was evaluated with known quantities of reference plasmids and specificity with 26 Rickettsiales and 18 common pathogens. The LAMP was compared to real-time PCR on 24 samples, including 6 confirmed and 18 probable fever cases diagnosed by serological and real-time PCR, and 126 animal samples from 4 provinces. The LAMP detected 1 copy of the h gene with 100 specificity and no cross-reaction among bacteria. The positive rate of febrile patients was 33.3% for LAMP and 8.3 for real PCR (p<0.05) and animals 7.9 for LAMP and 0.8 for PCR (p<0.01). The LAMP is a potential tool for Q diagnosis in humans and animals, especially in rural China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without equipment or complicated protocol.
Researchers have identified a novel class of regulatory elements called embryonic stem (ES)-specific enhancers in hematopoietic cells that are prone to DNA methylation changes in cancer. These enhancers, designated as ESs, are particularly enriched in the hematopoietic lineage and are associated with gene expression in cancer. Methylation of ESs is linked to transcriptional activity, with methylated ESs being hypermethylated in cancer and unmethylated ESs hypomethyl. Constitutive hematopoietic stem-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ESs in cancer. Further analysis of hypomethyl ES downstream the VFA gene revealed a regulatory circuit affecting VFA transcript levels across cancers and patients. The study suggests enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer. DNA methylation is closely linked to enhancer states and expression of cancer genes, and ESs are prone to methylation alterations in cancer. Methylation of ES correlates with VFA expression in cancers, while promoter methylation is not associated with gene expression in DLCL and HCC. Genes proximal to hypomethyl ESs expressed in ES but downregulated in hematiet are upregulated in cancer, suggesting an association between hypomethylation and upregulation. Many of these genes participate in developmental pathways. DNA methylation of ES site affects its activity as a transcription enhancer in leukemia, supporting the sites as cis-regulators of ES reactivation in cancer.
Researchers investigated the effect of subdividing a population on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau in a rugged landscape. They used a generic and minimal model that includes population subdivision into demes connected by migration, without significant changes in deme size, environmental heterogeneity, or geographic structure. The study focused on the optimal speedup of valley crossing that can be gained by subdivision, driven by the dem that crosses the fastest. Results showed that isolated demes must be in the sequential regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, analytical expressions were obtained for the conditions under optimal speed is achieved, where valley crossing by subdivided population is as fast as its fastest dem. Predictions were verified through stochastic simulations. Subdivision was found to accelerate crossing of valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters beyond the optimal. The effect of varying subdivision degree and trade-off between speed and range was investigated. Results for valleys and plateaus also held for weak beneficial mutations. The study was extended to a population connected by migration to one or several islands, showing subdivision alone can accelerate crossing and shedding light on necessary conditions.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypt, the primary mosquito vector for arboviruses such as deng, Zika, chikunya, and yellow fever. They used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze the metabolic perturbations that occur following deng virus infection in the midut tissue, the primary site of infection and replication preceding systemic dissemination. The study identified metabolites exhibited a dynamic profile across early, mid, and late infection time points, with a marked increase in lipid content, specifically glycerophospholids, sphingolids, and acyls coinciding with viral replication kinetics. Elevated glycerolip levels suggested diversion of resources from energy storage to synthetic pathways, while elevated acylcarnines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and energy production. A central hub in the sphingip pathway, dihydroceramide to ceramide ratio, was critical for the virus cycle. The study reconstructed the sphip pathway in Aedes aegi, highlighting biochemical points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by mosquitoes.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of the action potential (AP) in rabbit heart cells, called the "parsimon" model, to better understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias. Existing models are complex and varied, leading to different predictions, so a simpler model is needed to reproduce significant phenomena with few parameters. The new model combines a Hodgkin-Hux formulation of sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological repolarization model similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying potassium current (IK). It was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit cells under physiological conditions: current-voltage (I-V) relationships during AP, rapid recovery of excitability during refractory period, and steady IN inactivation via voltage clamp. The model reproduced important phenomena, including alternans at 250 beats per minute, reentrant waves on the heart surface, and spiral breakup. Variants showed minimal requirements for alternans and spiral breakup: IN inactivation kinetics and non-linear IK rectification. The model's simplicity and physiological parameters make it ideal for mechanistic insight and a building block for more detailed models.
In the ciliate Parameium, the assembly of the somatic genome involves the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences or IES) flanked by TA dinucleotides. Previous studies have shown that these genome rearrangements are initiated by developmentally programmed DNA-strand breaks (DSBs) dependent on the domesticated transposase PigMac. However, the molecular steps involved in the final assembly of somatic genes remained unknown. This study demonstrates that Ligase IV and Xrccp, components of the non-homous endjoining (NHE) pathway, are required for the repair of I excision sites and circularization of excised IES. Transcription of LIG and XR4 is induced during the sexual cycle and Ligp-GFP protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus during I excision. RNA-mediated silencing of either gene results in persistence of free DNA ends, apparently protected from resection. At the nucleotide level, removal of 5-terminal nucleotide occurs in L4-silenced cells, while addition to 3 ends of breaks is blocked, indicative of coupling between NHE polymerase and ligase activities. The data indicate I excision is a cut-and-close mechanism involving introduction of double-strand cleavage at both ends of I, followed by DSB repair via precise joining. This broadens current view on how cellular HE pathway cooperates with domestic transases for emergence of new mechanisms in genome dynamics.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas disease, comparing it with non-Ch cardiomyopathy. They analyzed the REMHE trial, grouping patients according to etiology (Ch vs non-Ch) and mode of death. The primary endpoint was all-cause and heart failure mortality. 342 patients were analyzed, with 185 (54.1%) dying. Death occurred in 56.4% Chagas and 53.7% non-Ch patients. The cumulative incidence of allcause mortality and heart mortality was higher in Ch patients compared to non. There was no difference in cumulative sudden mortality between groups. In Cox model, Ch etiology (HR 2.76, CI 1.34-5.69, p=0.006), LVED (HR 1.07, CI 1.04-1.10, p<0.001), creatinine (HR 0.98, CI 0.97-0.99, p=0.006) and amiodarone (HR 3.05, CI 1.47-6.34, p=0.003) were associated with heart mortality. LVED (HR 1.04, CI 1.01-1.07, p=0.005) and beta-blocker (HR 0.52, CI 0.34-0.94, p=0.014) were associated sudden mortality. In Chagas disease, heart failure is the main mode of death.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which plant cells defend against geminiviruses, a type of plant virus. The mechanism involves a protein called NIK, which interacts with a ribosomal protein called rp10. NIK phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) rp10, redirecting it to the nucleus where it may modulate viral infection. Overexpression of NIK or a hyperactive NIK mutant promotes accumulation of phosphorylated rp10 in nuclei, while an inactive NIK mutant fails to redirect rp10 to nuclei. Loss of rp10 function enhances susceptibility to gemivirus, similar to NIK null alleles. Geminivirus interferes with NIK-mediated localization of rp10 as a countermeasure. NIK signaling does not activate RNA silencing or hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth. Although gemivirus overcomes this defense, NIK response may restrict host range of other viruses.
Researchers investigated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which causes disease in humans by adapting to oxidative stress imposed by immune cells. They generated a stable strain with 70% reduced AO gene expression and evaluated its interaction with IF-γ-activated macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. Interaction with macrophages induced higher AO expression in conidia than yeast cells, while AO-RNA conidia and cells had decreased viability. In a mouse model, absence of AO in P. brasiliensis resulted in reduced fungal burden at 8 and 24 post-challenge and increased survival. In presence of H2, AO-exposed yeast increased expression presented higher viability than AO-RNA cells. Data support AO's role in defense against oxidative stress and virulence of P. brasiliensis. The study also explored AO's involvement in oxidative response to host macrophages and exogenous H2, and in a mouse infection model. Fungal cells exposed to H2 showed increased AO expression and higher viability than AO-RNA cells. Results implicate AO in resistance to oxidative burst by macrophages and agree with previous reports indicating AOX required for pathogenicity. Fungal burden in mice with AO-RNA conidia were lower at all periods, suggesting AO important for infection establishment, especially initial phase when cells face morphological shift to yeast while interacting with immune cells inducing oxidative response.
Researchers investigated whether memories are stored as attractors in populations of place cells in the hippocampus, specifically in the CA3 region, by morphing one context into another and observing responses of CA cell ensembles. Contrary to expectations, average activity in CA3 transitioned gradually rather than abruptly from one context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractors associated with stored representations. However, individual CA cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the sequence and displayed hysteresis, a signature of attract dynamics. To reconcile these results with attractor theory, a neural model of CA with attractors for both position and context was developed. Memories stored in overlapping ensembles within a spatial map resulted in position-dependent attractors transitioning at different points, smooth curves from averaging across population, while heterogeneous responses observed on single level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt transitions on both population and single levels, experimentally observed when remapping between independent maps. Strong feedback entailed hysteretic effect diminishing with overlap in memories. Results suggest context-dependent memory supported by local attractors within CA place cells.
Entamoeba histoly, a microaerobic enteric protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. Troozoites of E. histoly are exposed to various reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. Since E. hist lacks key components of eukaryotic anti-oxidative systems, alternative strategies have been postulated to operate in E. hist. This study investigated metabolic responses of E. hist to H2O2 and paraquat oxidative stress by measuring metabolites by capillary electrophores and time-of-flight spectrometry. Oxidative stress drastically modulated metabolites in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide amino metabolism. Stress inhibited glycol as a result of inactivation of several enzymes, redirecting flux towards glycer production, chitin biosynthesis, and nonoxidative branch of pentose pathway. Repression of glycol evidenced by accumulation of glycol intermediates upstream pyruv, reduced nucleos triosphates. Presence of glycer biosynthetic pathway in E hist demonstrated by glyol 3-phosphate glyol production upon stress. Proposed significance of gly biosynthetic as anti-oxid system in E hist.
IKAR is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its expression pattern is required for proper hematopoies. It collaborates with the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (Nu) complex to repress and activate gene expression. However, it remains unclear how IKAR can support activation while associated with the HD-containing Nu complex. IKAR binds the positive transcription elongation factor (PTEb) at promoters. This study demonstrates that Nu and Pb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited by IKAR to specific genes. IKAR expression influences recruitment of the Nu-Pb complex to gene regions and facilitates transcription by transferring phosphatase 1 (PPα), an IKAR-binding and Pb activator, to CD9. An IKAR mutant unable to bind PPα cannot sustain expression and impedes normal differentiation of hematietic progenitors. Knockdown of the Nu subunit reveals occupancy of Nu at transcribed regions favors relief of II promoter pausing and promotes elongation. The interaction of IKAR with Nu-Pb complex depends on IKAR levels, with low levels sufficient for Mi/Nu recruitment, but higher IKAR required for Nu-Pb and PPα to chromatin, CD9-Pb activation, and elongation. IKAR-PPα interaction is required for normal hematiet differentiation of primary cells. IKAR is the DNA subunit of the Nu-P multifunctional complex, containing chromatin remodeling Nu and transcription elongation Pb activities. IKAR is important for CD9 and Mi interaction and recruitment to actively transcribed genes in hematiet cells. IK interacts with PP and is dephosphorylated by this phosphat.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary history and phylogeography of rabies viruses associated with outbreaks in Trinidad, a Caribbean island experiencing periodic outbreaks in livestock. Molecular characterization of Trinidadian rabies virus (RV) and a Bayesian phyloge approach were used to determine if outbreaks resulted from in situ evolution or importation from the nearby South American mainland. RV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) related, falling into two temporally defined lineages, Trinidad I and II. Trinidad I included sequences from 1997-200, mostly from the northeast, closely related to RV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela. Trinidad II comprised southwest sequences, clustering into two groups, IIa and IIb, related to Brazil and Uruguay sequences. Phyloge analyses supported separate RV introductions from the mainland for each lineage, with estimated introduction and expansion dates suggesting in situ evolution within Trinidad following introduction. Co-circulation of lineages I and IIa in 200 was also indicated. Given the vampire bat origin of Trinidad RV, studies should investigate RV spatiemporal dynamics and bat ecology, particularly movement between mainland and Trinidad.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand the regulatory network of genes involved in the development of distinct areas in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The model uses Boolean logic to represent the interactions between five key genes: F8, Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp, and their proteins. The model simulates all possible networks containing these genes and identifies those that reproduce experimentally observed expression patterns. Results show that only certain networks with specific interactions and combinations, including auto-regulation and inductive loops, can reproduce the observed patterns. Analysis of the probability of each interaction suggests that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct functioning. The model illuminates the design of the gene network regulating cortical development and makes predictions for experimental testing.

The model examines the dynamics of all possible networks created by the five genes and proteins in anterior-posterior patterning of cortical areas. The induction of F8 by Sp is fixed in the simulated networks, as it has been demonstrated experimentally. Genes are also fixed to induce their corresponding proteins. Experimental data on expression levels at different locations would provide constraints for future models. The model reveals logical principles of genetic regulation of arealisation and guides future experiments.

The network regulating cortical development has multiple pathways, making it difficult to understand intuitively. A Boolean model simulates different networks and identifies structural requirements for good performance. Analysis suggests roles for the genes in the network. F8 expression at the anterior pole may drive correct patterning of transcription factors if simple interactions exist. This is an example of a signal converted into durable change in the brain.
Researchers used ChIP-Seq technology to study the genome-wide localization of Bmi-dependent H2A ubiquity in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. They found that B1-dependent H2 ubiquity is enriched at gene promoters, particularly at the transcription start site (TSS) of annotated genes, and is associated with the H3K27me3 mark and low-expressed genes in WT MEF cells. Additionally, they identified regions of H2 enrichment throughout the genome, almost 700 gene promoters with peaks of H2 exhibit lower expression compared to those without peaks of H2. Furthermore, genes with H2 peaks have increased expression upon B1 knockout. The study suggests that DNA methylation may be upstream of B1-dependent H2 ubiquity and that H2 targeting in differentiated cells employs a different mechanism than in embryonic stem cells.
Pregnancy-induced non-coding RNA (PINC) and retinoblast-associated protein 46 (b46) are upregulated in alve cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in alve cells that remain in the regressed gland following involution. The cells that survive involution are thought to function as alve progenitor cells that differentiate into milk-producing cells in subsequent pregnancies, but it is unknown whether INC and b46 are involved in maintaining this progenitor population. This study shows that in post-pubal mouse mammary, INC is enriched in luminal and alve progenitors, and INC levels increase throughout pregnancy then decline in lactation when alve cells undergo terminal differentiation. INC expression is decreased when HC11 mammary epithelial cells are induced to differentiate and produce milk. Overexpression of INC in HC11 blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of INC enhances differentiation. INC interacts with b46, as well as other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PC2), and targets of INC are differentially expressed following modulation of INC levels. Data suggest INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alve cells during pregnancy to prevent milk production until parturition. The PC complex including INC and b46 may confer epigen modifications maintaining a population of mammary epithelial committed to alve fate in involuted gland.
Researchers have investigated the role of PML/TRIM19, a protein involved in antiviral defense, in the context of HIV-1 infection. They found that HIV-1 triggers the formation of P cytoplasmic bodies within 30 minutes of infection, with a peak at 2 hours post-infection. P localization is blocked by reverse transcription inhibitors and not observed with unrelated viruses, suggesting it's specifically triggered by retroiral reverse transcription. P knockdown significantly increases reverse transcription efficiency, indicating it interferes with an early step of retroiral infection. P does not directly inhibit retroiral but acts through its partner Dax. In the presence of P, cytoplasmic Dax is near HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse transcription. Dax also inhibits exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, identifying it as a broad inhibitor of reverse transcription. The study unravels a novel antiral function for P and P nuclear-associated Dax. HIV-1 triggers rapid P re-localization to cytoplasm, correlated with decreased transduction, suggesting interference with early replication. Other retroviruses also trigger P cytoplasm localization and increased transduction in absence of P. Rather than P, Dax is the protein conferring resistance to retroiral. Dax colocalizes with HIV-1 p24 in cytoplasm, and knockdown enhances transduction, while overexpression inhibits in HeLa and PBMCs. P isoform PMLb confers resistance to HSV-1 by sequestering ICP. P knockdown enhances HIV-1, EV, MoML, and SIV infection.
Researchers have proposed a new approach to protein multiple structure alignment, called Matt (Multiple Alignments with Translations and Twists), which improves upon existing methods by incorporating flexibility into the alignment process. Traditional methods, such as fragment chaining, align short structural fragments optimally and then assemble them geometrically. Matt, however, allows for temporary translations and rotations between fragments to bring them closer together, even if impossible under rigid transformations. A dynamic programming step ensures geometric consistency in the final alignment. Tested on the Homstr and Smark datasets, Matt performs competitively with other programs on Homstr, but outperforms on Smark, which contains more distant homologous proteins. Matt excels in aligning α-helices and β-strands, crucial for structural library construction. A p-value based on core length and RMSD separates homologous from non-homologous proteins in Smark. Matt's success is attributed to modeling conformation states and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins.
Researchers investigated the regulation of Greatwall (Gwl) and its substrates Ensa/AR19 and Cdk during mitotic exit. They found that PP2/B is required for G dephosphorylation at the Cdk site Thr194 and En/AR19 deosphorylation is mediated by the phosphatase F1. However, inhibition or depletion of F1 or PP2 did not block deosphory of bulk mitotic Cdk substrates during exit. The study suggests a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Gwl, En/AR19 and C deosphorylation during mitotic exit. Mathematical modeling and experiments showed that mutual antagonism between G and PP/B accelerates both mitotic entry and exit. Data indicate that PP is responsible for inactivating G, while other phosphatases regulate additional phosphorylation sites contributing to G inactivation. The network of phosphases counteracting G, En/19 and C phosphorylation during exit remains to be determined.
Researchers studied how HIV-1, a subtype C, escapes neutralizing antibodies (Nab) in early stages of infection. Neutralizing antibodies are crucial for limiting virus replication and preventing new infections. They found that escape occurred despite high titers of autologous Nabs in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection. To understand escape pathways, they created envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants from resistant variants at multiple time points. In one subject, escape was driven by changes in region gp120 from V3 to V5. However, in another, escape required cooperation between V2 and gp41 ectodomain. The second subject's escape was driven by V2, which was retained over time and allowed virus to escape two monoclonal antibodies. Sequence analysis showed selective pressure on same Env regions, but different domains drove escape. This suggests multiple strategies, including glycan shifts, epitope alteration, and conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.
Researchers investigated the extent of positive and negative selection across the genome of Capsella grandiflora, a plant species in the Brassicaceae family. They sequenced the genomes of 13 individuals and found that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most non-coding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs. However, estimates of selection on noncoding regions across the Brassicaceae family showed strong signals of selection. Additionally, they observed reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Using expression data from leaf tissue, they found that highly expressed genes experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, they observed positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but results suggest both positive and negative selection on noncoding are rarer in plants compared to animals.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transforms resting B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts to establish latent infections that can give rise to malignancies. EB-encoded transcriptional regulator EB2 (EB2) drives the cooperative and combinatorial genome binding of master regulators of B-cell fate, RBPκ and E1. Contrary to previous studies, EB2 induces formation of new binding sites for RBPκ and E1, many of which are in close proximity to the cellular and viral genome. These induced sites co-occupied by EB2-RBPκ E1 correlate with transcriptional activation of genes important for Blymphoblast function. Conditional or repression of EB2 leads to rapid alteration in RBPκ and E1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at cooccupied sites. EB2 facilitates combinator interactions to induce new patterns of transcription occupancy and gene programming necessary for Blymphob growth and survival.

EBV type latency promotes B marginal developmental program, increasing RBPκ sites. EB-encoded coactivator EB2 reprograms chromosome patterns of host regulatory factors Rκ and E1. EB2 localizes with E1 and Rκ at enhancer and super-enhancer regions EB positive lymphoid cell lines.

Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of four deng virus (DENV) serotypes, exhibits genetic and vector competence differences among populations in Mexico. Studies have shown that the intersection of the Neovolcan axis (N) with the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypt populations north and south of N. Populations north and south of N differ in vector competence (VC) for deng serotype 2 (DENV2), with an average VC rate of 0.55 for mosquitoes from north of N and 0.20 for those from south of N. Most variation is attributed to midgut infection barriers, with 21.5% of Ae.egypt north of N failing to develop midut infections and 30.3% of those infected failing to disseminate, compared to 45.2% failing to develop midut and 62.8% failing to disseminate south of N. Barriers to gene flow in vector populations may impact epidemiologically relevant traits such as competence. Further studies are warranted to determine N's role as a barrier and whether differences in competence north and south are epidemiologically significant. Ae.egpt collected for genetic studies were phenotyped for DENV2, revealing variation in competence in Mexico, with southern Verac Coastal populations differing significantly from Merida, Chum, Cancun, and Yuc being most competent and Nuevoared and Houston least.
Researchers investigated the role of the Dna protein in the replication cycle of Escherichia coli. The protein cycles between an active ATP-bound and inactive ADP-bound form, and its accumulation is thought to control initiation frequency. Cells with a surplus of ATP-Dna showed no changes in replication timing, indicating that Dna is not the limiting factor for initiation. The study suggests that Dna drives the process, but other factors determine timing in response to the cell's environment. Dna-dependent Dna inactivation (DA) and Dna-binding protein Dia were also investigated. Loss of DA affected the cycle during slow growth and made cells sensitive to Dia protein, indicating compromised machinery performs less robustly. The study proposes that E. coli has a robust cycle driven by Dna levels, initiation occurs with sufficient ATP-Dna, and timing is governed by cell environment. Cells with surplus ATPna showed no shift in initiation timing, indicating Dna is not the limiting factor for precise timing. Several mechanisms ensure initiation does not occur, but less is known about timing. The frequency must match growth, otherwise DNA concentration altered. The result indicates cells with surplus ATPna, timing controlled same as wild type, and controller not amount-Dna.
Researchers introduced a novel approach called partial Granger causality to uncover interactions in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency domain. This method was tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including gene array data from HeLa cell cycle, in vivo-electrode array field potentials from sheep's inferotemporal cortex, and in vivo potentials from macaque monkey's hemisphere. The study aimed to demonstrate that ad hoc definitions of causality, such as PDC, can be misleading, yielding contradicting results between time and frequency domain Grangerality. Due to HeLa microarray's sampling rate limitation, dynamical activity at minute scale could not be assessed. LFP data from monkey performing GO/NOO task showed oscillatory activity in beta (14-30 Hz) range in sensorotor cortex during prestimulus. Pairwise Granger analysis depicted connectivity in Figure 5, but partialanger in time (Figure 4C) and frequency (Figure 4E) revealed complete relationship. A toy model with exogenous and latent variables was used to illustrate frequency decomposition of partialanger. Five time series were defined by equations, where εi(t) were uncorrelated, ε6 was exogenous, and ε7(t-1 + ε(t-2) represented latent influence. The definition of partialanger has a transparent statistical meaning, depending on well-understood conditional variance.
Researchers have developed new methods for inferring local ancestry in individuals with mixed ancestry, such as Latinos, using genome sequencing data. Current methods for local ancestry inference are often designed for genotyping arrays and do not utilize the full spectrum of data from sequencing. Haplotype-based approaches are computationally demanding and time-consuming for large sample sizes. The new methods leverage continent-specific variants (CSV) to improve performance in sequenced genomes. A key feature is incorporating admixed genomes with public datasets like 100 Genomes to improve CSV calling. Simulations show the approach attains accuracy to computationally intensive haplotype approaches with decreased runtime. The method recovers local ancestries as 100 Gen consensus calls in admixed individuals from  Gen Project. The approach is extended to low-coverage sequencing, showing accurate ancestry can be attained at low coverage. CSV is generalized to sub-continental-specific variants (s) and can determine sub-ancestry for chromosomal segments based on s. 

The study presents an approach for local ancestry in sequenced admixed individuals using continent-specific variants (CSV). CSV density is high across the genome for fast and accurate inference. A study of 15,000 African Americans and 30,000 African recombination are examples. Sequencing catalogues larger variants, many being continent-specific. The concept is extended to sub-population variants (s) for ancestry assignment admixed from same continent. As sequencing costs decrease, computational accuracy becomes critical for local inference. The approach iteratively re-estimates CSV from inferred regions in admixed samples, first using external haplotype panels, then local ancestry, and re-CSV using confidently called segments. The variants are modeled within hidden Markov models to achieve efficient local inference (LancCSV). The model accounts for low-sequencing errors and finite reference panels.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify circadian oscillation in gene expression in mammals by applying digital signal processing algorithms to gene profiles. Traditional statistical analysis of periodicity is limited by small dataset size and noise, but this approach identifies circadian oscillation in almost 100% of expressed genes. The method involves converting single gene profiles into a continuous stream to reduce noise and enhance signal, then applying digital processing to identify patterns. This suggests oscillation is a natural feature of nearly all biological pathways, with genes displaying daily variation affecting the system as a whole. However, previous methods only considered one gene at a time, lacking power to identify circadian in more than a small percentage of genes. The new approach combines statistical tests for periodicity with digital processing to reveal circadian baseline in almost all genes. Changes in gene expression due to mutations or environmental factors should be considered in context of amplitude and phase changes of oscillations. The method was applied to murine liver data, identifying circadian deteriorating point at p=0.05 confidence level. Results show amplitude of core circadian genes does not differ significantly among tissues, and perturbations in oscillating systems depend on circadian time and wave properties of pathways.
Researchers used whole-genome resequencing to study recombination in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers (Ficed albicollis) to map crossover and non-crossover events with high resolution. They identified 325 crossovers at a median of 1.4 kb, with 86% localized to <10 kb, and 267 non-crosso events. Crossover rates were higher in males (3.56/Mb) than females (2.28/M) and increased towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossovers were non-randomly distributed, with hotspots in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG islands. Non-crosso locations were associated with crosso. A significant bias (0.18) favored 'G' over 'A' alleles at non-c events, indicating GC-bi conversion in avian system. This approach can be applied to other species, providing a comprehensive recombination landscape.
Researchers have studied the folding properties of repeat-proteins, which consist of repeated 20-40 amino acid stretches that fold into non-globular, elongated structures stabilized by interactions within and between repeats, but lack contacts between distant residues. They analyzed the folding landscape as a quasi-one dimensional problem due to inherent symmetries in sequence and 3D structure. A general description of repeat-protein energy was developed using an Ising-like treatment of elementary interactions between foldons, treated as spin variables. The overall properties of a complete domain (stability and cooperativity) can be derived from this description. The one-dimensional model implies simple relations for observables: free energy (ΔG) and cooperativity (m-value), not applicable to globular proteins. Parameters for coarse-grained description in foldon variables were extracted from detailed simulations on funneled landscapes. A case study of tetratricptide (PR) repeat proteins was presented, relating results to experimentally observed transitions. Single mutations significantly affected folding behavior, suggesting natural proteins are poised at particular ratios of inter/intra-element energetics, allowing transitions in physiological conditions, related to biological functions.
Researchers have investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer associated with viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. They found that CHOP is overexpressed in human and mouse models of HCC, and that CH-null mice are resistant to chemical-induced liver damage and fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Gene expression profiling showed that CH deletion reduces basal inflammatory signaling in the liver. The study suggests that CH contributes to HCC by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation, implicating CH as a common factor in H development in various liver diseases. CH is associated with liver injury and upstream of fibrosis, and its expression in CH-null mice differs from wild-type in a way that accounts for greater susceptibility to fib and oncogenesis. CH is placed upstream of fib and tumorigenesis, as CH-null animals are partially protected from both. The progression from CH to liver tumors occurs in a stepwise fashion, consistent with H etiology. Understanding CH mechanisms, direct and indirect, will have implications for other cancers beyond H. The study reveals an unexpected link between H and stimuli that predispose to it, suggesting points for therapeutic intervention. CH expression characterizes H tumors and impacts inflammatory expression and fib relevant to H.
A systematic review of clinical studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethopica in Ethiopia was conducted to identify potentially effective medications for clinical trials. 24 records reporting 506 treatment episodes of CL due to Lethopica were identified, with antimonials (201), pentam (150), and cryotherapy (103) being the most commonly used. However, only two small, poor-quality randomized trials and two non-randomized studies on cryotherapy, antimonials, and pentam were found. Cryotherapy showed 60-80% and 69-85 cure rates, while pentam was effective against complicated and non-responsive CL cases. All studies had methodological limitations. Data on milfosine, paromycin, and liposomal amphotin B were scarce, with few on DCL. Antimonials with parom or pent combination seemed effective, but not evaluated. The evidence for CL treatment of Lethica is limited, with antimonials the most available, but efficacy and safety in CL should be defined. Alternative treatments like milfos or paromycin should be explored. High-quality trials on Leth are needed to evaluate options in parallel.
Researchers have reconstituted a biochemical oscillator in vitro with three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, that displays salient properties of circadian rhythms, including self-sustained 24-hour periodicity and temperature compensation. They analyzed the biochemical basis of this oscillator by quantifying time-dependent interactions among the proteins using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis to elucidate the timing of complex formation among the proteins. Data were used to derive a dynamic model that accurately reproduces rhythms of Kai complexes and KaiC phosphorylation and is consistent with biophysical observations of individual protein interactions. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) confirmed monomer exchange among Kai hexamers. The model demonstrates function of monomer exchange may maintain synchrony among Kai hexers in reaction, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. Perturbations of in vitro oscillator using temperature pulses reset phase of Kai oscillator, testing resetting characteristics unique circadian.
Researchers investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial variability in brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual detection task using electrocorticography (EG). They found an inverted-U relationship between trial-trial brain activity and performance, where higher variability in broadband EG activity near the trial mean was associated with higher hit rates and faster reaction times. This relationship was observed in both post-stimulus-evoked and pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory dynamics. The findings support the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and attractor network theories, which propose the brain settles into a confined state under performance and proximity to the target is associated with better performance. Variability can be decoupled from trial-averaged activity and correlated with behavior, predicting a U or inverted relationship between trial-trial brain and performance. The study provides evidence for this phenomenon in human brain using EG recordings from patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment.
Researchers studied the mating-type loci (MAT) in 24 species of the Trichporales, a group of fungi closely related to the pathogenic Cryptococcus. They found that the MAT loci are fused into a single gene in each mating type, similar to the pathogenic Cryptoccus, but with different HD and P allele combinations. This suggests that the fusion of MAT loci occurred independently in Trichporales and pathogenic Cryptoccus, supporting the hypothesis of convergent evolution towards fused regions. Unlike other fungi, the content and order of genes within the fused loci are conserved in Trichporales, and there is no suppression of recombination extending to adjacent chromosomal regions. This indicates different mechanisms for evolution of linked MAT loci in these groups. The ancestral state of basidiomycetes is considered tetrapolar, with two unlinked MAT loci controlling mating at the haploid stage, but some species have bipolar systems through linkage of HD and P loci or loss of P locus function. Fungi are models for studying evolution of genomic regions involved in mating and type determination.
Chagas disease is the most important vector-borne disease in Latin America, with residual insecticide-based initiatives controlling domiciliated vectors in many regions. However, nonomiciliated vectors remain responsible for significant transmission and control is now a key challenge. A mathematical model was developed to predict temporal variations in abundance of nonomic vectors inside houses. Demographic parameters were estimated by fitting the model to two years of field data from Yuc peninsula, Mexico. The model accurately predicted field data in absence and presence of insecticide. Pyreth spraying was effective at 50mg2 applied yearly within two-month matching immigration season, achieving >80% reduction in abundance. Larger doses or more frequent interventions decreased efficacy, while different timing and lower frequencies drastically reduced. Insect screens reduced abundance proportionally to immigration rate. Control nonomic vectors by insecticide requires yearly application and understanding immigration pattern. Screens offer an effective, sustainable alternative for integrated control of neglected vectororne diseases.
Feather patterning in avian skin relies on a coordinated interaction between fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, along with mesenchymal cell movement, in a reaction-diffusionaxis system. This system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration through a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, compressing the epidermis to intensify F20 expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of ectodysplasin (E), which initiates F20 expression. The E wave spreads across mesenchym cell gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchym cells to begin feather bud formation. These waves and precise arrangement of primordia are lost in flightless emu and ostrich, though via different developmental routes. The ostr retains arrangement of birds in general but lays primia without wave, akin to hair follicle formation in mammalian embryos. Embryonic em lacks cells to enact formation, causing failure, instead entire skin gains primia through later process. This shows reaction-diffaxis system, integrated with mechanical, generates feather array in flight birds. Key role EDA/Ectysasin receptor (EDAR) pathway in vertebrate patterning has been reactivated in quasi-1 manner, imposing highly ordered formation.

Feather patterning system relies on epithelial FGF to attract mesenchym cells form aggregate, absence F20 in scale mutant leads failure primium formation, demonstrating epider role in avian patterning. High-density dependence feather likely rests rapid mesenchal condensation stabil F20 than distinct cell phenotypes. Skin chicken, duck, ostr, and em embryos have pronounced differences arrangements. F20 elevated contracted tissue, supporting aggregation activation F production. Other genes analysed (AX2, BMP,4, E, ED) not alter conditions. Results operate reaction-diff system patter.
A systematic review of 33 studies on the presence of Ebola and Marburg virus in body fluids of infected patients and survivors was conducted. The aim was to determine the likelihood of active virus presence in human fluids (viral RNA). Eligible infections included Marburg virus (MARV) and Zaire, Sudan, Ta Forest, and Bundibuyo species of Ebola. Studies were screened for laboratory confirmation of infection through tissue culture or RT-PCR tests, or clinical history with subsequent filirus antibodies or inflammatory factors. 683 articles were found, with 33 eligible. Most fluid types had insufficient data to draw conclusions, with variable positivity prevalence. Fluids taken >16 days after onset were usually negative. RT-PCR tests for filirus RNA gave positive results 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filirus was reported in most fluid types, but not every sample from confirmed patient. Apart from semen, non-blood RT-PCR samples likely negative and possibly low risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids major transmission risk due to high viral loads in blood.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model, called the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, to describe the timing of neuronal spikes in the brain. This model takes into account the power-law behavior of the membrane voltage, which cannot be characterized by a single time constant, due to correlated conductance processes. The emergent effect of these correlations is a non-Markian process, modeled with a fractional derivative. A fractional derivative is a non-local process where the value is determined by integrating a weighted voltage trace, or memory. The model varies the exponent of the derivative from 0 to 1, with 1 representing a normal derivative. As the exponent decreases, the weights of the voltage increase, making the value correlated with the past voltage trajectory. The model reproduces upward and downward spike adaptations in cortical pyramidal and tectal neurons in vitro. It also produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and interpike variability with power-law distribution. The model analyzes adaptation and responses to noisy oscillatory input, generating reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input. The spiking activity of the fractional model deviates from Markov model, reflecting accumulated membrane dynamics affecting response to external stimulation.
Researchers identified six superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in the genome of Paracidioides, a genus of pathogenic fungi. These enzymes counteract reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host immune cells, allowing the fungus to survive. The study analyzed gene expression of SODs in different stages of Paracoides life cycle, including yeast, mycelia, and conidia, as well as under oxidative stress and phagocytic cell interaction. Results showed increased expression of PbSOD1 and PbOD3 during transition, exposure to oxidative agents and phagocytic cells, suggesting these proteins combat superoxide radicals during host-pathogen interaction. Knockdown of PbOD1 and Pb3 showed involvement in response to host effector cells, particularly oxidative stress, in mouse infection model. Protein analysis and knockdown strains suggest Pb3 linked to extracellular activity while Pb1 to intracellular. Data indicate Paracoid responds to endogenous radicals and oxidative burst by inducing SOD isoforms.
Researchers investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaper binding in various species, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa. They analyzed high-throughput interaction data and found that predicted disorder by the IUP algorithm negatively correlates with chaper binding, indicating that IDPs tend to avoid chaper. This effect is observed across prokary, unicellular eukary, and metaz species. The presence of ordered domains, such as Pfam, may contribute to this effect. Chaper binding to disordered proteins is often accompanied by binding to other proteins, suggesting that ID use chaper for assembly with partners rather than folding. In all three taxonomic groups, non-chone-binding proteins have higher disorder than chone-binding proteins. Predicted disorder does not distinguish between proteins with or without glob domains, so the authors selected chone binding of proteins with at least one glob domain. ID that bind chone are more likely to bind other proteins than ordered ones. There is overlap between chone and nonone-binding proteins, so the authors compared disorder of those that only bindone and those that bindone and other proteins. Results show a difference in disorder between the two groups.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the Spalt (Salm) and Spalt-related (Sal) zinc finger transcription factors are regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway in the wing imaginal disc. These genes are required for cell survival and proliferation in the central region of the disc and vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand the genetic control of growth and patterning by Dpp, identifying direct Salm and Sal target genes and analyzing their functions is crucial. Candidate Salm/Sr targets were identified by comparing sal/sr knockdown wing discs with control discs in microarray experiments and in situ hybridization of genes whose mRNA levels varied, revealing a complex transcription landscape regulated by Sp in the disc. Targets include genes with expression turned off and on by Salm/Sr, and loss-of-function analysis indicates a fraction requirement for growth and pattering. This opens a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing, linking Dpp activity to epithelial tissue development.
Researchers have identified two protein phosphatases, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators I-2Y-2 and SDS-22, as key regulators of ZYG-1 levels in Caenorhabditis elegans. ZYG-1 is a homolog of the human Plk4 protein, which is required for centri duplication. The study found that downregulation of PP activity either directly or mutation of I-2Y-2 or SDS-22 rescues the loss of centri duplication associated with a zyg- hypomorphic allele. This is achieved through an increase in Z-1 levels, indicating PP regulates Z- through post-translational mechanism. Moderate inhibition of PP activity restores centri duplication in z- mutant, but strong inhibition in wild-type leads to centri amplification via production of more than one centri. The study defines a new pathway limiting number of daughter centri produced each cycle. PP activity is a critical regulator of Z- levels and centri duplication, previously implicated in regulation of centrosome separation at mitosis.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in the municipality of Campinas, southeastern Brazil, to investigate the transmission of visceral leishmanias (VL) in an environmentally protected area (EPA). The study aimed to determine the presence of Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalence of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six species, confirmed or suspected vectors or transmitters of Leish, were identified, including the main L. (L) infant vector in Brazil, Lutzia longipal, captured in the EPA. Natural infection by L. (L) infant was recorded in one Expillatia firm specimen and Pintia montola. Infection by L. (L) infant and Leish subgenus Viia was detected in white-eared opossum (Didel albivent), a known reservoir of VL. Geographical coordinates of each sampling infected animals plotted on a map of the EPA demonstrated proximity between animals, human residences, including dogs positive VL, and forest areas. The EPA has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease foci in similar scenarios, i.e., wild areas undergoing modifications, is evident. Different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included in prevention and control measures considering the particularities of each area.
Epstein-Barr virus (EB)-encoded microRNA miR-B9 promotes tumor metastasis by targeting E-cadherin in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MicroRNAs (mi) are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and play critical roles in cellular processes. EB, an oncogenic virus, is associated with nasaryngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic tumor in Asia. Previous studies found viral proteins promote migration and invasiveness, but not all tissues express these oncoproteins, suggesting other mechanisms contribute to tumor behavior. Our sequencing revealed high mi-B9 in EB-positive tissues. We investigated mi-B9 in EB-negative and EB-positive cells using gain and loss-of-function approaches. mi9 promotes migration and invas in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Computational analysis revealed mi9 targets Eadher, pivotal in cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical and functional analysis confirmed mi9 inhibits Ead to induce mesenchymal phenotype and promotes migration. Results indicate mi9 a promastatic viralRNA and high levels in EB-positive cells contribute to aggressiveness.

The abundance of mi9 coupled with downmodulation cellular mi-200 in EB tumors drives epithelial to mesenchal with enhanced motility and metastasis. mi9 and mi-200 share sequence, critical for interaction. Studies shown mi-200 significantly downmodulated in tumors. We demonstrated EB-encoded mi9 highly in tissues mi9 directly targets Ead to mesenchal and migratory in cells. Sequencing revealed mi9 most abundantly expressed EB in tumors. Taq-based PCR confirmed majority tissues mi9 higher than oncogenic mi21. Depletion mi9 increased luciferase activities indicated suppression mi9 activities 50-70 with treatment lentiviral-mi9 expressing cells. Ectopic mi9 physiological promotes migration capability EB-negative cells confirmed mi9 promatory viral. Unlike LMP and L proteins, transcripts consistently detected all cases indicate mi9 significant contributor migr and invasive EB-infected cells.
Researchers have developed a command-line tool called gashimi for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. Given a genomic region, gash creates sash plots for individual RNA-seq experiments and aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software. Unlike existing tools, gash uses bioinformatics formats, is annotation-independent, and visualizes splicing for large regions by scaling genomic segments between splice sites. gash is available on GitHub and implemented in Python, generating R code for plotting.

A tool for drawing sash plots was initially part of the MISO software, quantifying alternative splicing from RNAq experiments. Current implementations include a standalone utility for sash plots for M-index splicing and built-in IGV. Visualization of RNAq data is crucial for exploratory analysis, but splicing visualization is not integrated in common browsers or standalone software and is annotation-dependent. Visualizing splicing is challenging as events occur between regions, not contiguous on the genome, distant tens or hundreds of kilobases.

For comparison, the genomic region containing splicing was represented using gash and sash in IGV. gash aggregated samples through the same group and shrunk intron lengths, enhancing visualization. The sash representation splicing is a standard, but current implementations have limitations narrowing its application. gash solves many issues, eliminating specialized formats and supporting hundreds of samples.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across species, addressing limitations of existing sequence alignment methods for conserved non-coding sequences. The model captures evolution of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and background sequences, including gains and losses of TFBS, a crucial for regulatory evolution. A computational framework uses this model to solve CRM alignment and prediction problems, improving over existing methods. The approach is similar to statistical alignment but uses conserved sites to improve alignment and deals with uncertainties of binding annotations and sequence in a probabilistic framework. Simulated and real data demonstrate the method's superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Alignments were used to study genome-wide binding of transcription factors in Drosophila blastoderm, revealing: (i) factor-bound sequences are under evolutionary constraints even if neighboring genes are not expressed, and (ii) distal sites are more conserved than proximal. The approach is implemented as software EM (Evolutionary Model cis-regulatory Module) for broad application.
Research on the Drosophila piRNA pathway has revealed distinct functions in genome maintenance and telomere protection. The piRNA pathway silences transposons in the germline, but its role during development was unclear. Mutations in genes arm, aub, ago3, and rhi led to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during cleavage stage embryonic divisions. a and arm showed defects in telere resolution during meiosis and cle divisions, while mutations lig-IV, which disrupts non-homous end joining, suppressed fusions. By contrast, lig-IV enhanced chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed a and arm mutations disrupted telere binding of HO, a component of the telere protection complex, and reduced expression of 19-22 telere-specific piRNAs. Mutations r and ago did not block HO binding or production of theseRNAs. These findings uncovered separable functions for the Dophila pi pathway. a, arm, r, and ago silenced transpos and maintained chromosome integrity during cle-stage embryonic divisions, while a and arm had additional function in assembly of the telere complex. a and arm were required for T recruitment, consistent with ligation of chromosome in mutant embryos. a and arm had function in telere protection not shared ago or r. Drosila chromosome breaks can be converted to stable teleres, terminal deletions with additional copies of teleric elements He-A and TART. Terminal deletions passed in heterozygous for a or pi gene showed increased T repeats.
Researchers have identified a new Ebola virus species, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, responsible for a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Uganda. The outbreak occurred in November 2007 in Bundibyo District, Western Uganda, with 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths reported. The new virus is distantly related to Côte'Ivo ebolavirus, found in western Africa, despite the large geographic distance between the two countries. Initial investigation used classic antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA, and a newly developed random-primed pyrosequencing approach to identify the virus. Evidence of Ebola infection was detected in eight specimens using a broadly reactive ebavirus capture assay and IgM assay. The Ugandan Ministry of Health was notified on November 28, 2007. Bundugyo ebavirus diverges significantly from previously recognized ebaviruses, suggesting antigenic and pathogenic differences. Current ebavirus vaccines, Zaire and Sudan, may not protect against this new virus. Cross-protection studies are needed to assess vaccine efficacy. Retrospective analysis of case, epidemiologic, and laboratory data from the Bundugyo outbreak show a lower fatality rate (36%) compared to Zaire (80-90%) and Sudan (50-55%). Studies in non-human primates are needed to compare pathogenicity. Antigen-capture, Ig, Ig, and real-time PCR assays were transferred to the Uganda Research Institute for rapid case identification and control. The outbreak continued through December 2007, resulting in 149 cases and 37 deaths.
Researchers analyzed a large dataset of 648 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with an average 4.78-year follow-up to quantify the heterogeneity in disease progression. The Global Deteration Scale (GDS) and Functional Staging (FAST) procedures characterize seven stages from normal to severe dementia, with published mean durations but unknown variances. Calculations for DS/FAST stages 4-6 revealed standard deviations comparable to mean durations, indicating large variations among patients. This heterogeneity is consistent with subgroups differing in decline patterns. A longitudinal analysis showed significant variation in DS/FAST 4-6 durations, with standard deviations similar to mean values, indicating cognitive and functional decline variability. The study suggests AD is a heterogeneous disease, supported by literature. Temporal variability in AD progression ranges from months to decades, with biological correlates investigated but underlying reasons uncertain. A combination of factors may contribute to variability. This study's finding large heterogeneity in DS/FAST durations aligns with reports, using a 23-year dataset representing stages 4-7 AD. The Functional Staging (FAST) procedure, based on DS, describes 16 stages from normal to severe AD, enumerated with some differences. A 5-year follow-up study associated severe frontal lobe involvement with rapid AD, and a 15-year study examined progression patterns.
Researchers have extended a model of adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus to include realistic spatially driven input patterns from grid cells in the entorinal cortex. They compared network performance across three adaptation strategies: conventional plasticity, turnover, and additive neurogenesis. Additive neurogenesis was found to be superior, allowing the network to adapt to changing input statistics while preserving earlier representations. A more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule incorporating cell death and plasticity of new granule cells outperformed individual strategies. This rule can be tailored for short or long-term memory. The model was also used to examine adult neurogenesis over an animal's lifetime under different rearing conditions, showing distinct profiles that could be tested experimentally. Place cells emerged in a realistic manner due to sparsification by the dentate gyrus layer. The model is based on rodent literature and provides a starting point for comparative analysis as more data becomes available. The hippocampal circuit was examined across environments with realistic input from grid cells, confirming additive neurogenesis superiority over conventional plasticity and turnover. A multidimensional Gaussian distributions modeled input patterns at the entorinal layer.
African trypanosomes express three identical cytosolic glutathione peroxidase (Px)-type enzymes, which detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides. Previous studies have shown that Trypanosoma brucei lacking mitochondrial PxIII exhibit a weak and transient proliferation defect, while parasites lacking cytosolic PxI and PxII undergo rapid lipid peroxidation and lysis. The phenotype can be rescued by supplementing with α-tocopherol derivative Trolox. This study reveals that the lysosome is the origin of cellular injury. Feeding PxII knockout parasites with Alexa-conjugated dextran or LysoTracker in presence of Tro yields discrete lysosomal staining. Upon withdrawal of antioxidant, the signal spreads over the whole cell and is lost. T. bruce acquires iron by endocytosis of transferrin. Supplementing medium with iron or transferrin induces, while iron chel deferox and apo transferrin attenuates lysis of PxII knockout cells. Immunofluorescence with MTracker and lysosomal marker p67 shows disintegration precedes mitochondrial damage. In vivo experiments confirm negligible mitochondrial peroxidase role: infected PxIII cells display slightly delayed development compared to wild-type. Data demonstrate lysosome, not mitochondrion, is primary site of damage in African trypanosomes. Cytosolic trypanione/tryparedin peroxides protect lysosome from iron-induced peroxidation. This is linked to high endytic and iron acquisition in infective stage T. bruce. Cytos PxII knockout in procyclic form is viable in Tro-free medium.
Researchers have investigated the role of the protein PMEL in melanosome formation and pigmentation in mice. PMEL is an amyloid protein found in melanocytes that forms fibrils within melanosomes where eumins are deposited later. It is conserved across vertebrates and variants in several species are associated with reduced eum in epidermal tissues. However, the effect of these variants is unclear and no complete loss-of-function has been reported in mammals. A mouse line was created with the Pmel gene inactivated (P−/−). These mice are viable, fertile, and display no developmental defects. Melanosomes in P−/− melanocytes are spherical, unlike the elongated shape in wild-type. This was observed in skin-derived melanocytes and retinal epithelium melanocytes. Inactivation of P has a mild effect on coat color in different backgrounds, most notable in brown/Tp mice. This is similar to the silver mutation, suggesting other alleles are dominant-negative. Despite mild effect on pigmentation, P− led to reduced eum in hair, showing PMEL's role in efficient epidermal pigmentation.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental methods for deng vector control. Nineteen studies were eligible, with sixteen contributing to the meta-analysis. The methods evaluated were: (a) container covers with insecticides, (b) waste management and clean-up campaigns, and (c) elimination of breeding sites by rendering mosquito breeding sites unusable. Quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste management without direct collection and elimination of breeding sites. Both review and meta showed a weak effect on larval populations, with no differences between individual results. Meta-analysis showed container without insecticides (BI: -7.9, DOE-5) and waste with garbage collection (BI: -8.83, DOE-6.2) achieved strongest reductions for BI, whereas P results were opposite with covers insect (P: -0.83, 0.09) and elimination (P: -0.95, -0.83). Each method showed effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities Aedes mosquitoes. However, high-quality studies are needed to strengthen evidence. A previous studies concluded environmental management was effective on vector indices, and a combination of community-based management and container covering water reduced deng risk. This study aimed to review and meta-analyze effectiveness of environmental methods. Searches were finished May 2017, but no further studies altered results or published. Both review and meta showed environmental interventions reduced lar and pupal densities Aedes.
Researchers have identified small molecules that selectively inhibit protein synthesis by stalling the ribosome, a potential strategy for therapeutic development of compounds. Compounds that inhibit PCSK9, a regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been shown to reduce LDL in preclinical models and affect translation of few off-target proteins. However, the impact on cell physiology and ribosome control pathways is unknown. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was used to identify proteins and pathways that modulate growth in presence of PCS9 translational inhibitor PF-06303 (PF3). The most potent genetic modifiers of fitness in presence PF3 were ubiquitin binding protein ASC2 and helicase ASC3, which bind to ribosome and protect from toxic effects of high concentrations. Surprisingly, translation control proteins Pelota (PE) and H1 sensitize cells to PF3 treatment. Genetic experiments showed ASC3 acts with ASC2 and downstream of H1. These results identify connections between ribosome control pathways and provide insights into selectivity of compounds that stall translation, aiding development of next-generation compounds to treat disease.
Researchers have discovered that the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSH) protein, SO, induces widespread destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) in host cells to evade immune detection and block gene expression. However, the mechanism of SO-induced mRNA turnover remained unknown, despite its lack of intrinsic ribonuclease activity. The study found that SO stimulates cellular RNA turnover through a novel mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation, where SO-expressing cells exhibit extended poly(A) polymerase-generated poly(A) tails and polyaden-linked mRNA turnover. Polyaden changes correlate with RNA function, and inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SO activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are critical cofactors for SO function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear localization by SO. SO-induced turnover represents a new mechanism of host shutoff and a model to probe poly(A)-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. The study reveals a link between polyadenylation and RNA surveillance, as yeast mutants defective in RNA processing accumulate hyperadenylated transcripts, and analogous pathways may function in higher eukaryotes. Polyadenated precursors to RNA have been detected in mammalian cells.
Researchers investigated the role of type III interferon (IFλ) in the immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in the lung. They found that IFλ is induced during bacterial infection and promotes inflammation by inhibiting microRNA-21 (miR21) regulation of PDC4, a protein that promotes inflammatory signaling. In mice lacking the IFλ receptor, IL-28, or PDC4 had improved clearance of airway pathogens and reduced pulmonary pathology with lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. IFλ and P4 are conserved elements in the response to airway pathogens with differential effects on innate immunity. The expression of IL-28, more abundant on epithelial cells than immune cells, may be important in specific cytokine responses to pathogens. Mice lacking IL-28 had increased miR21 levels and reduced inflammatory cytokines in the airway, while those with IL-28 reduced mi21 at 18 hours post-infection correlated with prolonged P4 expression. The study concludes that inhibiting IL-28 signaling reduces lung inflammation and improves bacterial clearance.
Researchers conducted a retrospective study on 781 cases of advanced-stage 2 human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) admitted to the National Center for African Trypanosomias in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1989 and 2012. The study aimed to investigate mortality trends and risk factors. Death was the outcome variable, and age, gender, duration of disease, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cytology, protach, clinical status, and treatment regimen were predictors in logistic models. Death rates were 17.2% in the meloprol schedule, 12.1 in short melrol, 5.4 in eflorine, 9.1 NECT, and 36% in severely affected patients given eorine. After adjusting for treatment, death odds ratios were 10.40 for clinical dysfunction on admission, 2.14 for protach, 1.99 for parasites in CSF, and 1.7 for cytach. Multivariate analysis retained clinical status and protach as predictors of death. An algorithm for clinical assessment used in the study may serve as basis for development of standardized tools for H management and epidemiological reports.
Researchers have developed a computer vision pipeline to study the effects of isolation on social dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for studying small-scale, temporary social behavior. The pipeline includes an improved tracking system to follow large groups of flies and an algorithm to quantify changes in social networks in response to isolation. The study found that isolation significantly enhances individual and local network parameters, depicting near-neighbor relationships. Genome-wide molecular correlates of behavioral changes showed gene expression alterations on day one, mostly in metabolic genes, verified by increased lipid content in isolated flies. A reliable tracking pipeline was established for large groups to unravel behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social dynamics in Drosila. 

The pipeline was applied to study effects of isolation on social dynamics, correlating changes with genome-wide expression. Results show strong effects on social dynamics, gene expression, and physiology. The toolset for social analysis includes molecular, genetic, individual, grouped, and behavioral analysis. Dophila melanaster is a model for studying behavior and its mechanisms. Behavioral and expression changes initiated early, while alterations lasting, gene levels transient. Data suggest after one day of isolation, flies alter physiology, promoting interactions with neighboring flies. Walking distance is an individual parameter changing persistently. The approach differs in classification strategy and dataset extraction. A previous study generated unweighted networks, concluding isolation had no effect on networks.
A clinical pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with 10-day post-discharge follow-up. A total of 841 patients were enrolled (325 pre-intervention, 516 intervention). During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for intravenous (IV) fluids decreased at both district and sub-district hospitals (p < 0.001) with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when IV fluids were prescribed, the volume adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the antibiotic azithromycin increased (p < 0.001; district p= 0.035 sub-district) with RR of 6.9 (district) and 1.6 (sub-d) while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased; zinc adherence increased. The study demonstrates that a smartphone tool can improve guideline adherence.
Researchers investigated the impact of temperature on host-parasite interactions using a mechanistic model of within-parasite dynamics in Daphnia magna and its microidian parasite Ordpora collata. The study aimed to integrate temperature dependencies of host and parasite traits, such as survival and virulence, into models of disease dynamics. A metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) was used to specify relationships between host mortality, parasite growth, virulence, and abundance. The model effectively predicted host survival, parasite growth, and infection cost across temperatures with fewer parameters than discrete models. Results demonstrated the potential of linking M-based models with mechanistic host-parite framework to predict temperature responses of parasite dynamics at the within-host level. 

The study analyzed data on host and parasite across a temperature gradient using an M-based model of within-parite population to capture thermal dependencies of aging and virulence. A mathematical model was fitted to experimental data on Daphnia and Ordpora to examine effects of temperature on traits, interactions, and dynamics. Nine temperatures spanned the range of D, quantifying lifespan for exposed and unexposed, and parasite abundance at death.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory neurons, specifically GABAergic interneurons, in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain. They found that three types of interneurons, parvalbum (PV), somostatin (SOM), and vaso intestinal (VIP), play a crucial role in controlling the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition onto PCs. PV interneurons primarily target the soma and basal dendrites of PCs, while SOMneurons target the apical dendrites and inhibit other interneurons. VIPneurons connect to SOMneurons, creating a disinhibitory circuit for distal dendrites of PCs. The researchers proposed a network motif consisting of SOM and VIP interneurons to control PV-mediated redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition. Using a computational model, they showed that the properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. They demonstrated that the SOM-VIP motif allows the circuit to switch between two processing modes, either integrating or cancelling top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs. The study suggests that this subnetwork optimizes control of different input streams and processing modes.
Microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) aim to link specific microbes to host phenotypes by comparing microbial abundances between two groups of samples. However, abundance differences reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. Researchers found that interactions can generate a large number of spurious associations providing no mechanistic insight. Using techniques from statistical physics, they developed a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The method corrected inflated p-values in association tests and showed only a small subset is directly linked to disease. Direct associations had higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate, and brain-gut axis as factors in inflammatory disease.

The study found that realistic interactions produce spurious associations between microbiome and phenotypes, many of which can be removed by a procedure based on maximum entropy models from statistical. This approach, dubbed Direct Analysis (DAA), was applied to a case-control study of Crohn's disease. Traditional MWAS lost power to identify the link between phenotype and microbiota, and an unbounded number of detections were observed, suggesting previously reported associations could be indirect. The study estimated the contribution of indirect to MW and isolated direct associations, showing interactions generate detectable changes in abundance not linked to host.
Researchers compared the effects of Wolbachia infection on the replication and transmission of two flaviviruses, Dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) viruses, in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes using two Wolbach infection models: stable transfection and transient infection. Stable Wolbach infection has been shown to inhibit various pathogens, including DENV, CHV, WNV, and Plasium, but some studies suggest Wolbach can enhance pathogen replication under specific conditions. In this study, Wolbach had similar blocking effects in both stable and transient models, but the magnitude was lower in transiently infected mosquitoes. No enhancement of DENV or WNV Kun strain infection was observed in Wolbach infected Ae.egypt, supporting Wolbach as a safe means to restrict transmission. Wolbach density was correlated with pathogen blocking in Wolia hosts, and lower densities in transient mosquitoes explain reduced D blocking. Experiments were repeated with WNV Kun strain, with similar results. Wolbach density was lower in transient compared to stable infected.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, cilia are microtub-based organelles that mediate signal transduction and are organized into structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the basal body, the transition zone (TZ), and the cilium. In vertebrates, the protein Invers localizes to a portion of the cilium adjacent to the TZ, termed the Invers compartment (Inv). The mechanisms that establish and maintain the Inv are unknown. In C. elegans, the cilia of amphid and phasm sensory cilia are subdivided into regions by different microtub ultrastructure: a proximal doublet region adjacent to the TZ and distal singlet region. It has been suggested that C. elegans cilia possess an Inv, similar to mammalian primary cilia. This study explored the biogenesis, structure, and composition of C. eleg ciliary double region and Inv. The Inv is conserved and distinct from the double region. n-2 (C eleg Invers hom) and double region genes l-13, l-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for cili. Inv and double region can be sorted into modules n-2p-11 and l-13-119, which are antagonized by hd- deacetyl. The genes modulate the sizes of N- Inv and A- double region. Glutlation, a tub-trans modification, is not required for ciliary of Inv and double components; rather, glut is modulated by-2, -13, and-119. The ciliary and localization of N-, A-, and UNC does not require TZ, double region and Inv-associated. N- requires its calcium EF domain for targeting Inv. The C eleg Inv is distinct from double region, and components interact to regulate cili via placement, ciliary microtub ultra, and protein.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the polarity protein Scribble in myelination and remyination in the central nervous system. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendrocy development and is upregulated in mature oligodrocytes, where it localizes to developing and mature myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scri expression in cultured oligodrocy results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. Conditional elimination of Scri in myinating glia of transgenic mice disrupts myelination in CNS during development and following demyelination, and myelin sheath extension is disrupted at later stages. Scribble acts to regulate myelin thickness by suppressing extracellular signal-related kinase (ER)/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and localizes to noncompact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it is required for axo-glial adhesion. Scri function is compartmentalized through interactions with different protein complexes at radial or longitudinal growth sites. Scri plays a role in oligodrocy morphological differentiation, myelin initiation, and myelin regulation, and also in myelin regeneration. Scri is restricted to noncompact myelin membranes, localizing to axo-gl adhesion sites. Oligodrocy differentiation is not affected in Scri knockdown conditions, but myelination is disrupted. In vivo, myelination in CNS is disrupted in Scri cKO mice. Myelin thickness is increased in developed tracts in ScriKO oligrocy, but not in remyelination. Small diameter axons lack myelin sheaths in Scri c CNS.
Researchers have identified a novel peptide, Listerin S, associated with a subset lineage of Listeria monocytogen, a Gram-positive pathogen responsible for listeriosis. Listerin S is a hemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor, contributing to the pathogen's virulence in murine and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil-based studies. This finding expands the family of modified virulence peptides (MVPs) and reveals the genetic basis for enhanced virulence in a proportion of lineage L monocytogen. Until now, modified virulence peptides have been rarely reported, and S-like cytolyins were exclusively associated with Streptoccus sp, including group A and G streptocci and Siae, a fish pathogen. However, gene clusters encoding S-like factors are present in other Gram-positive pathogens, including L monocogen, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium botulin. The L monocogen cluster encodes an inducible cytotoxic and hemolytic peptide, Listerin S, which plays a role in path survival in PMNs and contributes to virulence in mouse model. The Listerin-associated cluster is variable, present in subset isolates from lineage I, associated with majority of epidemics of this fatal pathogen. In silico analysis demonstrates gene clusters encoding S-like factors in notorious Gram pathogens, including monocogen, aureus, and botulin.
A study was conducted to investigate the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma granuloma, a persistent granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. The disease is characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains, surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The study aimed to determine if IL-17 and MMP-9 expression correlated with the severity of the disease, independent of the causative agent. Biopsies from 100 patients with myetoma were obtained and IL-17 and MMP-9 expression evaluated immunohistochemically. IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, and less in Zone III, while MMP-9 was mainly in Zones II and III, with least in I. MMP-9 was highly expressed in Actinadura pelletii and Streptomyces somensis biies compared to Madura myetatis biies. MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to IL-17 (p=0.001) and correlated with disease duration (p<0.001). There was no correlation between IL-17 and patients' characteristics. The study demonstrated IL-17 and MMP-9 presence in myet granuloma, with IL-17 more in larger lesions and longer duration. A positive correlation was found between IL-17 and MMP-9 levels. Immunohistochemistry showed IL-17 and MMP-9 presence, but not formation time. Further studies are needed to determine IL-17 and MMP-9 roles in granuloma formation and myet immunogenesis.
Researchers investigated the molecular recognition mechanism of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), specifically the transcription activation domain of the Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein family (E), which exhibits features of "fuzziness", a phenomenon characterized by polyvalency, sequence insensitivity, and dynamic disordered bound-state conformations. They hypothesized that E-target interactions involve polyc-π contacts between disordered E residues and basic target cations. Experimental and theoretical studies of E variants support the c-π model, with trends captured by a coarse-grained E model and analytical interaction between E aromatics and cations. E-target binding is driven by a balance between E conformation entropy and favorable c-π contacts. This versatile recognition mode offers a framework for promiscuous target by polyval IDPs.
Researchers investigated the functions of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium responsible for Lyme disease transmitted by ticks. Previous studies showed that Lon-1 is upregulated in response to blood exposure, while Lon-2 is not. This study aimed to clarify the roles of these proteases in B. burgorferi. Phylogenetic analysis revealed Lon-1 and Lon- cluster separately due to differences in substrate binding domains, suggesting distinct specificity. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited ATP-dependent chaperone-protease properties but did not complement E. coli mutant, while Lon2 corrected Lon-mut phenotypes. The study concludes that B. burgorfer Lon-1 and-2 have distinct functions. Lon-2 functions like canonical Lon in cellular homeostasis, while Lon-1, induced by blood, may be important in host adaptation from arthropod to warm-blood host. The presence of Lon-1 as a feature of Boria indicates its relevance to arthrop-transmitted pathogens. B. burgor Lon-1 may function in host adaptation where it could be a protease during rapid spiroete proliferation during bloodmeal with protein increases. The ability of- and Lon- to complement dysregulate cps implies differential capacity to degrade RA and supports Lonc-like role for- in Boria.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in controlling HIV-1 infection, a mechanism thought to be involved in controlling other viral infections. They measured the ability of HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. Using a green-fluorescent protein-express molecular of HIV-1JR, an R5 clinical isolate, in combination with polyclonal HIV or monoclonal antibodies, they found minimal or no AD of virions with any antibodies. However, coating virions with gp41 or gp-derived peptides gp41, but not gp120-specific antibodies efficiently mediated phagocytosis. A minimum of a hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagytosis, similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses phagocosed, such as influenza. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy showed a clear association between virus aggregation and AD. In contrast, vir-decorated cells were targets for AD orgocytosis in presence of HIV antibodies. Findings indicate AD of vir may not play a role in preventing infection due to paucity of trimers and inability of vir-bound antibody to cross FcRs on phocytes. However, AD orocyt could play in clearing infected cells on verge of infection.
A global study estimated the economic and health burden of hookworm infection in 2016 from a societal perspective, using a computational model. The results showed that hookworm infection resulted in 2,126,280 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) using 200 disability estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 201 estimates, excluding cognitive impairment. Including cognitive impairment did not significantly increase DALs worldwide. Productivity losses varied with anemia calculation method, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion using Gross National Income (GNI) per capita as a proxy and from $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy. The study found that hookworm's economic burden exceeded estimates of diseases with more attention, such as rotavirus. Countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face considerable hook burden. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 reported 3,230,800 DALs annually due to hook among all ages in 21 regions, including disability weights for hook outcomes and anemia, but not cognitive impairment. Assuming median anemia, hook infections resulted in productivity losses $11.1 billion (95%: $5.5-18.5) using Method 1, $87.9 (95: $1.7-302.3) Method 2, and $23.1 (95:11.4-38.4) Method 3. Using minimum wage, global burden was $3 billion.
Researchers investigated the effects of hypoxia on the developing brain in vertebrates, specifically zebraf (Danio rerio), and found that it disrupts axon pathfinding in forebrain neurons, leading to commissural axons failing to cross the midline. This occurs through activation of the hypox-inducible transcription factor (HIF) pathway, mimicked by chemical inducers of HIF or expression of constitutively active Hα. Blocking transcriptional activation of Hα prevented guidance defects. EphrinB2 was identified as a target of H pathway activation, with knockdown of EphB rescuing guidance errors and receptor EphA expressed in a pattern complementary to misrouting axons. Constitutively active EphB targeted to neurons mediated errors via reverse-signaling. Magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopment outcomes in prebirths, protected against errors by preventing upregulation of EphB. These results demonstrate evolutionarily conserved pathways regulate changes in CNS response to hypox, supporting a neuroprotective role for magnesium.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate pulmonary abnormalities in mice with paracidiomycosis using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathological findings. Paracidiomycosis is a fungal disease that affects the lungs and can spread to other parts of the body. The study aimed to define patterns and intensity of lung lesions in infected mice by comparing HRCT and histopathology. Male BALB mice were inoculated with Paracoides brasiliensis conidia or PBS. HRCT was done every 4 weeks to determine lung lesions, density, and structure. Lungs were analyzed by histology and histometry. Three lesion patterns were found: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-oral. Lesions were mainly around the hilus and affected the left lung. At 4 weeks post-challenge, 80% of infected mice had peri-bronial consolidations with increased lung density compared to controls. After 8 and 12 weeks, consolidation progressed to middle regions. Histology showed consolidation as confl granulomatous reaction, nodules as compact granomas. At 16 weeks, confl granomas formed pseudooral masses obstructing bronchi. Discrete fibrosis was visible around granomas but only by histology. This study showed HRCT is useful for evaluating and quantifying damage in experimental paridiomycosis.
Researchers conducted a proof-of-concept study to evaluate the interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γ) as a marker for latent Leishmania donovani (L. donov) infection in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) endemic areas. They modified a commercial kit, QuFERON, with five Leish-specific antigens: H2, H2-PS2, H-Le12, crude antigen (CSA), and soluble Leish antigen (SL) L. don to detect cell-mediated response in VL. The study included 13 active VL patients, 15 cured patients, 11 non-endemic controls, and 19 healthy controls. The assay based on SL had 80% sensitivity (95% CI 54.81-92.95) and 100% specificity (95 CI 74.12-100). Results suggest a whole-blood SL-based QuFER assay can measure cell response in L. don infection. Positive IF-γ response to Leish antigen in VL patients contradicts conventional non-proliferative antigen response in peripheral mononuclear cells, requiring further research.
Researchers have discovered that the CNFY toxin, a virulence factor produced by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, plays a crucial role in the bacteria's ability to establish a persistent infection in the host. The toxin enhances the translocation of anti-phagocytic effectors, leading to inflammatory responses, tissue destruction, and alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance suppression. However, suppression of CNFY function increases interferon-mediated responses, non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities, and tolerogenesis, allowing the bacteria to reprogram its transcriptional response towards persistence. This adaptation gives the bacteria a fitness advantage against host responses and facilitates a commensal lifestyle. The study demonstrates that removal of a single virulence factor, CNFY, is sufficient to dampen inflammation and evade the host's defense, favoring Yers persistence. The mechanisms behind this process are unclear, but the impact of CNFY suggests a set of immune responses, including IL-6 levels, immune modulators, bactericidal activities, and anti-inflammatory factors, which contribute to this process. Suppression of CNFY shifts the balance of bacteria-triggered inflammation and clearance towards immune suppression, promoting establishment of asymptomatic infection.
Researchers have identified a novel pathogenic gene, DES1, in the fungus Magnaporthe oryza, which plays a crucial role in suppressing the basal defenses of the host plant during colonization. The gene was discovered through screening for pathogenic-defective mutants in a T-DNA insertional mutant library. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DES encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties and homologs conserved in filamentous Ascomyc. Targeted deletion of DES had no effect on developmental morphogenesis, vegetative growth, conial germination, appressium formation, and appressium-mediated penetration. However, conial size of mutant was smaller than wild type, but mutant showed no defects in cell wall integrity. The Δdes mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous stress and activity and transcription of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and lacc, were decreased in mutant. Additionally, ferrous ion leakage was observed in Δdes mutant. In interaction with susceptible rice cultivar, cells inoculated with Δdes exhibited strong defense responses, including brown granules in primary cells, accumulation of reactive species (ROS), generation autofluorescent materials, and PR induction in neighboring tissues. Δdes displayed significant reduction in hyal extension, causing decrease in pathogenicity. Suppression of ROS by treatment with dipheniodium (DPI), inhibitor of NAD oxidases, resulted in significant reduction in defense in tissues challenged with Δdes. Furthermore, Δdes recovered normal growth in DPI-treated tissues. Results suggest DES functions as novel pathogenic gene regulating activity of proteins, compromising plant defense.
Researchers evaluated the accuracy of a predictive model-based (MB) approach for mapping schistosomiasis prevalence in Ghana by comparing it with empirical data from school-based surveys. The study found that using the predicted values alone, 21 out of 25 schools determined to be high-risk for Schistosoma haematium infection would have been undertreated, and 20% of schools would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection, resulting in 28% of children being undertreated and 12% receiving unnecessary treatment. The predictive map was not adequate for guiding the national program when aggregated to the district level, but assessing each school in potentially endemic areas is not feasible; modeling should be a complementary to empirical assessments. The study suggests predictive mapping should be an iterative process incorporating empirical testing and refining to create updated versions meeting disease control managers' needs.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms guiding motile sperm through the reproductive tract to oocytes in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that oocytes synthesize sperm-guiding prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUA) precursors in yolkoprotein complexes. Using genetics and electrospray ion tandem mass spectrometry, they partially delineated F-series prostland metabolism. Omega-6 and omega-3 PAs, including arachid and eicosapentaic acids, are converted into more than 10 structurally related F prostagland, which collectively and redundantly promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 PU synthesis triggers compensatory upregulation prostagins from omega-6 PAs. C elegans prostland synthesis involves biochemical mechanisms distinct from mammalian cycxygen-dependent pathways, yet PG2 stereomers are synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Bti Crystine dystrophy, regulates prostland synthesis. Results support the model multiple cycxygen-independent prostland function to promote sperm motility for fertilization.
Researchers have developed a new approach to design biotherapeutics with reduced immunogenicity, a major barrier to their clinical application. They used algorithms to optimize proteins for low T cell epitope content and high function, revealing a spectrum of designs that trade off between immunogenicity and function. The Pareto frontier, a set of undominated variants with no single better performance in both criteria, was constructed and experimentally evaluated. Eighteen variants were produced and analyzed for performance, correlating with computational predictions. This work outlines a design-based approach to functional deimmization of biotherapeutic candidates. Next-generation protein deimmization tools integrate epitope prediction with in silico analysis of functional consequences, enabling global design on a compressed scale. Predictions correlated with experimental function, showing incremental T epitope deletion leads to concomitant loss of function. Tradeoffs were borne out in real analyses. The Pareto designs reveal an inverse relationship: greater deimmization at expense of reduced function. To assess implications, 18 enzymes were recombinantly produced and characterized for stability, activity, and immunoreactivity with human MHC proteins.
Researchers investigated the effect of elevated temperature on meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis thalian, a plant species that undergoes sexual reproduction through meiosis. Meiosis relies on the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes, known as crossovers (CO), to ensure proper chromosome segregation. The frequency and distribution of COs are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, but more is known about the molecular mechanisms governing the former than the latter. The study found that elevated temperature increases meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis and used genetic analysis of mutants in recombination pathways to demonstrate that extra COs are derived from the Type I interference pathway. This pathway is sensitive to interference, whereas the Type II pathway is not. The study also showed that heat-induced COs are not due to an increase in double-strand breaks and the hyperrecombination phenotype is specific to thermal stress rather than a generalized response. The findings provide insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may offer practical applications.
Researchers have developed a novel computational approach to navigate the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of biomedical literature, particularly in molecular medicine, by creating a knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning, and reporting to facilitate data analysis. This system, called Hanalyzer, extracts information from external resources, structured or unstructured data using natural language processing, and tracks provenance. Reasoning enriches the knowledge by noting genes annotated to the same ontology or database and combines sources into a network representing relationships between genes, calculating a reliability score. Reporting combines the network with congruent constructed from experimental data and visualizes in a tool for knowledge-based analysis. Hanalyzer was demonstrated on a large-scale gene array dataset relevant to craniofacial development, identifying roles of four previously uncharacterized genes, validated by further work.

The system includes a plugin, Coscape, tracing provenance links and accessing sources (Figure 2), and exploiting inferences not in individual sources. To present relevant knowledge, sub-networks are selected and presented comprehensively, visualizing with fidials or generating sub-networks. A more effective method is creating a data network from experimental results and combining in various ways. In this application, a data was constructed from gene expression experiment relevant to cranfac.
Helminth parasites, specifically Fasciola hepatica, secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be internalized by host cells, modulating the host's immune response. While the cargo of EVs has been characterized in many parasites, little is known about the surface-exposed molecules that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with host cells to initiate vesicle docking and internalization. This study used membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins on the outer surface of two subpopulations (15k and 120 EV) released by adult F. hepatica, describing 380 proteins including virulence factors, membrane proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis showed 120 EVs have endosomal origin and may be released via the protonephial excretory system, while larger 15 EV are from gastrodermal epithelial cells lining the gut. Lectin microarray strategy profiled surface oligosaccharides of intact fluorically labelled EV, showing identical glycoconates on 15 and 120 EV but distinct from parasite tegument, predominated by mannose sugars. EV were resistant to exo and endoglycosases, but glycosidase PNG remodelled surface and blocked uptake by macrophages. Pre-treatment with antibodies from infected hosts or purified against EV surface proteins significantly enhanced internalization.
Researchers have identified a cycling DOF transcription factor, C2 (CDF2), which plays a crucial role in regulating microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis in plants. miRNAs are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-mi) by RNA polymerase II and then cleaved into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 (DCL). CDF2 interacts with CL and regulates the accumulation of a population of miRNAs by binding directly to the promoters of some miRNA genes, acting as a transcriptional activator or repressor. It also binds preferentially to pri-mi regulated by itself and affects CL-mediated processing of these prii. Genetically, C2 works in the same pathway as mi156 or mi172 to control flowering. C2 regulates a group of prii at both transcription and post-transcription levels to maintain proper levels of mature miRN to control plant development. This regulation is achieved through coordination of transcription and processing of a group of prii. C2 also regulates expressions of components involved in mi biogenesis, potentially affecting biogenesis by regulating levels of these components.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GG) in the establishment of communication between oocytes and granulosa cells in the ovary, a process essential for folliculogenesis and female fertility. GG, a metabolic intermediate in protein geranylation, increases in oocytes during early follicular development. Depletion of GG in oocytes impairs granosa cell proliferation, primary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GG depletion inhibits Rho GTPase geranylation and GTP activity, leading to accumulation of junction proteins in oocyte cytoplasm and disrupted oocyte-granosa contact. GG also blocks Rab27 geranylation, affecting secretion of oocyte materials such as G9. Administration of GG restores defects in o-granosa contact, granosa proliferation, and primary follicle transition in Gpps mice. This study demonstrates GG-mediated geranylation contributes to o-granosa communication and regulates primary follicle transition, a key phase of folliculogenesis.
Researchers have created a structural model of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation complex with a complete transcription bubble to understand how nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates enter the active site of the enzyme. Despite previous biochemical and biophysical studies, it was unclear whether the secondary channel was the only route for NTP entry or if the main channel could be an alternative. Crystallographic structures of Pol II have provided insight into the basis of transcription, but the conformation of the unpaired non-template part of the transcription bubble (TB) was unknown. The researchers used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and structural analysis to shed light on NTP pathways. They found that both channels have enough space for N loading, but the percentage of conformations with space for N loading through the secondary channel is twice that of the main. Energetic simulations with N loaded in channels revealed diffusion through the main is disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between N and negatively charged nucleotides in non-template DNA. Results suggest the secondary channel is major for N entry during Pol transcription.
Dengue is a reportable disease in Thailand and Cambodia, but the reported incidence underestimates the true burden of the disease. Researchers used laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases from prospective studies to estimate the magnitude of deng underrecognition and establish accurate burden estimates for these countries. Cohort studies were conducted among children under 15 years of age from a deng field site consortium over two deng seasons. Age-specific multiplication factors (MF) were computed by comparing cohort data to national surveillance in the same province and year. In Thailand, 14,627 person-years of cohort data were obtained in two provinces and 14,493-years from one in Cambodia. Average incidence of laboratory-confirmed deng was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand, and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Calculated MF in provinces varied by age and year (0.4-29). Average age-specific MF applied to country data indicated in Thailand 229,886 (210,612-331,236) deng cases annually 2003-2007 and 111,178 (80,452,357,135) in Cambodia. Underrecognition total inpatient deng cases 8.7 and 2.6 in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4 in Cambodia. During high incidence 2007, over 95,000 in Thailand and 58,000 in Cambodia estimated hospitalized due to deng. Calculating MF comparing cohort to surveillance is one approach to assess burden. Data indicate deng reported many countries underestimates true disease. 

A study demonstrated non-hospital patients deng represent substantial burden. D has been major health problem in Thailand and Cambodia, children under 15 especially affected. Both DF notifiable.4 (0.02) underestimation inpatient in 2003-07. Estimates 111,178 (80,452,357,135) symptomatic d occurred each year maximum 58,118 in 2007. Age-specific and application nationally data shown Table 3.7 and 1.1. Incidence over periods 2.6/1,000 Kameng and 4.5/1,000 Ratchuri. Applying average 8.7 (0.13) underrec total symptomatic in each year. Country factors derived studies or capture useful national data assess burden economic. Estimating under on provincial (1) and ratio (2) showed variation years and age within sites.
This study investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in promoting CD8 T cell responses against cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Researchers used congenic or mutant mice and genetically engineered viruses to examine the consequences of NK cell defects on antiviral CD8 cell responses. The results showed that NK cells accelerate CD8 cell responses in vivo by limiting immunosup IF-α/β production, which reduces plasmacyoid dendritic cell (pDC) cytokine production, preserves conventional dendritic cell (DC) compartment, and accelerates antiral CD8 cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IF-α administration in animals ablates DCs and delays CD8 cell activation in the face of NK control viral replication. The study demonstrates that NK cells' ability to respond early to CMV infection critically contributes to the balance of innate responses, dampening immunopathology and promoting initiation of antiral CD8 cell. The findings indicate that NK cells serve as regulators of immune defenses against viral infections, controlling pDC functions and modulating cytokine milieu early after challenge, and accelerating effector antiral CD8 cell generation.
Researchers investigated the role of the nucleolin protein (NUC1) in regulating the expression of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Arabidopsis thalian plants. They found that disruption of the NU1 gene affects the expression of specific rRNA variants, with some being induced and others repressed or unchanged. Notably, the most highly represented rRNA variant, inactive in wild-type plants, is reactivated in NU1 mutants. The study shows that pre-rNAs originate from RNA polymerase I transcription and are accurately processed. Disruption of the NU1 gene leads to loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone epigenetic marks on r genes. The results reveal a novel mechanism for r gene transcription regulation, with NU1 playing a major role in controlling active and repressed r variants. The study also found that NU1 localizes with approximately half of r loci in the nucleus and associates with transcriptionally active r genes. The accumulation of pre-r in mutants is likely due to higher RNA I transcription from intergenic spacer regions. NU1 binds to r promoter sequences and directs transcription from transcription initiation site.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins UL29 and UL38 interact with the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and components of the nucleosome remodeling and deetylase complex (Nu) to promote the accumulation of immediate-early RNA. A study identified HD1-interacting proteins in the context of infection using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, confirming the interaction of UL29 and UL38 with HD1. HD1 is present in various complexes, including Nu, REST, and Sin3. UL29 and UL38 associated with the M2 component of Nu, and RNA-mediated knockdown of RBP and CH4 constituents of Nu inhibited CM immediateearly and viral DNA accumulation. This suggests that multiple Nu components are needed for efficient CM replication. The growth of UL29- or UL38 deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating cells with the deetyl inhibitor trichostatin A. Transient expression of UL29 enhanced the CM major early promoter in a reporter assay, regardless of UL expression. Importantly, induction of the major early reporter by UL29 required Nu components, consistent with inhibition of early RNA accumulation after knockdown of RBP and CH4. The study proposes that UL29 modifies the Nu complex to stimulate early RNAs.
Researchers investigated the antibody responses to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in children following primary infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. Whole-genome-fragment display libraries (GFPDL) were used to identify linear and conformational epitopes in the RSV fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins in infant sera before and after infection. F-GDL showed modest changes in anti-F epitope repertoire post-infection, while GDL revealed a 100-fold increase in G-reactive epitopes spanning the N- and C-terminus of G ectodomain, with increased reactivity to conserved domain CCD. Panels of F and G antigen sites were synthesized to evaluate sera from children, adolescents, and adults in real-time assays. A steady increase in RSV epitope repertoire from children to adults was observed using peptides and proteins. Novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion F and immunodominant in F27. Antibody to preusion was 2-3 folds higher than postusion. R-G responses were high early in children but declined in adults using proteins or peptides. This study shows unlinked evolution of anti-F and G responses and evidence for immune driven R-G evolution.
Researchers investigated the mode of action of emodeide, a veterinary anthelmint, against adult Brug malayi, a species causing lymphatic filariasis. Whole-paras motility and patch-clamp studies showed emide potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. RNAi knockdown suggested emide targets S-1 channels. Expressed slo-1 isoforms with alternatively spliced exons at the RCK domain were heterologously expressed in Xenopus lae oocytes. The slo-1 iso found in males was more sensitive to emide than slo-1a found in females, and RNAi of slo-1 in females increased emide potency. Onchercovulus, causing river blindness, had two isoforms with homology to B-S-1 and B-F at R1 domain. In silico modeling identified an emide binding pocket in R1 region affected by splicing variations. The study shows emide has potent macrofidal effects and splicing in R1 binding affects potency.
Researchers investigated the cross-reactivity of Loa loa antigens with lymphatic filariasis rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to understand the obstacle to lymphatic filariasis elimination in Loa-endemic areas. They used the D6.5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa antigens from sera of individuals with positive Loa RDT results. Immunoblot analysis revealed many AD/DH.5-reactive antigens, and proteomic analysis identified multiple Lo proteins in Loa R-positive sera, including secreted and somatic proteins that may be released by Loa adult worms and microfilariae. Unlike the high molecular weight W. bancroft circulating antigen, Lo antigens appeared transiently present in blood of a subset Loa persons. The differences between antigens of W. bancft and Lo can be used to differentiate results of both species, leading to improved tests for Loa and W. bancft. Loa antigens occur by process different from W. banc CFA, likely due to Loa death and adult worms releasing multiple AD glycoproteins into circulation and imbalance between release and clearance of antigens accounts for detection in circulation of Loa patients. Serum from Lo R-negative individuals, including those previously W bancft R positive, were negative for AD antig by western blot. Immunoaffinity-purified antig from sample 355 and pooled sera were analyzed by protease digestion and LC/MS/MS, matching spectra to Loa genomes.
Researchers used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to identify new genes associated with primary cilia, which are sensory and signalling devices extending from the surface of eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organel cause human disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bard-Bied syndrome (BBS), affecting multiple physiological and developmental processes across organs. Whole-organ RNA-Seq libraries revealed a signature profile highly enriched for known ciliary transcripts, including FAM161, CC104, and RP1. From a list of 185 candidates, orthologues of MAP, YAP, CC149, and R28 were conserved cilium components. C elegans R-28, associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, is a small GTPase exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, dynamically associating with intraflagellar transport (IFT) trains. Inactive GDP-bound R-28 shows no IFT and diffuse localisation, while GTP-activated R-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane in BBS-dependent and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Overexpression of GDP or GTP locked R-28 variants perturbs cilium and sensory morphogenesis. This study presents a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveils R28, a GTP closely related to B protein R4/IFT, as I-associated with BBS-dependent cell and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents the external world using neural responses without direct access to external stimuli. They used hippocampal place cells as a model and found that knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals structure in the stimulus space, enabling the brain to construct its own representations. The study showed that knowing which groups of hippocamp cells fire is enough to extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of space, including the animal's position. This is different from previous approaches that required knowing place fields or other neural responses relating to position. The research found that simple knowledge of groups of hippocamp cells can infer topological features of a two-dimensional environment and geometric reconstruction of physical space, including the animal's position, without assuming place fields or prior measurements of position. This challenges the idea that place fields are necessary for reconstructing position from cell activity. The study identified minimal aspects of neural activity that yield an accurate representation of space, showing that coarse population spiking features can provide a great deal of information about the environment.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP inflamome and IL-1β in viral fulminant hepatitis (FH), a severe liver disease with high mortality due to excessive inflammation. Wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus-3 (MH-3) showed severe disease and high mortality associated with significant IL-1β elevation in serum and liver. In contrast, IL-1 receptor deficient (IL-1R-/-) or IL-1 antagonist (IL-Ra) treated mice had reduced virus replication, disease, and mortality. IL-1R deficiency debilitated virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (F2) production in macrophages and CD45+Gr1 neutrophil infiltration in liver. The release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by infected macrophages suggested plausible initiation of NLR3 inflamome activation. Mice deficient in p47phox, a nicotin adenine dinucleotide (NAD) oxidase subunit controlling ROS production, had reduced NLR inflamome activation and IL-β secretion during infection, showing resilience to FH. Viral animals deficient in NLR and caspase-1, inflamome components, had reduced IL-β and ameliorated hepatitis. The ROS/NLR3/IL-β axis is an essential pathway causing severe liver disease during infection, shedding light on treatments for human FH and inflammatory diseases.
Researchers conducted a study in Malawi to investigate the role of hookworm infections in severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. Using multiplex real-time PCR, they found that 34.1% of severely anemic children and 27.0% non-severely anemic controls had hookworm infections, whereas microscopy detected 5.6%. Ancylostoma duale and Necator americanus DNA were present in 26.1% and 4.9% of children, respectively. Moderate to high A. duale infections were associated with severe anemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.49, 95% CI 1.16-5.33 and 9.04, 95 CI 2.52-32.47) and iron deficiency (odds ratio 3.63, 95 CI 1.18-11.20, 16.98 95 CI 3.88.74.35 and 44.91 95 5.23-385.77 for low, moderate and high load). This is the first study to assess hook load and species with anemia and bone iron deficiency. The study found a higher than expected prevalence of A. duale and significant association with anemia and iron in pre-school children in Malawi, highlighting the need for species-specific screening. Multiplex real PCR is a powerful tool for public health to combat severe anemia and iron deficiency in resource settings.
Researchers have identified a protein called COM-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis. Meiosis is a process of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells to produce gametes. DS can be repaired via two ways: homologous recombination (HR) or non-homous joining (NHE). Only HR can generate interhom crossovers (COs) needed for meiotic segregation. COM-1-deficient cells repair DS via error-prone NHE, resulting in lack of CO, chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. Unlike its yeast counterparts, COM-1 is not required for Spo11 and initiation of meiotic DS repair, but promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting NHE complex. Animals defective in both COM1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. COM1 acts parallel to nuclease EX-1 to promote interolog HR at early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and safeguards CO formation. Both nucleases are dispensable for RAD-51 recruitment late pach stage when hom-independent pathways predominate.
Researchers studied the immune response of goats to Burkholderia pseudallei, a bacterium causing meloidosis, a severe pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Australia. They used an aerosol infection model to mimic human infection and characterized the humoral immune response to identify immunogenic proteins for diagnostics and vaccine candidates. Outbred goats were used instead of inbred mice to better mimic human infection. Antigen proteins from infecting strain MSH511 were analyzed by ELISA, western blot, and mass spectrometry. Results showed a greater humoral response with IgG antibodies in breadth and quantity compared to IgM. Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins reactive for IgG (7-20) and IgM(0-12) despite no previous exposure. After infection, IgG reactive proteins increased as disease progressed. Early infection (day 7) showed reaction to chaper proteins Gro, EL, EFu, and Dna, detected in all samples with Gro immunodominant. Six antigens were selected for ELISA, Gro1 elicited strongest antibody response. Most showed IgM peak at day 14, IgG increased as disease progressed. MSH511 proteomic comparison with human sera showed common reactive proteins between goats and humans with meloid.
Researchers have investigated the activation of cyclin B–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk) in mitosis, a key event that initiates mitotic entry. They used a novel approach to determine the temporal development of cyclin B–dk activity in single cells, quantifying dephosphorylation of C and phosphorylation of the anaphase-promoting/cycome 3. The study found that cyclin B–dk continues to be activated after centros separation and can be maintained in the cytoplasm even when cyclin B translocates to the nucleus in prophase. The data were fitted into a model describing cyclin Bdk activation in human cells, revealing a resemblance to a bistable circuit. The results indicate that mit cyclin Bdk activity needs to increase after mitotic entry and pass a threshold before metaphase to allow mitotic progression and exit. Distinct thresholds for cyclin Bdk activity control successive mitotic events. Cyclin Bdk is activated in late G2 and increases between centros separation and prometaph. Reducing C1 levels affects mitotic progression, with a threshold that autocatalyzes further cyclin Bdk activation and entry into mitosis. Cyclin Bdk contributes to centros separation in G and is initially detected on centros before they separate in G or pro.
A study examined the neutralizing antibody responses in 21 Kenyan women who were superinfected with HIV-1 subtypes A, C, and D after a median of 1.07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples were collected at a median 2.72 years post-superinfection. The study focused on 4 main epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope, including the CD4 binding site, V1/V glycan, N332 site in V3, and membrane proximal external gp41. Epitope mapping and computational analyses showed no dominant response to these epitopes in any of the superinfected women's plasma. In contrast, 72-94% of singly infected individuals with broad and potent responses develop antibodies targeting these 4 epitopes. The study suggests that superinfection with diverse subtypes promotes a polyclonal response, supporting vaccine designs using multivalent immunogens to elicit diverse neutralizing antibodies.
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. CMV dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes) is essential for NPC fate and brain development as a downstream effector of Notch signaling. This study reports that CMV downregulates Hes protein levels in NPCs. The CMV 72Da immediate-early 1 (IE1) protein is involved in Hes degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex, promoting Hes ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes. SpA, a component of PML bodies, is another target of IE-mediated ubiquination. The C-terminal region of IE, amino acids 451-475, is required for IE/Hes interaction and IE-mediated Hes ubiquination, but dispensable for IE/SpA interaction and ubiquination. This study suggests a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes protein to neurodevelopment disorders caused by CMV infection, complementing knowledge of herpesviruses by identifying IE as the first CM-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.
Researchers investigated the divergence of transcription factor binding and gene expression in Drosophila embryos across four species: D. melanogaster, D. yak, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. They compared gene expression levels measured by mRNA-seq to genome-wide binding measured by ChIP-seq of four transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior patterning. Results showed that mRNA levels are more conserved than individual factor binding events, and changes in gene expression were poorly explained by changes in factor binding. However, highly bound sites in regions bound by multiple factors and near genes are conserved more frequently, suggesting weak or non-functional factor binding not subject to purifying selection.

The study found extensive divergence of transcription factor binding within the Dophila genus, with few regions bound by factors in all four species. Comparing divergence to divergence, only 3-7% of variance in binding between species was explained (21% if phylogenetic inertia not considered). mRNA-seq from embryos at end of cellularization showed highly correlated levels between species, decaying with phylogenetic distance. Divergence of mRNA was lower than TF binding, as measured by variance along Dila tree.

Two sources of binding divergence were identified: alterations of B, HB, GT, and KR motifs driving a portion of divergence. ChIP log-transformed values were normalized for comparisons of gene expression, showing highly correlated levels between species, decaying with phylogen distance. Divergence of mRNA was lower than TF binding, as variance along Dila tree.
Epidemiological Assessment of Eight Rounds of Mass Drug Administration for Lymphatic Filariasis in India: Implications for Monitoring and Evaluation

A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjav district, India, endemic for bancroftian filariasis, which had undergone eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA). The study aimed to address issues with the current monitoring and evaluation process for lymphatic filariasis elimination, including transmission surveys (TAS) that assess antigenemia (Ag) in children who have completed at least five rounds of MDA with > 65% coverage and microfilaria (M) <1% in monitored sites. The study found prevalence and intensity of M (per 60µl) were 0.2% and 0.004 respectively in the survey covering >70% of 50,363 population. Corresponding values for Ag were 2.3 and 17.3 Ag-units. Ag-preval ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 in children (2-10) and 2.7 to 3.0 in adults. Although M-levels in survey and sentinel spot sites were <1 and Ag-level <2 in children, seven "residual" M-preval ≥1, irrespective of Ag-status in children and 17 "transmission" at least Ag-positive child during MDA hotspots were identified. Antigenemic persons were clustered at household and site levels. An Ag-preval of ~1 in children equivalent 0.4 M-preval as possible threshold for stopping MDA.

The study suggests that transmission in the area has reduced to <1 Ag-preval in children, supporting decision for stopping M in the area. However, several sites with potential for resurgence and clustering of infections were identified, indicating the need for developing strategies detecting hotspots, evidence-based sampling, and evaluation size for TAS.
This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of temeph, an organophosphate laricide, in controlling deng vectors and deng transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other methods. A comprehensive literature search of six databases and grey literature was conducted, and 27 studies were included. Eleven single-intervention studies showed temos reduced entomological indices, while 11 of 16 combined intervention studies showed temos with other chemical control methods reduced entom indices, but this was not sustained in five studies. The effectiveness of temos was dependent on factors such as delivery quality, water rate, type, and environmental factors like debris, temperature, and sunlight. Timing of tem deployment and reapplication, application reluctance to drinking water, cost, supplies, time, and labor were limitations. As a single intervention, temos was effective in suppressing entom indices, but not when combined with other interventions. No evidence suggests temos use reduces deng transmission. This review highlights the effectiveness of temos varies greatly, and lack of data on entom indices to d transmission remains a gap in deng epidemiology and control.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Ctf19 kinetore complex and the replication factor C3 in establishing cohesion at the pericentere, the region surrounding the centromere. They found that these two factors act through distinct mechanisms, with the C19 complex directing the association of cohes with the pericere and C3 ensuring its functionality in holding sister centeres together. Components of the C19 complex, Iml and Ch4, were shown to increase cohes association with the pericere during mitosis and meiosis, while C3 is dispensable for cohes enrichment in the perere but essential for its functionality. Cells lacking C3 showed additive cohesion defects with mutants in the C19 complex. Delaying replication rescued the defect in cells lacking C19 components but not C3. The study proposes that the C19 complex loads cohes at the centere prior to replication fork passage, ensuring its incorporation through a process requiring C3. The C19 complex and C3 are conserved, and their mechanism may operate in organisms with perenteric heterochatin attracting cohes.
Researchers conducted a study on the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients with deng fever/deng hemorrhagic fever (DF) to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of deng pathogenesis. Using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, they analyzed serum samples from 44 patients across three stages of infection: early febrile, defesc, and convalescence. The study identified 60 differential metabolites, primarily in fatty acids, acylcarnines, phospholids, and amino acids, which perturbed pathways such as fatty acid biosynthesis, β-oxidation, phosphid catabolism, and steroid pathway. These changes suggest a multifactorial host response to DENV infection. Analysis of phosphids and sphingids revealed temporal trends associated with lymphocytes and platelets, which normalized at convalescent stage, indicating potential as prognostic markers. DENV causes distinct serumome and lipidome changes, with many metabolites involved in inflammatory responses. The study shows early anti-inflammatory responses modulate pro-inflammatory processes, preventing excessive or prolonged inflammation. This is the first omic approach to reveal concurrent, dynamic host responses to DENV, providing physiological insights into why DF is self-limiting.
Researchers analyzed 26,833 publications on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) published between 2002-2012 to identify German contributions to NTD research. They used bibliometric data from Scopus, OpenRef, OpenStreet, and Gephi to create co-author networks. 1,187 (4.4%) of publications had at least one German affiliation, with 4,007 authors and 863 institutions extracted. Most co-authors were from high-income countries, Brazil. Collaborations with African countries were scattered. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. Strong performers were identified by publication number, h-index, and network centrality. Network characteristics varied between diseases. NTD publications with German affiliations were half of other medical fields, highlighting the need to identify and expand German research efforts. Spatial analysis of collaborations abroad supports capacity strengthening, particularly in low-middle income countries less involved than high-income. Identifying knowledge within researcher networks complements traditional indicators for collaboration opportunities.
In Haiti, a mass drug administration (MDA) program targeting lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helmin (STH) has been implemented since 2000, led by the Ministry of Health and its international partners. By 2012, the program reached national scale with high epidemiological coverage, allowing for treatment cessation of LF in most of the country. Key elements of success included community awareness through evidence-based education, voluntary distributors, community trust through training and supervision, directly observed treatment, easy access, and data-driven strategies. High coverage (100% in 2012) and significant reduction in infection (45 communes reached LF threshold) demonstrate effectiveness. International support enabled steady progress toward LF elimination and foundation for STH control. 

The likelihood of taking treatment was associated with knowledge, disease understanding, transmission, strategy, risk, and side effects in other studies, but not in Haiti, where knowledge was low and not associated with MDA participation. In Grand'An department, prevalence declined less than others, remaining at 55%. Results show progress addressing STH, but highlight post-MDA support challenges. A successful campaign was launched in 200 with high rates, progress toward LF elimination, with more rounds in high prevalence areas and fewer in low. A foundation for STH control was established. Factors determining treatment were knowing MDA and ease of access. Direct observation increased participation in other settings. MDA reaching stopping, Haiti turned to morbidity efforts, building on hydrocele and lymphema support.
Researchers investigated the role of the master regulator Ctr in Sinorhizob meli, an alphrotebacter that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume hosts. In this symbiosis, S. meli undergoes cellular differentiation, resulting in genome amplification, cell elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. The study found that depletion of Ctr causes cell elongation and genome amplification, similar to nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Cell cycle proteolytic degradation of Ctr is essential in S. meli, suggesting a mechanism of Ctr depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using ChIP-Seq and gene microarray analysis, S. mel Ctr regulates similar processes as C cresus Ctr, but through different genes. Ctr does not control Fts complex for cell division timing, but negatively regulates septum-inhibiting Min system. This study provides insight into conserved networks evolving to fit diverse lifestyles of bacteria. The model of Ctr cell regulation in S mel will elucidate bacterial cycle modulation by plant factors during symbiosis.
Francisella tularens is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. Its ability to multiply and survive within macrophages is crucial for its virulence. Researchers screened a library of Himar transposon mutants of the F. tularens vaccine strain L to identify intracellular growth-deficient mutants and isolated a mutant in a gene encoding a putative glutamyl transpeptase (GT). This gene, F_076, was designated ggt. The ggt mutant showed impaired intracellular multiplication and was attenuated virulence in mice. The study demonstrates that GT activity of F. tulns allows utilization of glutathione (GSH, γ-glutyl-cystyl-glycine) and γ-glutyl-cystine dipeptide as cystine to ensure intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the role of a nutrient system in intracellular multiplication of F. tulns. SH is the most abundant source of cystine in host cytos. The capacity of this intracellular pathogen to utilize available SH as cystine host cytos constitutes a paradigm bacteria-host adaptation.
Researchers investigated the interaction between two species of Leishmania parasites, Leishmania amazonensis and Leish major, by infecting macrophages in culture. Leish amazonensis amastotes occupy large parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) containing many parasites, while Leish major amastotes lodge in small, tight PVs that undergo fission as they divide. To determine if PVs of these Leish species can fuse, macrophages were infected with non-fluorescent Leish amazonensis amastotes and 48 hours later superinfected with fluorescent Leish major amastotes or promastigotes. Fusion was investigated by time-lapse acquisition of living cells and inferred from colocalization of parasites of the two species in the same PVs. Results showed that PV containing Leish promastigotes fused with established Leish PVs, but PV containing Leish amastotes did not. In chimeric vacuoles, Le promastigotes remained motile and multiplied but did not differentiate into amastotes. In contrast, in doubly infected cells, unfused PV contained Le promastigotes, which were destroyed or differentiated into proliferating amastotes. This indicates PVs, presumably by Leish amast or promigotes, differ in ability to fuse Leish PV, and species-specific PV is required for Leish differentiation.
Researchers investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed HIV-1 Env trimers to elicit broad neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in a vaccine setting. Potent nAb titers developed in 2 of 8 rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLP) expressing trimers (trimer V sera) and 1 of 20 immunized with DNA expressing Env trimer followed by protein boost (DNAimer sera). All sera neutralized quatern epitopes exploiting gaps in the glycan shield of the conserved region of JRFL gp120. Specifically, trimer V sera took advantage of the absence of glycan residue 197, present in 98.7% Envs. Removing N197 gly with loss of tier 2 phenotype rendered 50 or 16.7% (n=18) clade 2 isolates sensitive to trimer V sera, showing neutralization via surface masked by N glycan. Neutral sera targeted epitopes overlap with CD binding site, consistent with role of N gly in "gly fence" limiting access. Bioinformatics suggested features of trimer V sera and monoclonal PG consistent with tr dependency. Neutral DNAimer took advantage of absence gly residue 230, proximal to CD site, suggesting epitope similar to monoclonal ANC, lacking 2 breadth. Data show strain-specific holes in gly fence allow tier 2 neutral antibodies native spikes. Cross-neutralization occur absence gly. Observations inform future neutral antibody vaccine development.
Researchers investigated the use of immunohistochemistry to monitor wound healing in patients with Buruli ulcers (BU) treated with antibiotics. Traditionally, surgery has been the primary treatment for BU, but a combination of oral rifampicin and intramus streptomycin has improved outcomes and reduced recurrence rates. However, managing extensive lesions after successful therapy remains a challenge, particularly in rural areas with high disease burden. The study aimed to identify markers to monitor wound progression. Specimens from eight patients with plaque lesions before and after chemotherapy were analyzed for connective tissue neoformation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation markers. Several proteins were found suitable to monitor healing. α-smooth muscle actin positive myofiblasts were not present in untreated lesions but emerged during healing, producing extracellular matrix proteins like pro-collagen and tenascin. After treatment, many cells, including myoflasts, showed activated phenotype with ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, a translation marker. Wounds also showed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 in the epidermis. A set of markers was identified to monitor healing in treated BU lesions by immunohchemistry. Studies with this panel may help understand disturbances in wound delays observed in some patients. Activated myoflasts are involved in wound contraction and produce ECM proteins fibronin, tenasc, and proollagens, building granulation tissue for successful healing. Enhanced cytokeratin 16 in lesions after treatment is likely dermal response to antibiotic and mycolone clearing. Each wound phase is characterized by specific cells, proteins, and tasks.
Researchers investigated the relationship between impulse conduction and mitochondrial transport in adult mammalian peripheral nerves in vivo. They used confocal imaging of saphous nerves in anaesthetized mice to study mitochondrial trafficking along resting and electrically active axons. Electrical stimulation at low frequency increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in myelinated and unmyinated axons. Higher frequency conduction (50 Hz) significantly increased anterog, but not retro, mitochondrial traffic by increasing mobile mitochondria number and velocity. Capsaicin application to innervated saph nerve increased mitochondrial traffic in both myinated and uninated axons. Mitochondria in conducting at higher frequency became shorter, supplying additional mitochondria to the population through fission. Recruited mitochondria did not accumulate at Nodes of Ranvier but continued anterograde. This pattern suggests peripheral terminals of sensory axons have high metabolic demand during high frequency conduction. Increased antog traffic may ensure uniform mitochondrial density along axons during high load, supporting metabolic demand by sustained conduction.
A study investigated the role of Filamin B (FLNB) in the development of spondylocarparsal synostosis (SCT), an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions. FLNB acts as a scaffold linking the actin cytoskeleton to signal transduction systems, but the mechanisms of SCT remain unclear. Employing Fln knockout mice, the study found morphologic and molecular evidence that intervertebral discs (IVDs) of Fln-/- mice undergo rapid degeneration during postnatal development due to abnormal cell changes in the IVD, particularly the annulus fibros (AF). In Fln-/- mice, AF cells lose fibroblast characteristics and acquire molecular phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocy, characterized by hallmarks of endochond-like ossification, including collagen expression, apoptosis, and ossification of tissue. The conversion of AF into chrocy is coincident with upregulated TGF signaling via Smad/3 and BMP induced p38 as well as activation of canonical and non-canonical genes p21 and Ctg. These findings indicate FL is involved in attenuation TGF/BMP signaling and AF fate. The study demonstrates IVD in Fln/- mice resemble degenerative discs, providing insights into molecular causes vertebral and degeneration.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the orthomyxovirus Thog virus (TH) uses to evade the immune system by targeting a general transcription factor called TFI. The virus causes TFI to be relocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, creating a TFI-depleted environment. Although this would be expected to broadly impact gene expression, only a limited number of genes are affected. The study found that TFI is crucial for the recruitment of the polymerase II to promoter sites, but not required for expression from paused promoters. Many immune genes require de novo recruitment of polymerase II, making TH's targeting of TFI a mechanism to affect immune responses while keeping other transcriptional activities intact. Interfering with TFI activity may be a favorable for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation. 

The innate immune system is a network of cytokines and antiviral effector molecules, essential for antiral defense. The study found a mechanism involving viral targeting of single transcription factor TFI, perturbing the immune at a scale with minimal influence on other transcription. Mimicking TH using its inhibitory domain to target TFI, modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules requiring novo recruitment of polymerase without affecting general expression of genes for homeostasis, growth, stability, metabolism, and signaling. Targeting TFI by viruses is beneficial for infection, as pro-inflammatory cytokines required for antiral response are inhibited, while negative regulators and tissue factors are expressed.
Human parvirus B19 (B19) infection of primary erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) induces cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2, containing 4 DNA. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral replication but is dispensable for cycle arrest at G2. A putative C-terminal activation domain (TAD) within NS1 is responsible for G2 arrest. To understand the mechanism of B19 NS-induced G2 arrest, doxycine-inducible B19-permissive UT/E-S cell lines were established that express NS or NSmT2, and the function of T2 during G arrest was examined. Results confirm the NS T2 domain plays a role in NS-induced G arrest Mechanistically, NS activated gene expression through T, which was responsible for ATR (ataxia-telated and Rad-related) activation. Activated A phosphorylated CDC25 at serine, which inactivated cyclin/CDK complex without affecting nuclear import. Importantly, the A-CHK-CDC25-CD1 pathway was activated during B19 infection EPC, and A played a role in BV-induced G arrest. B19 infection induces DDR is essential for DNA replication, although has no effect on cycle at G-phase. The mechanism of B19 NS-induced true G arrest, particularly the role of NS T2 in cell cycle dysregulation, was investigated. B19 NS protein is a factor disrupting cell cycle via T domain, and viral replication DDR not necessary for cycle of cells containing DNA. B-infected cells arrest at S and G contain DNA. Results confirmed A activation plays in G arrest of EPC expressing NS, mediated by T of NS protein, and the A-CHK-CDC-1 pathway activated in cells at G.
Dengue virus (DENV) non-structural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to induce endothelial hyperperability in a mouse and human endothelial cells by disrupting the endothelial glycocalyx layer. This study investigated the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial-intrinsic pathways in this process. In vivo, DENV NS but not West Nile virus NS triggered vascular leak in the dermis of wild-type C57/6 mice. In vitro, human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS did not produce inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8) and blocking these cytokines did not affect DENV-induced endothelial hyperability. Furthermore, DENV induced leak in TLR- or TN- receptor-deficient mice at similar to wild-type levels. Blocking DENV-induced leak in vivo using glycocal disruption inhibitors. These results indicate D NS-induced endothelial-intrinsic vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on glycocal components. This suggests potential targets for therapeutics inhibiting glycocal degradation for severe deng treatment.
In budding yeast, the assembly of a septin ring at the site of bud emergence is crucial for proper cytokinesis, spindle positioning, and the spindle position (SPO) checkpoint, which delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis until the anaphase spindle aligns with the division axis. The PO signalling requires Kin4 kinase and Kin-regulating Elm kinase, which also controls septin dynamics. This study shows that redundant ubiquitin-lases Dma1 and D2 control septin dynamics and PO by promoting efficient recruitment of Elm to the bud. Dma1 D2 mutant cells have reduced Elm at the neck and Elm-dependent Kin4 activation. Artificial recruitment of Elm to the bud neck rescues normal septin ring, spindle positioning, and PO in Dma D2 cells. Data indicate septin and PO function are linked, supporting the idea that bud integrity is crucial for PO signalling. The study also implicates D1 and D2 in septin ring, spindle, cytokinesis, and PO regulation. Constitutive recruitment of Elm at the bud through chimera rescues septin and PO defects in Dma D cells, indicating the defect is due to Elm association with the neck.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide scan to identify genetic adaptations to climate-mediated pressures in humans by analyzing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest correlations to climate variables across 61 worldwide populations. They found a significant enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those strongly correlated with climate variables. Notably, several signals overlapped with those from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. The study also found enrichment of strong signals in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection, and cancer. The results suggest that climate adaptations shaped the spatial distribution of human variation. The analysis detected selective pressures likely mediated by climate, as many signals coincided with SNPs associated with diseases of immune response in GW studies. A subset of SNPs with large effect sizes for climate were strongly associated with traits from GWAS, including pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. The study used allele frequency data from Hancock et al. (2010) to test adaptations to climate at genome-wide level and identified loci underlying adaptations. Genome-wide scans have been conducted in humans, but only two used environmental information to detect selection on a scale. Plots of strongest signals for climate in subsets exhibited patterns restricted to specific regions. Despite smaller populations, a significant enrichment for genic SN with climate relative nonic SN in subsets was found.
A study investigated the arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK)-linked SQT1 variant of short QT syndrome (SQTS), a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Hux (HH) models in reproducing experimental data effects of the N588 mutation on KCNH-encoded hERG channel. Ionic models were incorporated into ventricular action potential (AP) models and 1D and 2D idealized and realistic transmural ventricular simulations and 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588 mutation abbreviated ventricular AP duration at 90% repolarization (AP90) and maximal transm voltage heterogeneity (δ) during AP, resulting in decreased transm heterogeneity AP90 and effective refractory period (ERP). However, with consideration of transm heterogeneity IK density in intact tissue based Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Pfil ventricular model, N588 mutation led to QT shortening and increased T-wave amplitude, but augmented δ in some regions ventricular tissue, increasing vulnerability to uni-directional conduction and reentrant excitation. In 2 and 3D models, N mutation facilitated reentrant excitation due reduced substrate sustaining re-entry size. The study substantiates causal link between N588 mutation QT shortening and increased susceptibility reentrant arrhythm in S1.
Researchers have developed a deep neural network model to study the collective behavior of zebraf, a type of fish, in groups. The model is designed to be both predictive and insightful, meaning it can accurately forecast the motion of individual fish in a group while also providing a clear understanding of the underlying rules governing their behavior. The model is composed of two parts: a pair-interaction network, which describes the interaction between a fish and its closest neighbors, and an aggregation network that combines these interactions to determine the fish's movement. The pair network takes 6 variables as input and outputs 128 values, while the aggregation network reduces this to a single output. The model was trained on simulated data and validated on real trajectories of 60-100 zebraf. The results show that interactions between fish can be described as repulsive, attractive, or aligning, but only at low speeds. At high speeds, interactions are alignment or repulsion at close distances. The model also found that each fish decides where to move by aggregating information from neighbors, with higher weights for those close, in collision, or moving in frontal and lateral locations. The number of interacting individuals is dynamic, typically 8-22, with 1-10 most important. This suggests each fish selects information from the collective dynamically.
Researchers employed a phylogenetic approach to quantify the fitness of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in a Swiss cohort of antiretroviral-naive patients. The study aimed to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance, as around 10% of ART-naive patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV-1. The approach used stochastic birth-death processes to model the transmission of sensitive and resistant strains, allowing the quantification of fitness as the ratio of transmission rates of infected by resistant to sensitive strains. Six mutations in the reverse transcriptase and one in the protease gene were analyzed. The 90 mutation in the protease was found to have higher fitness than sensitive strains, while the reverse transcriptase mutations 67, 70, 184, 219 were less fit than sensitive. The remaining mutations had no significant effect on transmissibility within the cohort. This study presents a novel phylogen approach to estimate transmission cost of resistance, which may be useful in resource-limited settings where resistance testing is possible but epidemiological and clinical data are missing.
A study investigated the role of the Elong complex, specifically the histone acetylase Sin3/El3, in the translation of stress-induced mRNAs in fission yeast. Elong was previously known to interact with RNA polymerase II and be essential for transcription, but also mediates modification of tRNAs, affecting translation efficiency. The study found that Sin/3El3 is crucial for oxidative stress survival, as the transcription program governed by Sty1-Atf1-P1 is affected in mutant cells, but not severely. Cells lacking Sin3/3 cannot modify the uridine wobble nucleotide of certain tRNAs, and other tRNA activities like Ctu-C2 are essential for normal tolerance to H2O. A plasm overexpressing tRNALUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3El3 mutant. The study determined that H2O-dependent genes, including transcription factors At1 and P1, are highly expressed mRNAs with a biased lysine codons. These mRNAs are poorly translated in stress cells lacking Sin3 or C2, whereas mutated At1 with AAG codons is efficiently translated in all backgrounds. The study shows that lack of functional Elong results in stress phenotypes due to tRNA modification and translation inefficiency of stress-induced mRN.
Researchers have discovered a new function of the HIV-1 protein Nef, which makes the virus resistant to two potent neutralizing antibodies, 2F and 4, that target the membrane-proximal region of the envelope protein gp41. This resistance was observed in various HIV-1 and SIV isolates, including CCR5 and CXCR4-tropic viruses, and clade B and C viruses, as well as primary isolates. Analysis of Nef mutants revealed that this activity requires myristoylation, but is separable from other Nef functions such as enhancing infectivity and downregulating CD4. Glycosylated gag substituted for Nef in conferring resistance to 2 and 4, indicating this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode N. N and Glycosylag decreased the efficiency of virion capture by 2 and 4, but not other antibodies. This study demonstrates Nef protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly-acting classes of neutralizing antibodies, with implications for anti-HIV immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated the gene expression changes in the snail host, Bithia siam gomphos, of the liver fluke Opisthoris vivini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma in the Greater Mekong region of Thailand. They used high-throughput Illumina sequencing and bioinformatic analysis to compare the transcriptomes of uninfected and O vivini-infected B siomphos. The study identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune mechanisms against parasites. Protease-encoding genes were downregulated in infected snails, while heat shock proteins and actins were upregulated. This study lays the foundation for understanding genes and products involved in parasite colonization of snail host. The dataset provides a resource for susceptibility and resistance mechanisms of siomphos to vivini and comparative analysis with other snail hosts of platyhelmin, including schistosomes.
Researchers investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1, also known as CD35) in the susceptibility to leprosy, a public health issue in Brazil. They analyzed polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels in a case-control study with 213 lepro patients (47% multibillary) and 297 controls. Nine polymorphisms were hapyped by multiplex PCR-PCR in 213 lepro patients and 297 controls. mRNA levels were measured by qPCR and CR1 by ELISA in 80 samples. Individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs926*T in intron 21 and rs700*T in exon 26 presented twice higher susceptibility to lepro (OR=2.43, p=0.017). Paibillary patients with these variants had lower CR1 levels, reducing anti-inflammatory response (p=0.040 and p=0.046). The most haplotype increased susceptibility to multib clinical form (OR=3.04, p=0.01) and presented intronic rs343*G allele, associated higher gene expression (p=0.043), increasing internalization of parasite. An inverse correlation was found between CR1 and mannose lectin (initiator of lectin pathway complement, recognized by CR) (R=-0.52 p=0.007). The study suggests regulatory role of CR1 polymorph on mRNA and CR1 levels, haplotype effects increasing lepro, probably enhancing phagocytosis and inflammation.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their genetic determinants. They analyzed data from over 3,300 individuals from the KORA3 and K4 cohorts, measuring 131 metabolites including amino acids, phosphatidylchines, sphingomyins, acylcarnines, and C-sugars. Linear regression revealed significant differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites (p-value < 3.8×10^-4, Bonferr-corrected threshold). Genome-wide association studies showed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus (carbamyl-phosphate synthase, significance: p <3.8×10^-10, Bonerr-correct threshold) for glycine. The study found metabolite profiles of males and females are different, and specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism. The study provides new insights into sex-specific regulatory processes and underscores the importance of considering sex-specific effects in study design and interpretation. A meta-analysis of K4 and K3 revealed 113 metabolites with significant sex effect (Bonerr-correct meta-significance: <3.8×10^-4). The study investigated groups of metabolites pairwise correlations, similar effects, and sex-specific propagation through the metabolic network. A partial correlation between metabolites, age, sex, and BMI was calculated. A subpopulation of 180 participants from K4 (Gen-K4) was used to identify genetically determined metabotypes. Replication was done in an independent subsample K4 (Rep4) and subsample K3 (Rep). Sex-strat genome association adjusted for age and BMI was performed for logarithized concentrations all metabolites. Significant effects of gender were found in 102 of 131 metabolites (p below Bonerr-correct significance 3.8×^-4).
Researchers have developed a new method called Minimization of Metabolites (MiBl) to simulate genotype-phenotype relationships in metabolic networks by decoupling stoichiometry from the formulation of objective functions. Current methods use linear combinations of fluxes, which are sensitive to stoichi representation, leading to different results when using numerically equivalent but biochemically equivalent stoichi representations. This makes biological interpretation ambiguous. MiBl uses metabolite turnovers instead of fluxes to formulate objective functions, making results unambiguously linked to biological interpretation. The method was tested on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, expanding the scope of metabolic modeling to elucidate mechanistic basis of genetic interactions. Metabolic networks have a large solution space, requiring optimization approaches to predict active states under specific conditions. The objective function used in optimization is linked to biological hypothesis, making it crucial for successful modeling. A new formulation is proposed to account for stoichi in objective by mapping flux into metabolite space.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the distribution of plague and the genetic structure of the black rat (Rattus rattus), the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. They conducted a comparative study of seroprevalence and genetic (microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four areas with different topography, covering 150-200 km within the Madagas plague focus. Seropreval levels in rat populations mirrored those reported for humans. Rat populations showed a marked genetic structure with increasing relief, but the relationship between seropval data and structure differed, suggesting plague distribution not related to rat dispersal. Genetic estimates suggested plague epizootics had a weak impact on rat population sizes. In highlands, plague cannot be accounted for solely by rat dispersal; human activities may also spread disease in rat and human populations. The study aimed to determine if plague seropval distribution differed between plateau and mountain areas in rats, and if fine-scale genetic structure was higher in mountains than plateaus. Topographic relief influences gene flow in many species, including rodents. The study investigated rat dispersal's role in plague spread by comparing seropval levels and genetic structure in four areas with different topographic profiles.
Researchers investigated the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 (Sm6) family, a group of proteins on the parasite's surface, to understand host-parasite interactions. They identified 11 members, including 3 new ones, and confirmed Sm29 as a unique double PAR/Ly domain-containing protein. Sm6 proteins are likely surface-bound due to cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI sites. Immunoglobulin G (Ig) responses to Sm6 members were studied in a cohort of S mans-infected Ugandan males before and after prazant treatment. Pre-treatment IgG prevalence for Sm6A and SmB was 7.4% and 25.3% respectively, higher than IgG for sub-surface antigen SmAL. Post-treatment IgG levels for SmA and SmB dropped significantly compared to rising Ig for SmAL. This study expands the number of Sm6 proteins and shows SmA and SmB elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the morphology of epithelial tissue in the Drosila retina, focusing on the role of the adhesion protein cadherin. The model minimizes the interfacial energy between cells and reproduces the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, distinguishing features of cadin dynamics, and emphasizes the importance of adhesion proteinogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. The simulations indicate that cadin protein is recycled from inactive to active interfaces, modulating adhesion between cells. 

The model incorporates salient features of morphogenesis, including the timing of cadin expression and its relationship to cell contact remodeling, without additional parameters. It demonstrates that cadher goes beyond cell sorting, determining details of geometric shapes in tissues like the Drosila retina. Experimental data for normal and mutant cells lacking or misexpressing cadin can be explained by the model. The model reproduces characteristic changes in mutants and distinguishes different mechanisms of cadin levels control.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the role of MT-MMP, a protease involved in cancer cell invasion, in degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadodia, specialized membrane protrusions. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments showed rapid recovery of tagged MT-M at invodia, approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants 26 and 259 seconds, primarily dependent on vesicle transport and not lateral diffusion. A computational model based on these kinetics reproduced the FR experiments. Inhibiting vesicle transport blocked ECM degradation and simulations showed no significant degradation. The degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of reduction in MT-M turnover. Simulations suggested synergistic contributions of proteolytic activity and MT-M turnover to ECM degradation, with a nonlinear reduction in degradation when both factors were reduced. The model provides a tool to design intervention strategies for cancer invasion.
Researchers conducted a spatio-temporal assessment of simian/humanodeficiency virus (SHIV) evolution in macaques to understand how drug-resistant HIV-1 arises and spreads within an individual. They infected four macques with RT-SHm027, a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, and treated them with RT inhibitors. Viral DNA and RNA were isolated from blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymph nodes, and vagina at four time points, and characterized via single-genome sequencing. The results show a dynamic process where vRNA rapidly acquires drug resistance across compartments through multiple mutations, with fast migration of viral genotypes across compartments but not immediate equilibration of frequencies. Blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized, while blood and lymph were more different from mucosal tissues. The study suggests that sampled blood does not fully capture viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut, where vRNA turnover was faster and vDNA retained fewer wild-type viruses. The findings of compartmentalization across tissues may explain previous conflicting results in HIV-1 compartmentalization studies.
Feedback regulation of cell lineage progression plays a crucial role in tissue homeostasis, but its role in tissue morphogenesis is unclear. This study uses mathematical modeling to show that feedback in stem and progenitor cells can lead to bistable growth behaviors, ultrasensitivity to external cues, growth-driven budding, self-elongation, and self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise through regulation of cell cycle speeds, not renewal. Spatial patterns result from interactions of diffusible factors with antagonistic effects, but morphogenesis is not Turing-type instability.

 Feedback regulation of stem progenitor renewal leads to bistability and ultras switching between high and low or zero growth states, requiring simultaneous positive and negative feedback. In vivo phenomena include bistability, ultrasensitivity, and feedback-regulated morphogenesis. Positive and negative regulation of renewal by diffus signals leads to emergence of spatial dynamics, manifesting as localized growth differences. Conditions for bistability, ultras, and selforganization are mathematically defined, driving formation of induced or spontaneous bulges and fingers, morphogenesis building blocks. Patterns arise from opposing diffible interactions, not Turing patterns.

Tissue morphogenesis occurs rapidly relative to cell lifespan, final models may represent lineage dynamics during morph, even in self-renew tissues. Feedback in final-state effects are explored.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide association study to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by elongation of the eye, in 45,771 European participants. They analyzed age of onset and identified 22 significant associations, 10 of which replicated earlier associations with refractive error. Ten novel associations replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants who developed myopia before age 10. These associations explain 2.9% of variance in myopia onset and suggest multiple mechanisms behind its development. One association is in PRSS56, linked to abnormally small eyes, one in LAMA, part of extracellular matrix, two in regeneration 11-cis-retinal RGR and RDH, two in growth retinal ganglion cell guidance ZIC and SP1, and five in neuronal development. Findings indicate multiple factors in my development and complex interactions between extracellular remodeling, neuronal, and visual retina signals.
Researchers investigated the role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming using a closed-loop model. The lamprey, like other animals, have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that activates locomotion and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. Feedback is crucial for responding to perturbations, but also active during unperturbed swimming, influencing the baseline pattern. The study evaluated different forms of body-based feedback and their effects on swimming energetics and kinematics, as little is known about curvature feedback form. The CP was modeled as coupled oscillators, pairs representing left and right segments along the lamprey body, activating muscles to move through a simulated fluid using Navier-Stokes model. Emergent curvature served as input to the oscillators, closing the loop. Two feedback forms were considered, consistent with experimental results on lamp proprioceptive receptors. Directional feedback excited or inhibited oscillators on the same side, opposite on the other, affecting duration but not frequency. Magnitude feedback provided a symmetric effect on both sides, increasing frequency and reducing cost when gain was high. Both types resulted in similar curvature magnitude, indicating different forms of feedback can cause distinct performance differences.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of HIV epidemics in populations, focusing on the competition between different strains of the virus. They hypothesized that the strain that first colonizes a population has an advantage over subsequent strains, slowing the spread and diversification of the epidemic. A stochastic modeling framework was developed to simulate epidemics on contact networks, introducing a second strain into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state. Simulations were parameterized with empirical data, testing scenarios with varying prevalence levels. Results showed the second strain spread slower than the first, with a 25% transmission advantage needed to become dominant over decades. Interference mechanisms, such as inhibition, superinfection, and depletion of highly connected nodes, contributed to the effect. Simulations confirmed a first-mover advantage in HIV competition, explaining global phylogeography and influencing pandemic evolution.

A model of sexually transmitted HIV epidemics was developed to monitor competition of strains with varying transmission rates. Without specific conditions, the most transmissible strain drives others extinct, a principle of competitive exclusion. The model was parameterized with data from heterosexual epidemics in Africa, adaptable to other transmission routes and epidemics. Mechanisms can slow invasion, but the pandemic is dynamic, with shifts between lineages occurring. The expansion of HIV-1 at the expense of subtype D in Eastern Africa was used to estimate the required transmission advantage.

A stochastic, individual-based model tracked HIV spread over a network of heterosexual contacts, consisting of males, females, and female sex workers. HIV is transmitted over a limited subset of possible contacts, not a "free mixing". An individual-based simulation tracked dynamic contacts and transmission along network links to detect effects from structure.
Researchers have investigated the self-organization of muscle structure and function at multiple scales, from the sarcomere to the muscle bundle. To address this multiscale problem, they constrained muscle cells in microenvironments that potentiate intracellular organization. They hypothesized that boundary conditions in the extracellular space potentiate the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for sareregenesis. A quantitative model of the cytoskeleton of neonatal ventricular myocytes was developed with respect to geometric cues in the extracellular. Numerical results and in vitro assays showed that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from temporally-ordered processes: interaction between actin fibers, myofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative and parallel bundling of nascent myofils. A hierarchy of mechanisms regulate the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton, and a positive loop is responsible for initiating break symmetry, potentiated by extracellular conditions, to polarize the contractile cytoskeleton.

A computational model recapitulated the protein choreography of sarere assembly, where proteins assemble repetitively along the actin template. Myofils mature in force-dependent, suggesting contractility may play a role in polarizing myofillar network. In nonmuscle cells, cytos architecture becomes polarized with increasing traction forces. A model of myill patterning was developed to show sensitivity of intracellular architecture to extracellular space, to understand assembly and organization of contract apparatus in myocytes.
Researchers investigated the invasive potential of Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacterium being trialed as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission, in Brazilian Aedes aegypt mosquitoes. They characterized the phenotypic effects of the wMel strain in laboratory and found it causes cytoplasmic incompatibility, high maternal transmission rate, and no detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. To understand the effects of urban landscapes on mosquito survival, mark-release experiments were conducted in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolia will be deployed. Mosquito populations were characterized in relation to socio-demographic conditions at these sites and three future release areas. Mathematical models were constructed using laboratory and field data to describe the influence of environmental conditions on the likelihood of Wolia infection reaching 100% following release. Results show the w strain will successfully invade five field sites, with conditions varying greatly between sites and influenced by local mosquito population size. Laboratory and field data indicate the strain possesses characteristics to spread in urban-dem environments, including release sites of the Eliminate Dengue Program. Field sites in Rio are complex, supporting mosquito populations of different sizes, affecting Wolia dynamics, but inter-site differences do not impede overall success. The most influential factor on Wolia spread was local mosquito abundance, with data reinforcing the need to release Wolia-infected mosquitoes in higher sites with larger wild populations.
Researchers have identified a protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses all three forms of histone H3 lysine methylation (H3me) in rice. This epigenetic modification plays a crucial role in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression, and is involved in plant development and stress adaptation. Loss-of-function of the JMJ gene affects stem elongation and growth, possibly due to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of JMJ revealed similarities with mammalian and yeast JM2 proteins, but also showed specific features essential for demethyl activity. Key residues interact with cofactors Fe(II) and N-oxylglycine and methylated H3 peptide were identified. These residues are conserved in known H4 demethylases, suggesting specificity for H4 demylation. J703 is essential for cell division and elongation, and demethylates mono, di, and trimethyl H3 in vivo and in vitro. Demylation of three forms implies J is important for gene expression. Phenotype caused by T-DNA insertion and RNAi increased CK genes suggest J may regulate hormone metabolism, distinct from J14 that functions in floral, DNA methylation, and silencing.
Researchers have identified a shared interface on the HIV-1 capsid protein that is lost upon disassembly, which is targeted by multiple host and pharmacologic ligands. This interface is formed within hexamers, a multi-unit structure of the capsid, and mediates binding to cellular cofactors NUP and CPS6 and antiviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand binds to a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif in the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with BI-2 also interacting across the N-terminal C-terminal (NTD) interface of a second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into monomers prevents high-affinity interaction with CPS6 and PF74 and abolishes binding to N153. The interface is conformationally dynamic, but binding of N153 or CPS6 is accommodated by one conformation. N153 and CPS6 have overlapping sites, but make unique interactions when mutated, perturbing cofactor dependency. The study reveals that multiple ligands share an interface in HIV-1 caps that is lost upon viral disassembly.
Researchers have improved the assembly of the genome of the mosquito Aedes aegypt, a vector of diseases such as dengue and yellow fever and chikunya viruses, by generating a genetic map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were found on the same scaffold. Correcting these errors allowed assignment of 60% of the genome to chromosomes and ordering of scaffolds along chromosomes. Large regions of suppressed recombination were found around centromeres, extending up to 47% of chromosome. The new assembly was used to map a gene making Ae. aegypt resistant to the parasite Brugia malayi and identified candidate genes affecting the trait. The Ae. aegi genome is 1.38 gigabases, organized into 4,758 scaffolds, with 31% preliminarily assigned to chromosomes using physical and genetic markers. Syntenic relationships with Anopheles gambiae chromosomal arms were used to correct the assembly. Chromosomal scaffolds were used to map Ae.egi resistance to filarial nematode B. The genome organization of the host is essential to identify genetic components of vector competence. The Ae.egi and Cule quinqueascatus genomes are highly fragmented, with large scaffolds not ordered and oriented. The new assembly facilitates mapping of genes affecting disease transmission. A resistant and susceptible strains were crossed, backcrossed, and progeny fed infected and dissected to examine worm development.
Aedes aegyti, the primary vector of deng and yellow fever viruses, is a key target for vector control programs in tropical countries. Traditional larval surveys are still widely used despite the availability of new trapping devices. This study compared entomological indices generated by larval surveys and four alternative traps (BG-Sent, Adultrap, MosquiAP, and ovitrap) in terms of sensitivity to detect mosquito density variation. The study was conducted in five cities representing tropical climate variations. Simultaneously, lar surveys were performed. Positivity and density indices were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to characterize seasonal patterns of infestation. The House Index was low in most cities, with median 0, while traps produced indices, indicating greater sensitivity to Ae.egti presence than lar surveys. Positivity and density agreed on seasonality in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature, not precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation. All traps performed better than the Index in measuring seasonal abundance and should be considered complements or alternatives to lar surveys. Traps should consider differences in cost and ease-of-use.
Human cytidine deaminase APOECG3 (AG) is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements, capable of deaminating cytidines to urines in single-stranded DNA intermediates. The protein contains two cytidine deamin domains (CDAs), with only the C-terminal one known to mediate deamination. Using the crystal structure of tetrameric APOEC2, residues in AG were identified to mediate oligomerization. Yeast two-hybrid assays, coimmunprecipitation, and crosslinking showed tyrosine-124 and tryptan-127 in the enzymatically inactive N-terminal CDA mediate AG oligomer, coinciding with packaging into HIV-1 virions. Oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Homology of AG onto A2 structure indicates accumulation of positive charge in a putative dimer interface. Substitution arginine residues 24, 30, and 136 in this pocket resulted reduced virus, virion, and oligomer. Consistent with RNA central role, oligomer-deficient AG associated less with cellular molecules. We propose occupation positively pocket by RNA promotes oligomer, packaging virions, and antiral function.
Researchers have identified the genetic factors contributing to a major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) in Drosophila melanogaster, specifically the bric-br locus, which affects cuticular pigmentation. By leveraging the species' high sequence variation and low linkage disequilibrium, they dissected the effects of causative variants within a single locus. Polymorphisms near regulatory elements, including a promoter, tissue-specific enhancer, and Polycomb response element, cumulatively impact bric-br alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation. Analysis of allele-specific expression at the br-br locus confirms these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level. This study demonstrates a QTL can act through multiple mechanisms, with sequence variation in flanking experimentally validated elements having significant effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. The findings have implications for both basic and medical genomics.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a persistent cause of invasive mucosal disease in humans, has adapted to widespread antibiotic and vaccine use through genetic adaptation. This adaptation is facilitated by the uptake and incorporation of new genetic material from the surrounding microbial community, controlled by a regulated quorum sensing system triggered by extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP). This study demonstrates CSP stimulates production of diverse bacteriocins through increased secretion of bacterioc pherone BlC and requires a functional competence system. A conserved motif in the promoter of BlC operon mediates upregulation by CSP. Accumulation of BlC results in activation of Bl locus. Using biofilm organisms as a model for competition and genetic exchange on mucosal surface, DNA exchange is enhanced by bacterin secretion, suggesting co-stimulation of bacterins provides an adaptive advantage. Bl and regulatory pathways diverged in a pneumoccus ancestor, yet maintained connection promotes competition and adaptation by targeting a wide range of competitors while providing incorporation DNA. The competence system is controlled by quorum sensing regulated by extracellular CSP. Dedicated transporter ComAB processes and secretes CSP. Amino acid sequence preceding mature CSP is recognized by Com and cleaved at double glycine while peptide transported out. Strains with disrupted BlA demonstrate activation bacterin with competence, but Bl pherone secreted ComAB only during competence. Bacterin increases efficiency in dual biofilms suggesting liberation through pneumin contributes adaptability.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular protein SR20 (SRp20) in poliovirus infection, specifically its localization and interaction with protein PC2 (PC2) in recruiting ribosomes to the viral RNA for translation. In poliovirus-infected neuroblastoma cells, SR20 localized from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it partially co-localized with PC2, corroborating previous in vitro data. SR20 was associated with PC2 bound to polirus RNA, indicating interaction on the viral RNA. A mutated SR20 lacking the RNA recognition motif (SR20ΔM) localized similarly and co-localized with PC2, but expression resulted in a 100-fold decrease in polirus yield, suggesting a dominant-negative effect. Co-sedation of SR20 and PC2 with 40S ribosomal subunits in poliov-infected cells suggests they function in translation complex formation for polirus IRES translation. Studies provide evidence for PC2-SR20 interaction in cells during polirus and a model where PC2 bound to viral RNA interacts with SR20 to recruit translation complex to RNA, possibly with additional protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions.
Researchers conducted an ENU mutagenesis screen to identify genes regulating neural crest (NC) development, a population of embryonic cells giving rise to glia, neurons, and melanocytes. They used a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10ac/+, and analyzed 71 pedigrees, identifying four heritable loci, modifier of Sox expression 1-4 (m1-4), altering NC patterning. In homozygous m1 embryos, Sox10ac expression was absent in cranial ganglia, nerves, and sympathetic chain, but other Sox-expressing cells unaffected. Linkage analysis, sequencing, and complement testing confirmed m1 as a new allele of receptor tyrosine kinase Erb3, Erb3m1, with a single amino acid substitution in extracellular region. The E-induced mutation did not alter protein expression, but impaired ER3 signaling, causing embryonic defects in m1 resembling Er3 null alleles. Biochemical analysis showed ER3 expressed on surface, but ligand phosphorylation reduced by m mutation, highlighting importance of residue for ER3 function. This study demonstrates utility of E mutesis in identifying pathways regulating NC and dissecting protein domains contributing to gene function in development.
Researchers conducted a study in a Ugandan community to investigate factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection, a parasitic flatworm causing schistosomiasis. They examined the impact of age, sex, and ethnicity on susceptibility to reinfection after antiparasitic treatment, using individual cercarial exposure scores to account for environmental and behavioral heterogeneities. The study found ethnic and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to cercarial exposure, not biological differences in susceptibility. Age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure, but linked to IgE and IgG responses to tegument antigen SmAL (Sm22.6), associated with resistance to reinfection. The study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in complex settings to understand population ecology and draw robust conclusions. 

The study used data from a multidisciplinary reinfection study in a Ugandan fishing community highly endemic for schosomiasis to investigate S. mansoni rein. Individual cercarial exposure scores were used to adjust for variations in exposure, supported by epidemiological studies on exposure and reinfection patterns in schosias-endemic communities. Genetic studies identified genes associated with susceptibility or immunity to infection. Microepidemiological studies on Schos infection are limited by lack of individual cercarial exposure data, using proxy markers such as distance to infective water may not accurately reflect exposure. The study found age-infection profiles typical of schos-endemic communities, infection greatest in children, lower in adults. Exposure scores investigated roles of age and sex in susceptibility, Alur ethnic group speculated more susceptible. Schosome Ig or Ig4 immune responses accounted for remaining susceptibility variation.
A study investigated the correlation between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and the worm burden of Clonorchis sinensis in humans. A total of 60 residents, 50 egg-positive and 10-negative, in Sanche-gun, Korea, participated in the study from 2006-2009. They were diagnosed by egg positivity in feces using the Kato-K method. After administration of prazantel, they were purged with cathartics the next day, and discharged worms were collected from feces. EPG ranged from 0 to 65,544. Adult C. sin were collected from 17-positive, and the number ranged from 1 to 114 each. A correlation between EPG and numbers was demonstrated (r= 0.681, P<0.001). Recovery rates were 9.7% in EPG 1-1,000 and 73.7% in EPG over 1,000. No worms were detected from egg-negative. Maximum count per worm per day was estimated 3,770 in subject EPG 2,664 and collected. The numbers of worms were significantly correlated with egg in Cloniasis. It estimated at least 110 worms in human with EPG around 3,000 and productivity a worm per day around 4,000.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to combat the growing concern of antifungal drug resistance by harnessing synthetic lethal interactions in a model organism. They conducted an unbiased genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a Candida glata P1 gain-of-function allele, which is a mediator of fluconazole resistance in the human pathogen. Eighteen synthetically lethal S cerevisiae genetic mutants were identified, one of which was histone acetylase G5. Deletion or drug inhibition of G5 caused a lethal phenotype in C glata expressing P1 alleles and inhibited the emergence of fluazole-resistant glata isolates in evolution. The study provides proof of concept that synthetically genetic screens can identify novel proteins therapeutically targeted to treat drug-resistant infections. The researchers confirmed the lethal interaction between G5 and P1 in C glata by inducing P1L280 in a glata g5 null mutant, resulting in loss of viability. Chemical inhibition of G5 also rendered both species inviable, supporting the proposition that targeting synthetic interactions offers a new treatment paradigm for resistant infections. The study demonstrated that targeting G5, a synthetically interacting partner of P1 identified in cerevis, renders both species and ortholog glata inviable. Additionally, the emergence of gain function in P1 was prevented in glata g5 mutants in the presence of fluazole.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4) during poliovirus (PV) infection to understand its role in genome replication and assembly. They used two mutants, EG and GG, with aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, which delays genome replication and assembly, to study the pathway of PV-induced membranous structures. PV changes in the PI pool were observed as early as 30 minutes post-infection, and remodeling occurred in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor, accompanied by membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicles appeared in the perinuclear region at 3 hours post-infection, too late for replication. Delays in onset replication for EG and GG were similar to delays in PI remodeling, suggesting PI serves as a genome-replication organel marker. GG was unable to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicles, explaining nearly 5-log reduction in virus production. Results indicate PV induces distinct membrous structures for replication (tubules) and assembly (vesicles). The pace, spatiemporal dynamics, and efficiency of replication-to-assembly organel conversion may be set by P3 processing rate and capacity to yield 3 and 3 proteins.
Researchers developed a multi-step strategy to identify new compounds with trypanocidal activity against Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. They used virtual screening of the ZINC database, a collection of commercially available compounds, followed by enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography, and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. From 23 selected compounds, 12 non-peptide, non-covalent cruzain inhibitors with low micromolar affinity (3-60µM) were identified, acting through competitive inhibition. The binding mode of cruzain inhibitor Neimed176 was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Cruzain, a validated target for chemotherapy, shares similarity with mammalian cathepsin L, linked to invasive properties and metastatic cancer. Inhibitors from the library were assayed against catheps L, showing similar affinity (4-80µM) and poor selectivity towards cruzain, raising possibility of investigating their effect on cell proliferation. The most potent cruzain inhibitors were tested against T. cruzi-infected cells, two showing trypanidal activity. Compound Neimed42 was used to establish SAR, identifying the 2-acetamthiophene-3-carbox group essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition. The IC50 for Neimed against T. cruzi trypomastote was 10.6±0.1µM, tenfold lower than benznidazole, a positive control. A smaller compound, Neimed, with lig efficiency 0.33kcal/mol-atom-1, was highlighted as a non-peptide, nonvalent cruzain trypanidal candidate for optimization.
Researchers have developed two non-viral DNA-based vaccine formulations to protect against yellow fever, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions. The formulations encode the full-length envelope protein of the yellow fever virus (YF) or the envelope protein fused with lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (L). The vaccines were tested in mice strains C57/6 and BAL/c, corresponding to C57/6 and BAL/c mice, respectively. Both induced strong T-cell responses against all epitopes generated by the YF17 vaccine, with pLFE performing best. Additionally, pFE stimulated high titers of anti-Y neutralizing antibodies comparable to those elicited by the 17 vaccine. Importantly, pFE conferred 100% protection against Y virus in intracereally challenged mice. These results indicate pFE is an excellent candidate for further development. 

The study characterized T and humoral responses to the envelope of Y in C57/6 and BAL mice immunized with DNA expressing the full-length F protein, either wild-type or fused L. Responses were compared to the standard immunization using Y17. The ability of vaccines to provide protection against lethal challenge was also evaluated. An optimized Y17 immunization protocol and IF-gamma ELISA conditions were used to characterize T responses to peptides of Y proteins in C57/6 mice. Total splenocytes identified 11 antigenic peptides from the F protein. Immunization with DNA expressing the envelope resulted in recognition of three peptides not produced by Y17. T response to E169 generated by pFE and pLFE was significant, and to E413 and E431 higher in immunized pFE than pFE. Although Y17 produced higher neutralizing titers, DNA encoding entire protein also protected mice against challenge.
Researchers have identified the nucleoid protein SlmA as a direct transcriptional activator of chitio utilization in Vibrio cholera, a pathogen that requires chitin for persistence and horizontal gene transfer in the marine environment. The ch operon, responsible for chitin uptake and degradation, is regulated by the sensor kinase ChiS, but the downstream mechanisms of Chi activation were unclear. An unbiased transposon screen revealed SlmA as a regulator of the ch operon, a novel role for a TetR family protein, typically transcriptional repressors. In vitro, SlmA binds directly to the oper promoter, and in vivo, this interaction is required for transcriptional activation and chio utilization. Mutations disrupting SlmA functions show DNA binding, not nucleoidation, is critical for transcription activation. This study identifies SlmA as a transcriptional regulator in V cholera, in addition to its established role as a cell licensing factor.
Researchers have developed a scalable nonlinear programming framework for solving parameter estimation problems in dynamic biological systems, which are computationally challenging due to highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations, many parameters, and experimental data sets. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools that are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. It employs a time-discretization approach that avoids repetitive model simulations, enables algebraic model computation of derivatives, and uses computationally efficient nonlinear point solvers that exploit sparse and structured algebra. The framework is demonstrated by solving synthetic gut microbiome models with 156 parameters, 144 equations, and 1,704 data points in under 3 minutes, while an off-the-shelf solution requires 7 hours. Large instances show the framework can solve up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 equations, and 20,352 points in 15 minutes. The framework is flexible, easy-to-use, and can be applied to dynamic biological systems, enabling estimation, uncertainty quantification, observability analysis, model selection, and outlier handling.
Researchers used the nCounter, a high-throughput digital gene expression system, to study the inflammatory response to West Nile virus (WNV) in the Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model. The study aimed to understand gene expression changes following infection and viral dissemination. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with NV and tissues (spleen, lung, liver, and brain) analyzed over nine days. The nCounter Inflammation gene kit, containing 179 inflammation-related genes, was used to analyze expression changes. Protein levels of cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using multiplex detection (Biolex) and compared to RNA levels. Results showed Ccl and Ilb were differentially expressed in all tissues except kidney. Stratification of infected (NV+) versus non-infected (-) tissues allowed differentiation of systemic gene response from tissue-specific responses. Significant decrease in C1 was found in (-) spleen, while Il was upregulated, Il downregulated in (-) lung, and M2 downregulated in (-) liver. In (+) livers, Stat, T2, chemok Ccl, C, C, C, C, Il, Il, Il, and Il were upregulated. In (-) tissues, C and C were upregulated. Gene and protein kinetics for C, C, C, C, and C correlated with virus presence. The study demonstrated the utility of nCounter for rapid identification of gene changes in mice associated with NV infection.
An outbreak of rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique in 2014, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human and animal bites. Between April and August 2014, 14 cases of human rabies were detected, all with a history of recent dog bites, and only one of the 14 rabid dogs was immunized. 819 animal bites were registered, with 64.6% from Maputo City, and dogs responsible for 97.8% of bites, but only 27% were immunized. Factors associated with human rabies were age <15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite to head, by unimmun dog, no soap use, and no post-exposure prophylaxis.

The study aimed to determine clinical and epidemiological features of human rab cases, risk for developing rab, and animal bites in Map and Matola. The findings will contribute to formulating strategies to control rab in Mozambique. This is the first investigation of rab outbreak and epidemiology of bites in Mozambique, where procedures are irregular, resulting in frequent outbreaks. Maputo City health authorities alerted a possible outbreak in July 2014, with several patients admitted with rab in a short time. Reliable data on rab burden and factors is a challenge for policies and strategies, a major cause for underinvestment in control.

Demographic and risk factors were compared between animal bites and human rab to determine predictive variables. Age <15 (OR:4.8, p=0.05), bite stray (OR:13.6, p=0.002), deep wound (p=0.02), head (p=0.001), unimmun (p=0.01), no soap (p=0.001), and postexposure (p=0.01) were associated.
Researchers identified a new gene, SCN9, encoding the Nav1.7 sodium channel, as a cause of febrile seizures (FS) in a large family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q. A mutation in a conserved amino acid, p.N641, in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II was found in 21 affected members, but not in ethnically matched controls. To establish a functional role, the mutation was introduced into the murine Sc9 ortholog using homologous recombination. Compared to wild-type, homozygous Sc9/N mice exhibited reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and increased kindling acquisition rates. This supports SCN9 as disease-causing in the family. SCN was also analyzed in 92 unrelated FS patients, finding highly conserved Nav.7 missense variants in 5%. One child with FS later developed Drav syndrome, a severe myoclonic epilepsy, and SCN1 was sequenced, revealing a heterozygous frameshift. Analysis of 109 Drav patients yielded 9 Nav.7 missense variants, 8%, in conserved amino acids. Six Drav patients with SCN miss variants had either miss or splice SCN1 mutations or no SCN mutations. This study provides evidence for SCN in human epileps, both as cause and partner SCN mutations.
Researchers have proposed a new framework, called the Polarised Tissue (PT) framework, to explain how complex tissue shapes arise through growth. The PT framework views tissue as a continuous material where regional factors under genetic control interact and propagate polarity. Polarity is established through signals that anchor in regions termed tissue organisers, also under genetic control. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to polarity are specified through a regulatory network. Growth depends on specified patterns within tissue constraints, leading to features like curvature not specified by networks. Resulting growth influences spatial arrangements and orientations, allowing complex shapes to emerge from simple rules. Asymmetries emerge through polarity interactions. The PT framework was applied to a growing Snapdragon flower, illustrating how hypotheses can be tested by simulation. Combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth, a feature of polarity systems, have been exploited to generate observed shapes.

A series of models studied interactions between tissue polarity and growth in shape generation. Each model had a phase with initial shape and distribution of identities and signalling factors, and components. Simplified models illustrated growth and polarity combinator during morphogenesis generating forms. Results highlighted specifying orientations independently of stresses in complex shapes. Theoretical foundations for modelling were provided. The polarity system accounted for global changes, growth patterns, and clones without large polarity organisers, demonstrating its validity.

In 2D, deformations were considered. A feature of polarity is orientation and growth can be specified and combined. Combinatorially, unlike stress system where orientations depend on stresses. Shapes reflect interactions, growth, and mechanical constraints. Depending on organisers and polarity dynamics, tissue can reinforce or antagonise curvatures or generate curvature in uniform growth. Combinatorial interactions within the plane were considered.
Researchers investigated the consequences of interference between multiple CD8+ T cell escape mutations in early HIV infection. During HIV infection, CD8+ T cell responses are elicited simultaneously, exerting selective pressure on different parts of the virus's genome, leading to mutations that escape recognition and are beneficial to the virus. Some studies show that later escape mutations emerge, the slower they go to fixation. This pattern of escape rate decrease (ER) can arise from distinct mechanisms, particularly in populations with high mutation rates among escape strains, resulting in delayed fixation times of beneficial mutations compared to sexual reproduction. The study developed a multi-locus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination as a null model for interference, and an interference-free model assuming neutral evolution before immune response. Interference between equally advantageous mutations generated the ER pattern. The number of loci and recombination rates affected ER, explained by exponential decline of escape rates over time. ER in HIV individuals is consistent with both interference-free and interference effects. Results confirm interference should be considered when analyzing escape mutations. Estimation of escape and selective coefficients by interference cannot be overcome by sampling sizes due to fundamental shortcomings of current techniques under interference regimes.
Researchers developed a mechanistic model to estimate the in vivo efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) patients. The model incorporates cancer cell proliferation, heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance mechanisms. It uses tumor volumetric data from two time points before and during treatment, accounting for tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation effects. Sensitivity analysis identified growth rate and fraction as key features for accurate estimates. The model was applied to 13 NSCL patients receiving cisplatin with gemcitab, vinlb, or docetax in neoadjuvant context. Input values were guided by literature on cancer kinetics. Latin hyper sampling compensated for patient uncertainties. The study provides a framework for estimating in vivo cell killing of chemotherapies, correlating estimates with patient molecular profiles for personalized predictions.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance in bacterial biofilms, specifically focusing on the fluoroquinoloneloxacin, a type of antibiotic. They used transposon mutagenesis to identify mutants in Escherichia coli that formed biofilms with increased tolerance to the antibiotic. The study found that biofilms formed by amino acid auxotrophic mutants exhibited higher tolerance to fluoroquinoloxacin than their planktonic counterparts. Amino acid starvation was shown to significantly increase biofilm tolerance to the antibiotic. Biofilm heterogeneity creates specialized niches where bacteria respond to local cues, leading to genetically and metabolically distinct subpopulations with high tolerance to extracellular stresses like antibiotics. The researchers isolated mutants with decreased ability to form biofilms and found that biofilms formed by amino auxotrophic mutants displayed high antibiotic tolerance. They demonstrated that amino acid starvation increased antibiotic tolerance in biofilm bacteria. Biofilm tolerance to fluoroquinoloxacin was dependent on the SOS response to amino and carbon source, and partially on the stringent response to leucine starvation. However, bio-specific tolerance did not involve SOS-induced toxin-antitoxin systems associated with highly tolerant persisters. Bio tolerance was induced as a function of biofilm age, dependent on SOS response. The study shows that SOS response in nutrient-deprived biofilm environments is a mechanism for bio-specific tolerance to fluoroquinoloxacin.
Researchers have identified cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a key regulator of Plasium falcumeroite invasion of human erythrocytes, a critical step in the development of malaria. Invasion of erythrocytes by P. falcumeroites requires specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands localized in apical organelles called micronemes. The study found that exposure of meroites to a low potassium environment, typical of blood plasma, activates a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adeny cyclase, raising cytosolic c levels and activating protein kinase, which regulates micron secretion. Additionally, c regulates meroite cytosolic calcium levels via an Ep pathway and increases in both c and Ca are essential to trigger micron secretion. The identification of elements in c-dependent pathways regulating micron secretion during invasion provides targets to inhibit blood parasite growth and prevent malaria.
Strongyloides stercis, a soil-transmitted nematode, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). A review of 20 years of studies on S. stercis global prevalence in populations and risk groups was conducted. A literature search of PubMed articles from 1989 to 2011 was performed, including studies on infection prevalence. Bayesian analysis was carried out to obtain country-specific estimates and compare disease ratios in risk groups, accounting for diagnostic sensitivities. 354 studies from 78 countries were included, with 62.4% community-based, 34.2% hospital-based, and 11% refugee/immigrant studies. World maps with country data are provided. African, Asian, and South American resource-poor countries lack S.ercis information. Meta-analysis showed association between HIV/alcoholism and Sercis (OR 2.17, CI 1.18-4.01; OR 6.69 CI 1.47-3.8). High prevalence in selected countries and regions, Sercis prominent in risk groups. Adequate information lacking from many countries, underscoring Serc not to be neglected. Further socio-economic and ecological assessments and integration into global health warranted.

The study aimed to obtain country-wide Serc infection risk and assess association with risk groups. High rates in South Asia, refugees, and immigrants reported. In developed countries, strongyloidis an issue for immigrants, tourists, and military returning from endemic areas. This has implications for medical services and systematic screening before immunosuppressive treatment. Serc infection rates patchy, incidence non-existent. Strongloides stercis world-wide, excluding north, south, prevalence estimates often guesses. Data required for countries, socio-cultural settings. Large-scale population surveys, sensitive methods would narrow gap. Comprehensive collection global Serc rates, information missed due to language, databases.
Researchers have investigated the role of stochastic noise in circadian rhythms, specifically how it affects the entrainment of cells to external cues and generation of autonomous rhythms. However, few studies have examined the impact of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise due to the difficulty in measuring single-cell noise. This study demonstrates that population-level bioluminescence damping can serve as an accurate measure of stochastic noise, applicable to high-throughput circadian screens. Using fibroblast data, higher single-cell noise results in faster population damping, and small molecule modulators change damping in a dose-dependent manner, explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. The method was applied to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing stochastic altered independently of period and phase. The unperturbed clock is optimized for robust rhythms, few perturbations increasing amplitude and lowering noise. This study highlights the importance of considering circadian perturbations on stochastic, particularly for small-molecule circadian therapeutics development.
Researchers have identified the bacterial protein Fts as a promising target for developing new antibiotics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The protein FZ is essential for bacterial cell division, and an allosteric inhibitor, PC723, has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus. However, the mechanism of action and effect on FZ in other species is unclear. This study examined the structural environment of the PC723 binding pocket using Pocket, a method that scores similarity between small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure and molecular dynamics simulations. Results show species and nucleotide state significantly impact the binding site, with disparate environments for non-Staphlococcus species. Pocket analysis of S aureus FZ bound to GTP with resistance mutations predict PC723 strongly binds Staphlocus in nucleotide state. Simulations of FZ dimer indicate polymerization enhances PC723 binding. The study demonstrates the drug pocket can vary across species, genetic variations, and polymer states, providing information for FZ inhibitor development.
Researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains (NTD and CCD) of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in complex with the binding domain (IBD) of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), a protein essential for lentiviral replication. The structure reveals charge interactions between the NTD of IN and IBD, including a constellation of acidic residues on NTD characteristic of lentiviral IN and positively charged residues on IBD. These contacts are critical for stimulating lentiral DNA integration by LED in vitro and during early steps of HIV-1 replication. The findings enabled engineering of a mutant HIV-1 IN that functions only with a complementary LEDGF mutant, providing a basis for lentiral IN-LED interaction and paving the way for LED-based therapies. Deletion of HIV-1 NTD or mutation destabilizing zinc within this domain reduced interaction with LED. A homolog LED, hepatoma growth-related protein 2 (HRP2), interacts with HIV-1 IN and stimulates enzymatic activity in vitro, but its role in lentiral integration is unclear. Lentiral IN is a tetramer and a tetramer model proposed for apoenzyme based on two-domain HIV-1 IN structure. Lentiral integration depends on LED, which associates with chromatin and regulates gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and apoptosis. LED binds lentiral to chromatin in nucleus and directs PIC to active genes during integration.
Researchers investigated the evolution and phenotypic selection of cancer cells in relation to tumor progression. They found that cells from different organs have intrinsic kinetics that influence their behavior, which are inherited by cancer cells and determine initial tumor dynamics. Genetic and epigenetic alterations can change these kinetics, leading to favorable alterations that increase fitness and accelerate progression. A cellular automaton model was developed to track the evolution of cancer stem cells, which can initiate and sustain tumors. Traits such as migration, spontaneous death due to genetic mutations, symmetric division, and telomere length were explored. The study suggests proliferation is the strongest modulator of growth, with increased potential yielding more non-stem cells that compete with stem cells, while reduced potential loosens inhibition and facilitates stem division. The stem cell population becomes heterogeneous, varying from dormancy to progression. Clonal diversity in single biopsies represents a small proportion of total phenotypes.
Researchers investigated the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, focusing on the role of spatial heterogeneity in the human population. They used mathematical models to describe adaptation scenarios with reference to spatial heterogeneity and derived analytical expressions for the probability of emergence, waiting time to emergence, and outbreak size distribution. The study found that for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak distribution and risk of emergence. For example, a village connected to a city by 10 commuters a day is effectively part of the city in terms of emergence and outbreak distribution. Empirical data showed most communities are at least this interconnected. For plausible ranges, effects of heterogeneity are dominated by host biology adaptation. The study suggests only remote communities are subject to epidemiological isolation. Factors like human patterns and host heterogeneity also shape risk and speed of emergence. The research focused on spatial structure of the host population, which has received little attention in adapting pathogens. The modelled spatially separated communities with varying connections, such as a village and city. The biology of the pathogen determines emergence and outbreak sizes according to reproductive number. The effective village size is due to absent commuters. A threshold exists where heterogeneity does not matter. Previous research depends on interconnectivity allowing spread between communities. The approach allows insights without specifying infectious hosts migrating. Analytical results were validated with stochastic simulations of village-city models.
Researchers analyzed genomic data from 287 avian influenza A virus (AIV) samples collected over a 34-year period of continuous surveillance in North American migratory birds. They used a Bayesian framework to test hypotheses of viral migration, population structure, and genetic reassortment patterns. Results showed that Charadriiform birds in Delaware did not significantly contribute to North American IV diversity, while Anseriform in Alberta represented AIV diversity. IV may be restricted to short-term migratory flyways, but long-term persistence was independent of flyways between populations. Analysis of long-term data provides insights for predictive models for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection. Avian viruses were isolated annually in Alberta and Delaware, with 287 genomes sequenced. Full genome data characterized reassment, spatial patterns, and evolutionary genomics of IV in America over 25 years from migratory birds. Methodological advances enabled large-scale assessment of spatiotemporal viral movement between bird populations. 20 regions in North America were identified where viruses were collected from wild birds to determine population structure according to migratory fly and rates of gene flow between populations. The goal was to understand migration and diffusion of IV in natural hosts using 30 years of surveillance. Results showed that Alberta, with convergence of four migratory fly, captured majority of North genetic diversity. Breeding birds in this region facilitated spread and generation of virus diversity, indicating importance of Anseres social behavior in persistence. Delaware was identified as hotspot for AIV, where thousands of Charadiform stop to feed in dense congregations. Long-term persistence of IV in wild may be independent of migratory fly.
Researchers have developed a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S/1391, that targets a common antigen site on the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A viruses. This antibody shows heterosubic cross-reactivity, meaning it can neutralize and inhibit multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13. MAb S/1 was found to be effective against particular strains of H, H, H, and H subtypes of influenza viruses. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb/1 were analyzed and found to have amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193 of the HA gene. Molecular modeling revealed these amino acids are located on the globular head of HA and form a conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain. Passive immunization of mice with MAb/1 provided heterosubic protection. The study demonstrates M/1 binds to a shared antigenic site among various HA subtypes and neutralizes infectivity in vitro and in vivo by affecting viral attachment to cells. This supports the notion that cross-reactive antibodies play a role in heterosubic immunity against influenza virus infection and highlights the potential utility of cross-reactive antibodies in therapy.
A three-year cohort study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment on Strongyloides steralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population and the validity of using a lower ELISA cut-off for diagnosis. Two hundred and fifty-nine adults living in a remote community in northern Australia were tested for S. stercis using a commercial ELISA kit with a lower threshold than recommended. Follow-up was conducted at 6 months and 3 years after ivermect treatment. Results showed a significant decrease in prevalence from 35.3% to 5.8% (McNem's chi2 = 56.5, p<0.001). The use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was deemed valid in this setting. Follow-up identified a small group with persistently positive ELISA serology despite treatment. Control of S. stis in this cohort appears feasible through pharmacological treatment alone. Three years after treatment, prevalence fell to 1.4%. This study provides evidence that control of chronic S. stis in an Aboriginal population can be achieved through case-finding and treatment using current guidelines.
Researchers investigated whether long-incubation period prion strains can interfere with each other when co-infected in animals. They found that co-infection of long-incation strains did not show evidence of interference, suggesting that the lack of interference is not due to failure to target the same cells but an inherent property of the strains. Protein misfolding cyclic amplification assays (PMCA) indicated that both strains amplified independently, consistent with animal bioassay studies. Importantly, PMCA reactions seeded with longation strains contained relatively higher levels of PrC compared to seeded with shortation strain. This suggests that abundance of Pr is not limiting in vivo or in vitro in pr strains with low conversion efficiency to amplify independently. This changes the paradigm of prion strain interactions and has implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of pr strains from mixture. Pr strain interference occurs when Pr abundance is limiting, and strains compete for Pr, which is necessary for prion formation. Overexpression of Pr can lead to emergence of strains not identified when Pr is at physiological levels. The study suggests that subset of Pr convertible by both strains may influence interference more than total Pr abundance.
Researchers have proposed a comprehensive model to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in alloster regulation, challenging the previous assumption that intrinsic disorder is favorable for alloster coupling. The model reveals that the Monod-Wy-Wyman-Change (MWC) pathway, which involves order-to-disorder transition, has a higher probability of alloster effect than the Ensemble Allost Model (EAM) pathway, which involves disorder-to-order transition. This suggests a more complex role of intrinsically disordered protein regions (ID/IDRs) in regulatory proteins. An analytical formula for maximal alloster coupling shows that stable or unstable states are unfavorable for alloster, aiding in designing alloster drugs. The Ensemble Allost Model (EAM) previously explained the prevalence of ID/ID in alloster regulation by high alloster intensity and probability of disordered states. However, it lacks the order-to-disorder transition, present in the MWC model for ordered proteins. A comprehensive model considering both transitions shows order-disorder (E) is less competitive than order-order (M) in affording alloster, especially strong alloster. The prevalence of ID/ID in alloster regulation is more complicated than thought. The model does not provide a complete answer, but offers discussion. ID/ID alloster effect without ordered structures is related to a new view of alloster based on protein structure landscape, where ligand stabilizes states and shifts conformation. The EAM used this view to explain ID alloster. The prevalence of ID/ID in alloster is determined by advantage, not only alloster capacity. Combining experimental and bioinformatics would compare ordered and dis importance in alloster.
β-Caten plays a crucial role in prostate development and cooperates with PTEN loss to drive invasive carcinoma. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of death in Western countries, but few genetic alterations driving prostate initiation and progression have been identified. β-Caten is essential for developmental processes and implicated in tumorigenesis in many tissues, including prostate. However, studies on human cancer samples are unclear on this protein's role. In vivo studies in embryo and adult extended understanding βaten's role in normal and neoplastic prostate. Gene deletion revealed prostate epithelial βaten required for embryonic growth but dispensable in adult. During development, βaten controls progenitors in epithelial buds and regulates discrete genes, c-Myc and Nk3.1. Deletion βaten in PTEN model castration cancer demonstrated dispensable for progression. Complementary overexpression, in vivo stabilization showed βaten promotes squamous epith during development absence androgens. βaten overexpression with PT loss drove invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplas. These demonstrate βaten essential for prostate and inherent high levels drive squamous differentiation.
Researchers conducted a study to understand the factors influencing informed consent in a biomedical study in a low-income setting, specifically in southern Ethiopia, among people with podoiosis (non-filar elephantiasis). They adapted a rapid assessment method validated in The Gambia. The study was qualitative, involving focus groups and in-depth interviews with podoiosis patients, non-patients, community workers, researchers, NGO staff, and community leaders. Results showed that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and information presentation techniques impacted comprehension. Approaching patients via trusted individuals and preceding community sensitization were optimal communication means. Poverty, absence of treatment facilities, and trust in NGO were barriers to genuine consent. Researchers should evaluate consent processes to provide information in a comprehensible manner and support decision-making on a study-by-study basis.

The community believed podoiosis is genetic, using terms like 'passed from parents and grandparents' and 'blood' to express disease. Most participants did not favor written consent forms. Fieldworkers and researchers suggested monetary compensation might induce participation due to poverty, stressing 'kel yoneiminet' (voluntariness) should be part of the process. Participants advised approaching patients through local intermediaries like MPA fieldworkers, as they are respected. Local gatherings, group discussions are usual information modes. Important ethical guidelines: research purpose, researchers, affiliations, biological sample, confidentiality, and findings were considered in the consent process.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the dynamics of T cell proliferation in the immune system, specifically in the thymus and spleen of mice. They used single-cell flow cytometry to analyze the incorporation of thymidine analogue during pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo and DNA content. The model, based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), simulates the evolution of single cell behavior through various durations of labelling, allowing data fitting and estimation of proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in subpopulations. The model is simple, flexible, and validated with other pulse-chase experiments. Results show T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, with specific signatures depending on genetic origins, cell stages in thym and sple, and altered with age. The model infers proliferation rates and cycle durations from EdU data, revealing cell heterogeneity and signatures. The study assesses the impact of genetics and aging on the immune system by investigating T lymphocyte dynamics across differentiation in thym and sple. It provides a detailed quantification of cell proliferation in subpopulations along differentiation from thym to sple and aging. The model allows comparison of effect of age and genetics on lymphocyte dynamics from early thym to final maturation sple. Fitting data was done by simulating cells through cycle labelling over bi-dimensional parameters, constraining parameters with biological hypotheses. Proliferation rates were compared for thym and sple, abstracting phenotypic heterogeneity T cells in young and old B6, F mice.
Researchers have identified a mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mice that recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation in humans. The mutation, a G>A transition at position 9 in the mt-T gene, leads to abnormal folding of the tRNA that cannot be charged with isoleucine. Cells harboring the mutant tRNA show exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by an increase in ROS production as a compensatory response. This response partially compensates for the deficiency. The study demonstrates the implication of ROS-mediated biogenesis in the expression of tRNA mutations found in patients. Mitochondrial tRNA mutations, particularly those in t genes, are scarce but intriguing for understanding human pathology and can serve as models for evolution and fixation of mitochondrial mutations. To date, sources of this type of mutations have only been found in humans. The study proposes that the pathogenic mechanism combined with compensatory mechanism explains the penetrance pattern of this mutation, allowing for evolution of tRNAs where two deleterious alleles can proceed in steps not requiring simultaneous mutation of both. This contrasts with mutations affecting protein-coding genes, where biogenesis is detrimental rather than compensatory.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the active X chromosome in human triploid cells, where dosage compensation is achieved by doubling X-linked gene expression in both sexes and X-inactivation in females. They used expression arrays to compare X-linked and autosomal gene expression in human triploid cells. The average X:autosome ratio was about 1 in normal diploid cells, but lower (0.81-0.84) in triploid with one active X and higher (1.32-1.4) in triploid with two X's. X-linked expression in triploid does not strictly respond to autosomal nor is adjusted to balance. Unbalanced X:aut ratios may contribute to abnormal phenotypes with triploidy. Autosomal expression per gene copy was similar in triploid versus diploid, indicating no global effect on autosomal. In trip with two X's, data support doubling X-linked expression. However, in trip with single X, X-linked expression adjusted by epigenetic sensing X/aut ratio. A mechanism may act on subset genes with dosage relation autos critical. A range of X-linked expression in relation ploidy was found, with subset (~7%) genes proportional autos sets.
The dN/d ratio, a measure of evolutionary pressures on proteins, was originally developed for distantly diverged sequences. However, it is often applied to sequences from a single population, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms. This study examines the expected d/d ratio for samples from a single population under selection and finds it is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. The hallmark of positive selection, d/d>1, is violated within a population. The relationship between selection and d/d does not follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer pressures from d/d. This has implications for interpreting d/d measurements among population-genetic samples. 

The relationship between selection and d/d is different for samples from a population compared to divergent lineages. Standard tests for selection based on d are sensitive to divergent lineage assumption violations. In single population samples, differences represent polymorphisms, not fixation events along lineages. The study analyzes the population genetics of d/d. Simulations confirm theoretical analysis d/d. The relationship between selection and d/d is described by Equation 2 when comparing divergent lineages. However, within a population, the relationship is different. Negative selection induces low d/d, while divergent lineages produce extreme d. Results have implications for inferences of selection based on d among conspecific samples. Even independently evolving populations, d's power to detect selection is low when majority sites evolve purifying.
Researchers investigated the effect of natural selection on neutral divergence between closely and distantly related species. They found that neutral divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively with recombination rate. Similarly, divergence between distantly related species, such as humans and rodents, is negatively correlated with functional and positively with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors. Coalescent models indicate that background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of variance in divergence across the genome. The study suggests that natural selection can indirectly affect neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. The findings have implications for understanding genome evolution and interpreting genetic variation.
Researchers investigated the role of the CK2 kinase in the regulation of the Drosila circadian clock, specifically targeting the CLOCK (CLK) protein. They found that CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes CLK, reducing its activity, contrary to the previously known effect of CK1, which promotes CLK degradation. Downregulation of CKα, the catalytic subunit of CK, leads to CLK degradation, even in the absence of PER and TIM. Unexpectedly, the regulatory β subunit of the CK holoenzyme is not required for CLK regulation. Downregulation of CKα decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIM transcription, indicating CK inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. This suggests a counteracting effect of CK1 and CK2 on CLK stability and transcriptional activity. Temporal phosphorylation of clock proteins is a key feature of the transcription-translational feedback loop in the Dila circadian clock. The study aimed to determine if CK was involved in control of CLK phosphorylation and its effect on circadian function. Findings define the first kinase of Dila CLK involved in degradation and hyperphosphorylation. CKα inhibition stabilizes strongly active CLK, joining the club of circadian transcription factors with similar to the W complex in Neuroora. Results indicate CK might be key in mechanism, promoting stability and decreasing activity. It remains to be seen how CK and DB-dependent activities interact to set CLK activity in the circadian cycle.
Researchers investigated the role of cruzain, a cysteine peptidase, in the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, and its invertebrate host Rhodnius prolix. They found that treatment with anti-cruzain antibodies or cystine peid inhibitors significantly decreased parasite adhesion to the insect midgut, except for one inhibitor, CA-074-OM. Cystatin, a cystine peid inhibitor, showed a dose-dependent reduction in adhesion. Comparison of adhesion among T cruzi isolates revealed that one isolate with low levels of active cruzain adhered less than others. Transgenic parasites overexpressing an endogenous cruzain inhibitor, chag, had reduced levels of active cruzain and adhered 73% less than wild-type. Adhesion of ch parasites was partially restored by addition of exogenous cruzain. In vivo experiments showed low levels of ch parasites compared to wild-type after passage in insect presented enhancement of surface cruzain expression.
Researchers have identified 20 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans that, when reduced in function, can suppress the effects of a cytoplasmic dyin heavy chain mutant. Cytoplasm dyin is a microtubule-dependent protein essential for mitotic processes such as centrosome separation, chromosome congression, anaphase elongation, and segregation, as well as interphase vesicle transport and organel positioning. The 12 of the 20 suppressor genes do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type worms. Many of the suppress proteins, including dyin light chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those reported for the dyin heavy chain. Knocking down one of four putative dyin accessory chains suppresses the heavy mutants, suggesting some chains negatively regulate heavy function. Additionally, 29 genes, when reduced in function, suppress not only dyin but also loci for unrelated processes. The study suggests conserved non-essential genes contribute to dyin during mitosis.
In the ciliate Paramecium tetra, programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) occur during somatic differentiation, where DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) drive the process. The germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny, but the somatic nucleus, essential for gene expression, is destroyed and a new somatic nucleus differentiates from a copy of the germline. In P. tetra, the development of the somatic nucleus involves massive GR, including the elimination of at least 45,000 germl sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). I excision proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism: domestic transposase PigMac is essential for cleavage and DSB at excision involves Ligase IV, a component of non-homous endjoining (NHE) pathway. To understand how cleavage and DSB are coordinated during GR, researchers focused on Ku, the actor of HE-mediated repair. Two Ku70 and Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the genome of P. tet: Ku70 and Ku80 are produced during sexual processes and localize in developing somatic nucleus. Using interference, the development-specific Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer is essential for recovery of functional somatic nucleus. Strikingly, PigMac-dependent cleavage is abolished at IES in cells depleted Ku80, resulting IES retention in somatic genome.
Researchers investigated the early mechanisms of pathology in prion disease by analyzing the transcriptional dynamics of hippocampal CA1 neurons in infected mice. They used laser microdissection to isolate neurons and found that gene expression is dynamic, characterized by distinct phases, with a major cluster of genes altered preclinically returning to basal levels or reversing during clinical disease. This cluster contains a signature of N-methyl-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor and neuroprotective pathways. Genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered, leading to a decline in synaptic protein expression. Deregulated miRNAs, such as mi-132p, mi-124p, mi-16, mi-26, mi-29, and mi-140, followed concomitant patterns. The study is the first to describe the preclinical response of hippocal neurons to prion replication. Findings suggest prion stimulates a programmed response, mediated by NMD receptor, promoting survival and neurite remodeling, but terminated before clinical symptoms, pointing to a critical juncture in disease.
Researchers have developed a computer model, called a Petri net, to simulate the formation and function of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in the liver in response to infection with the parasite Leishmania donovani. The model was validated with data from experiments in mice and showed that it accurately represented the progression of the disease and changes in the granoma composition over time. The model revealed a previously unknown level of diversity in the granoma's ability to fight the parasite and found that IL-10 produced by Kupffer cells, a type of immune cell, plays a key role in controlling the parasite load within the granoma. The model does not account for IL-10's effects outside the granoma, such as on T cell differentiation in other tissues, which could affect the quality and quantity of cells entering the granoma. Studies in mice and humans with Leishmaniasis show that granulomatous inflammation is a sign of protective immunity and T cells are key to fighting the parasite. Depletion of T cells in the model led to high parasite burden and non-healing infection, as seen in T-deficient mice.
Researchers have viewed the transcriptional machinery of a gene as a computational device with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression levels as output, raising the question of what kinds of computations are possible. They show that different parameterizations of a simple kinetic model of transcription regulation can approximate arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and equality, as well as inequality operations. This contrasts with studies emphasizing logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different sets of parameters and are independently tunable. Networks of "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations by designing a network that detects significant elevations in a time-vary signal. Approximating analytic functions can be achieved by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. These observations are important for interpreting naturally occurring networks and designing synthetic networks. Theoretical analysis and simulations demonstrate that "arithmetic" genes can be combined to compute sophisticated functions, such as tracking the mean and standard deviation of a time-vary signal and detecting when it is significantly elevated. A model of a gene regulated by a single transcription factor with multiple binding sites on the promoter is also considered. Simple models demonstrate the possibility of arithmetic at transcriptional regulation. Other functions, such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions, can be computed by combinations of arithmetic. However, this would be energetically wasteful and require many genes. A more efficient approach is approximating directly using complicated machinery.
Researchers sequenced the genomes of Chikungunya virus (CHV) from a recent outbreak in Northeast Brazil and found that two genotypes, Asian/Caribbean and ECSA, are cocirculating in the region. The study used an in-house Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol to directly detect multiple CHV genotypes from clinical samples. The results show that both genotypes expanded their range and reached cocirculation in Northeast Brazil. Additionally, the data supports simultaneous infection by two genotypes, suggesting coinfection might be more common than thought in endemic areas. The study sequenced 132 CHV cases out of 263 samples initially screened for Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIK) viruses, showing CHV displaced Zika outbreak in Brazil between May 2015 and 2016, but genotypes were not determined. This study is the first to show two CHV genotypes cocirculating in same region and evidence coinfection of ECS and AsianCar CHV genotypes in naturally infected individuals. CHV has caused health and economic burden worldwide due to continuous spread in Brazil in 2014, rapidly in naive population. Limited information exists on epidemiology and evolution of CHV after entrance in Brazil.
The bacterial modulator HNS plays a crucial role in regulating horizontally acquired and core genes in the bacterial genome. HNS targets both horizontally transferred (HGT) and core genes, silencing their expression in response to external stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature. Research shows that HNS discriminates and differentially modulates GT and core DNA. For example, plasmid R27-encoded HNS has evolved to silence GT genes without interfering with core regulation. In contrast, chromosomal H requires a helper protein, Hha, to silence GT DNA, while core genes are modulated by H homodimers. The presence of H-like proteins is restricted to Enterobacteraceae, and conjugative plids encoding HNS variants have been isolated only from this family. The HNS system in Enterobacteria presents unique features, enabling selective discrimination between GT and core DNA, potentially maintaining horizontally transmitted DNA silent and giving bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Researchers compared the gene expression profiles of three Leishmania species (L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis) in their intracellular amastigote stages, which are responsible for causing disease in humans. Genome sequencing revealed conserved gene content and synteny across the genus, but only a small number of genes were differentially distributed between species. Customized oligonucleotide microarrays confirmed that these differentially distributed genes were expressed in intracellular amastotes, with few regulated at the RNA level. In a large-scale study of L. brazili, ~9% of genes were regulated in RNA expression during its life cycle, consistent with other Leish species. Comparing amigote expression between species confirmed Leish transcriptomes undergo little regulation, identifying conserved genes differently regulated between species in host. Immune competence was investigated by comparing L. major amigotes from wild-type (BAL/c) or immunocompromised (Rag/−/γ−) mice. Dissemination was enhanced in Rag−/−γ− background, but RNA profiles unperturbed, suggesting Leish amigotes are pre-adapt for intracellular survival with little RNA modulation.
Researchers have developed a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, named LPhimerus, for detecting Amphimeris DNA in human stool samples. Amphimer is a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimer spp, which has been reported in the Pacific coast of Ecuador with high prevalence in humans and animals. Current diagnosis relies on stool examination for parasite eggs, but lacks sensitivity and morphology may be confused with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed. The LPhus assay targets Amphimer internal transcribed spacer 2 region and was optimized using adult worm DNA from animals. Conventional PCR was performed with outer primers F3 to verify amplification of Amphimer DNA sequence. LAMP was optimized with different mixtures and temperatures, set as LPhus. Sensitivity and specificity of PCR and LAMP were evaluated, with detection limit 1 pg genomic DNA. Field testing was done with 44 stool samples from endemic areas, 25 were positive for Amphimer eggs. Molecular testing PCR3 was ineffective with fecal DNA, but Lus showed 76.67% sensitivity and 80.77% specificity. A specific and sensitive LAMP for Amphimer in stool was developed, named Lus, with potential for field diagnosis and surveillance in endemic areas.
Researchers have identified a novel role for the SNARE protein Ykt in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. Unexpectedly, Ykt forms a complex with Sy17 and Snap29 to promote autophag-lysosome formation, and its loss leads to large-scale accumulation of autophagosomes unable to fuse with lysosomes. Ykt localizes to lysosomes and autophagosomes, and forms a SNARE complex with Sy17 and Snap, but can be outcompeted by Vamp. Overexpression of Vamp rescues the fusion defect in Ykt loss-of-function cells. A mutant Y6 with an R amino acid change in the zeroionic layer retains autoph activity and restores viability, unlike palmitylation or farnesylation mutants. Ykt and V7 are mutually exclusive subunits in the Sy17-Snap complex, suggesting V7 is involved in membrane fusion and Y6 acts as a non-conventional SNARE. Y6 is essential for autoph clearance in Doph larval cells and not functionally non-redundant with V7.
Nontable Haophilus influenza (NTH) is a common inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa, but can cause opportunistic infections in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The bacterium's virulence is partly due to its ability to evade host-derived antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The Sap sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides ABC transporter enables NTH to resist AMP, but the underlying mechanism was unknown. Researchers previously found that periplasmic protein SapA bound AMPs and was required for NTH virulence in vivo. This study demonstrates that Sap functions to counter AMP lethality during NTH infection by delivering AMP to the inner membrane for transport into the cytoplasm. AMPs localize to the cytoplasm of NTH and are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptase activity, but accumulate in the perasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap complex. This supports a mechanism of Sap-mediated AMP import, reducing periplasm and inner accumulation of host defense peptides. Host AMPs are amphipathic, cation innate molecules targeting bacterial membranes, disrupting transmembrane potential and triggering cytoplasm leakage in bacterial death. NTH must acquire nutrients and defend against host immune strategies, including AMP production in response to infection. Altered AMP expression impacts colonization ability to colonize host. Defins and cathelicin are abundant in neutrophils, epithium, and secreted by lung and trache epithelium, limiting bacterial mucosal colonization. This study shows Sap contributes virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo. A novel mechanism of inner transport of AMP via Sap transporter to cytopl for degradation is described.
Researchers investigated how the degradation of the MarA transcription factor, a key regulator of stress response genes in E. coli, affects its coordination of downstream targets. MarA has a short half-life of 1-3 minutes due to Lonase activity and regulates 60 genes involved in antibiotic resistance, including efflux pumps and stress proteins. The study used CRISPR to modify Mar's half-life and found that increased half-life enhances maximum coordination between downstream genes, but decreases the rate of coordination. In contrast, decreased half-life increases the rate of coordination but reduces maximum. This trade-off suggests that perfect fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist. The study suggests that degradation allows for responsive and agile signaling, enabling rapid phenotypic diversity in response to challenges.
Researchers investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major infection in C57/BL mice. In a previous study, MK-2 deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to Leishmania mexicana infection due to increased Arginase-1 levels and reduced NO activity in macrophages and a diminished TH1 response. However, in this study, MK-2 deficient mice showed a similar healing response to Leish major infection as wild-type mice, with similar lesion size and parasite numbers. Analysis of immune responses revealed a reduced TH1 response in MK- mice with lower parasite specific IgG2 levels, lower frequency of IF-γ and TN-α producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, and lower stimulated spleen IFγ production compared to wild-type. Despite this, MK- mice also had reduced antigen spleen and lymph node IL-4 production and parasite-specific IgG in serum, indicating a general cell hypo-responsiveness. The TH1/TH balance was unaltered in MK- mice compared to wild-type. MK- macrophages were more permissive to Le major growth than wild-type macrophages, but LPS/IF-γ was equally effective in controlling parasite growth in both. The absence of TH/TH switch in MK mice, no change in disease phenotype was observed.
Researchers have investigated the development of the ductal network in the pancreas, a branched organ that does not exhibit stereotypic branching patterns like most glands. They found that the network undergoes a transition from unconnected micumen to a mesh and finally a treelike structure, a process poorly understood on microscopic and macroscopic levels. The study quantified network properties at different developmental stages and discovered stereotyp traits at each stage, with changes towards optimized delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum. Using in silico modeling, they deconstructed steps of network development into simple rules likely conserved for other glands. Early network formation is explained by noisy, redundant connections as micum form, while later transition is attributed to pruning based on fluid flux through the network into duod. The study shows that although branches are different between mice, the network is stereotyp at stages E12.5 and E.18.5, with transition from interlinked to treel structure reflected in changing properties. Stereotyp traits at each stage and remodeling quantified by standard measures, in sil modeling deconstructed main development into simple rules. Early formation from E.10 to E.12.5 explained by noisy, duct as new micum form, but detailed description of micum formation is missing. Remodeling from plex to ramified treike is less understood, but Villenor colleagues provided insight with anatomical description. The study reveals previously unknown features of development, relevant to glands with micumen, such as saliv gland and glands secreting fluid. Proposed rules differ from deterministic branching or random in mammary gland.
Researchers have mapped the structural and dynamical features of kines motor proteins, which drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes that mediate movement along microtubules. A comprehensive analysis of 114 experimental structures and molecular dynamics simulations identified three distinct conformation clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5-inhibitor-bound. These groups differ in the orientation of key elements, notably microtub binding α-α5, loop subdomain and α2-β-4β-β-7 motor tip. Group membership does not correlate with nucleotide state, but with groupings coincide with necker orientations. Accelerated simulations of ATP, AD, and Eg5 indicate all states sample majorlogically observed conformations, with differences in distal site coupling evident. In ATP bound simulations, necker, loop, and α-5 sub display motions absent in AD bound. Dissection of these couplings reveals a network between active, microub interface, and necker via loop and loop7. Simulations show mutations G325 and G326 in loop reduce flexibility and disrupt couplings. Results indicate ATP and AD conformations are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide, supporting a model where necker docking tightens microub and nucleotide regions. Simulations highlight critical conformation changes and alloster coupling between dist sites.
Researchers have developed a new approach to interpret bioluminescent data from the Lux system, a gene reporter used in bacterial and eukaryotic cells. The Lux system is fast, sensitive, non-destructive, and enables high-frequency measurements, but correct interpretation of biolumines data is limited due to its nonlinearity and molecular dynamics. The new approach is based on a mathematical model of Lux activity, including LuxAB, LuxC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for reactions and protein synthesis and turnover. The model is calibrated with experimental data from Photorhabdus luminescens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxC. Importantly, it shows evidence for previously unreported inhibition of the Lux reaction by FM2. Simulations predict biolumcent profiles can differ from gene expression, with peaks of light output similar to some experimental data. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian scheme, promoter activity can be inferred from biolumcence. Examples show a decrease in biolumcence is better interpreted as promoter off, and increase in biolum as longer expression. This approach benefits Lux technology users.
Researchers have elucidated the crystal structure of Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA) in complex with a capsid binder G3 (G3), which inhibits the replication of enterovirus 71 (EV) and Coackievirus A16, major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The study clarifies the role of key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. Based on this model, in silico docking was performed to investigate interactions with next-generation capsid binders NLD and AL, showing potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with potential pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was performed using available information to gain insight into structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and confer broad-spectrum enteriv activity.

The study used in silico protocol docked two designed capsid binders into CVA structure, demonstrating similar binding mode. Structural in silico results were analyzed in context antiv activity against a range enterir, showing potency and broad-spectrum antiv activity. Inhibitors were tested against a panel enterir (Table 2). Structural comparisons (Fig 9) used meta-analysis correlated features with antiv activity, reinforcing NLD as a candidate for HFMD drug.

Canyon-like depressions encircle 5-fold axes are receptor sites for attachment. Uncoating process, capsid opens to release genome into host cytos to initiate replication is key enterirus infection. Analysis revealed 60 VP proteins in enterid contain hydrophobic factor. Expulsion factor required for infection, molecule replaces factor with higher affinity serves antiral acts before virus replicate. Crystal CVA with capsid binder 3 (4-pyrid-2-imazinone (G3) was presented, energy compound/protein interaction calculated using in sil docking.

Anti-poliov activity observed for capsid bind, highest EC for PV with Leu at bottom, reducing energy compared PV and PV with Phe. Hydrophobic below canyon VP still target for novel inhibitors early enterirus infection.
Researchers have identified the cells and receptor responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrot serpin in Drosila melanogaster, a protein that regulates the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections. The serpin is synthesized in the fat body and rapidly degraded, but its site of degradation was unclear. Using a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation, they demonstrated that Necrot is removed from the hemolymph by two groups of cells: glial and pericardial macrophages. Necrot uptake increases rapidly after 30 minutes and peaks at 6-8 hours. The serpin is processed through multivesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with the ubiquitin-binding protein HRS, but not Rab11, indicating it is not re-exported from macrophages. Mutations blocking late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor and car) cause accumulation of Necrot-positive endosomes even without infection. Knocking down the Drosila ortholog of the mammalian LDL receptor with dsRNA identifies Lp1 as an enhancer of the immune response uptake of Necrot from hemolymph is blocked by chromosomal deletion of Lp1.
In sea urchins, Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the left rudiment on the right side, but the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during left-right (LR) axis establishment is unclear. Researchers found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, they demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for activating the expression of left-sided genes and formation of left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal on the right inhibits BMP signaling and LR asymmetry and apoptosis of small miceres. This suggests that BMP is a positive signal for left-sided development in seaurchs, indicating that opposing Nodal and BMP roles in LR asymmetry are conserved in deuteromes. BMP is symmetrically expressed in skeogenic miceres, but signaling is asymmetrically activated in left-derived HC. Results support the hypothesis that BMP is required for proper patterning and expression of left genes in aboral veg descendants. Nodal functions on right to prevent rudiment formation in seaurchs, so the relationship between Nodal and BMP during axis was examined. Increasing BMP signaling results in loss of nodal expression, suggesting BMP is required for right nodal expression in seaurch. This positive role of BMP on nod has been observed in vertebrates. In absence mouse embryonic BMP4, nod is lost in LPM. No asymmetrical expression of BMP antagonists, such as chordin, nog, follatin, dan, or gremlin, was detected in seaurch embryo. A second mechanism for mutualism between Nodal and BMP is direct competition for common effector Smad.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle, with infected G0/G cells supporting immediate early (IE) gene expression and proceeding to the G1 boundary, where they arrest. In contrast, S/G cells can be infected but block IE expression, and this inhibition is relieved when cells divide and re-enter G1. During latent infection, IE expression is also inhibited, and reactivation requires overcoming this block. We show that the IE block in S/G can be overcome by genotoxic stress and DNA replication inhibitors, indicating checkpoint-dependent pathways control. Checkpoint rescue of IE requires p53, and absence mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 is downstream of p53, suggesting a role in IE repression in S/G. Treatment with CD inhibitor roscovine alleviates repression independently of p53. Importantly, CD inhibition also overcomes block in quiescent, latent NT2 cells. Timely CD activity secures cycle specificity of HCM IE program and prevents establishment of latent state.
Researchers investigated the role of innate immune responses in dendritic cells (DC) in facilitating HIV-specific T cell immunity in HIV elite controllers (EC), a subgroup of individuals who control HIV-1 replication without treatment. They found that exposure of DC from EC to HIV-1 leads to rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of interferon-stimulated effector genes. This innate immune response was associated with induction of SAM1 and LEDGF75 and accumulation of viral transcripts, but was inhibited by pharmacological blockade of reverse transcription or siRNA silencing of cytosolic sensor cAS. Importantly, innate recognition of HIV-1 in DC from EC translated into stronger ability to stimulate and expand HIV-specific CD8 T responses. The study suggests an important role of innate type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells for induction of HIV-specific CD8 cells and may be beneficial for eliciting T immunity against HIV for preventative or therapeutic purposes. Data indicate innate recognition of viral products in EC facilitated by upregulation of cAS, leading to rapid and sustained IFN secretion, functionally supporting HIV-specific CD8 responses. Results suggest previously unknown mechanisms of HIV recognition contribute to cell-mediated control of HIV. Understanding induction of HIV-specific cells by dendritic cells is critical for developing immunologic approaches for HIV treatment and prevention, as most vaccine candidates rely on dendritic for HIV-specific responses.
Researchers have developed a buoyancy-based screening method to identify Drosophila larvae with increased levels of stored fat, resulting in the identification of 66 genes, including Sir2, a sirt family member. Sir regulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by deacetylating key proteins, but its role in energy homeostasis under normal feeding conditions is unclear. Knockdown of Sir in larval fat results in increased fat, and genetic mosaic analysis shows Sir restricts fat accumulation in individual cells autonomously. Changes in metabolic enzyme expression in Sir mutants indicate a shift from catabolism. Surprisingly, Sir is upregulated under starvation, but mutants survive better than wild-type under amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. Findings implicate Sir in a pathway activating catabolic response to amino-ac starvation regardless of sugar content. Characterization of Sir mutants shows excessive fat accumulation, Sir functions in Doph fat autonomously to regulate storage, via regulation of key metabolic enzymes. Studies implicate Sir as key in switch from ingested to stored energy source.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 nematode species related to Caenorhabditis elegans to understand the evolution of mitotic spindle behavior during asymmetric cell division. They recorded the division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabitis and 15 non-Caenorhabitis species and found variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these changes occurred without a clear direction in species phylogeny, except for transverse oscillations, which were an innovation at the base of Caenorhabitis genus. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently. This contrasts with expectations based on C elegans studies and reveals unrecognized changes in spindle mechanics. The essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over nemode evolution, but spindle parameters combine in various ways.
Researchers studied the evolution of the Omp regulon in Salmonella Typhimium and Escheria coli, two closely related bacteria with identical Omp proteins but distinct responses to acid stress. They found that Omp mRNA and protein levels are elevated in S. Tyimium at low pH but not in E. coli, due to differences in the promoter regions of the omp genes. The E coli ompR orthologue can be made acid-inducible by introduction of sequences from S. Tyim. The Omp regulon in S. Tyim overlaps with E coli at 15 genes, including horizontally acquired virulence genes E coli does not have. Omp binds its targets in higher abundance when DNA is relaxed, occurring in S. Tyim as a result of acid stress, a requirement for optimal virulence gene expression. The targets do not share a strong nucleotide consensus; O's ability to recruit genes arises from modest specificity for relaxed DNA, allowing cooperation with topology-based allostery to modulate response to acid stress. S. Tyim low pH results in elevated O protein and binding throughout the genome. E coli's O expression is regulated differently; introducing the S. Tyim promoter into E coli results in acid-indible expression. The molecular mechanism of this difference is due to the omp promoter region, Env protein structure, and function.
Researchers have identified a novel effector protein, N, secreted by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis, that targets mammalian histones in the host cell nucleus. The protein, named Nuclear Effector (N), contains a SET domain characteristic of histone methyltransferases and is translocated to the host nucleus via a type III secretion mechanism during infection. In vitro assays confirmed N's enzymatic activity as a histone methyltransfer, modifying histones H2, H3, and H4, as well as itself through automethylation. Automethylation appears to enhance N's enzymatic activity, as mutants deficient in automethylation showed reduced activity towards histones. This is the first description of a bacterial effector directly targeting mammalian histones. N is secreted by Chydia, translocates to the host nucleus, and has enzymatic activity towards eukaryotic substrates. The study proposes CT and its homologs in other chlamdia genomes as N, the first nuclear effector identified in chlamdia.
A study of 35,000 individuals from 21 different populations found a significant association between genome-wide homozygosity and height, equivalent to a 3cm reduction in height in offspring of first cousins compared to unrelated individuals. This effect remained after controlling for socio-economic status, a confounder. However, heterogeneity among populations was observed, with consistent direction but varying effect sizes. The study suggests multiple rare, recessive variants influence human height. The methodology is applicable to heritable traits, paving way for investigation into inbreeding effects and genetic architecture on biomedical traits.
Researchers have identified a distinct peripheral blood monocyte (MO) phenotype associated with parasite inhibitory activity in acute uncomplicated Plasium falciparum malaria. Monocyte subpopulations display distinct phenotypes and functions that change during inflammatory states. The study characterized MO from healthy-exposed individuals and patients with acute malaria by flow cytometry and in vitro antibody dependent cellular inhibition (ADC) assay. At admission, CD16+ and CCR2+CXCR1 MO were high in most patients. CCR and CXCR expression on CDhi MO defined two subgroups differing in functional ability to limit parasite growth through ADC. Patients with highest CDhiCCR+CX1 MO and ADC activity had lower parasitemias (0.14±0.34%) than second group (1.30±3.34%; p=0.005). Results suggest MO exert ADC activity during malaria and discrete subpopulations induced during infection are associated with anti-parasitic activity.
A cross-sectional study of 34 HIV-uninfected Ugandan men found that Schistosoma mansoni infection was associated with increased abundance and function of HIV-susceptible CD4 T cells in the blood, but not the foreskin. Men with S. mansoni infection had higher frequencies of Th1 (22.9% vs 16.5%), Th17 (2.3 vs 1.5%), and Th22 (0.5 vs 0.3%) cells in the blood compared to uninfected men. Th17 cells in the blood of S mans-infected men demonstrated enhanced function (28.1 vs 16.3% producing cytokines). However, these immune alterations were not observed in foreskin tissue. S mans infection was associated with increased frequency of highly-suscept Th, Th, and Th cell subsets in the blood, but T cell differences did not extend to the foreskin. The study suggests that S mans-induced changes in T cell immunology through the mucosal immune system may not increase susceptibility in the foreskin.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacteria, and filarial nematodes, which cause diseases such as river blindness and elephantiasis. Depletion of Wolia leads to defects in nemode development and fertility, suggesting it as a potential treatment approach. The study used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the effects of Wolia depletion on nemode cellular structure. Results show extensive apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in germl cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilar and fourth-stage larvae. Surprisingly, apoptosis occurs in majority of embryonic cells not infected with Wolia prior to treatment. Additionally, apoptosis occurs in hypodermis, which contain large numbers of Wolia, but hypermal cytoskeleton is disrupted following depletion. Induction of apoptosis is non-autonomous, suggesting factors from Wolia in hypermis are involved. Apoptosis pattern correlates with nemode processes affected by Wolia depletion, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. Observations provide cellular mechanism for sustained reductions in microilar loads and interruption of transmission following antibiotic therapy.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of action of anti-malarial pantoate analogues, compounds that target the malaria-causing Plasium falcum parasite's ability to synthesize coenzyme A (CoA). These compounds, including pantoate and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by disrupting Co biosynthesis or utilization. However, the exact mechanism of action was unknown. To understand this, the researchers created parasite lines resistant to pate and CJ-801 through continuous drug pressure, and sequenced their genomes. Mutations in one putative pate kinase (PfK) gene, PfK1, were found in all resistant lines. These mutations altered PfK activity, conferring a fitness cost, suggesting Pf1 encodes a functional K essential for normal growth. The mutants showed different sensitivity to new, potent anti-mial pate analogs, with one being hypersensitive. This suggests different pate classes have distinct mechanisms of action: some inhibit biosynthesis while others inhibit utilization.
Genome-wide association studies have identified genetic determinants of the PR interval in individuals of European and Asian ancestry, but there is a paucity of studies in individuals of African ancestry. This study performed genome-wide association in African individuals from four cohorts (n=6,247) to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration. Genotyping was performed using Affymetrix 6.0 microarray and imputation for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using YRI and CE Hap II panels. A strong signal (rs3924) was observed within the gene SCN5A encoding cardiac channel with genome-wide association (p<2.5×10-8) in two cohorts and meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% PR variability in African (beta=5.1 per allele, 95% CI=4.1-6, p=3×10-23). This SNP was also associated with PR (beta=2.4 per allele, 95 CI=1.8-3, p=3×10-16) in individuals of European ancestry (n=14,042) but with smaller effect (p heterogeneity<0.001) and variability (0.5%). Meta-analysis identified genome-wide associations in SCN10 (rs801), ME1 (10855), and TB5 (725) correlated with SNPs in European and Asian studies. Ancestry was associated increased PR (13.3 msec, p=0.009) in one cohort but not others. Findings demonstrate relevance of variants in African at loci previously associated PR in European and Asian samples and identify signal at locus strongly associated PR in African than Europeans.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein ARL8 that plays a crucial role in the replication of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a positive-strand RNA virus. ARL8 co-purifies with the To 180K protein from solubilized membranes of To-infected tobacco cells, along with the seven-transmembrane protein TOM1, which is necessary for efficient To multiplication. In contrast, TOM co-pur with A8 less efficiently from uninf cells, suggesting a complex of To replication proteins, TOM, and A8 forms on membranes in infected cells. Simultaneous mutations in two A8 genes inhibited tobamovirus multiplication in Arabidopsis. In an in vitro To RNA-replication system, lack of TOM or A8 inhibited production of replicative RNA, indicating TOM and A8 are required for efficient negative-strand synthesis. Coexpression of 130 with TOM and A8 in yeast showed 5-capping activity in membrane fraction, which was undetect or weak with 130 alone or either TOM or A8. These results suggest TOM and A8 are components of To replication complexes and crucial for activation of synthesizing and capping functions.
In the locust olfactory system, two types of inhibitory motifs, feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition, play critical roles in shaping the firing patterns of Kenyon cells (KC) in the mushroom body. Previous studies suggested that lateral interneurons (LHNs) provided feed-forward inhibition to KCs to maintain their sparse firing property, essential for olfactory learning and memory. However, a single inhibitory cell, the GABAergic neuron (GN), was found to be the primary source of inhibition in the mushroom, mediated by a feedback loop including KC and GN. To clarify the differences between FF and FB inhibition, a model of the locust olfactory system was developed. Both inhibitory motifs maintained KC responses and provided optimal odor discrimination, but only FB inhibition created a response consistent with in vivo data. This suggests that GN is potentially the primary source of inhibition to KCs. The study highlights the importance of understanding inhibitory motifs on postsynaptic activity to reveal unknown inhibitory structures in biological networks. In the locust, FF inhibition was previously thought to be mediated by a population of inhibitory cells in the lateral horn, providing input to KCs. However, anatomical evidence suggests GN inhibits both KCs in the mushroom and LNs in the horn, yet KCs fire sparsely while LNs respond to odors with dense spiking. A model of the locust olfactory system based on FB and FF inhibition was compared. The FF model responded with fewer action potentials compared to the inhibitory motif, although the type of motif affected activity, GN was sufficient to create sparse olfactory responses in both models.
Researchers have developed a combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) method for the diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies in animals and humans. This method, called combo-q, is based on two complementary technologies: a probe-based TaMan RT-qPCR for detecting the RAB species and a second using intercalating dye SYBR for other lyavirus species. The performance of this assay was evaluated with a large panel of animal samples covering all genetic variability at the species level and extended to all lyavirus characterized to date. It was also evaluated for human rabies diagnosis on 211 biological samples (76 positive and 135) including saliva and brain biops. The method detected all 41 human rabies cases and confirmed sensitivity of skin biopsy (91.5%) and saliva (54%) for intravam diagnosis of rabies. This method was implemented in two rab reference laboratories in endemic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). The combo-q constitutes a relevant, validated tool for rab diagnosis in humans and animals and a promising for lyavirus surveillance.
An outbreak of tset-transmitted trypanosomias resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana, prompting a control trial to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets in controlling tset. Two villages were selected: one as control with 14 pigs and one experimental with 24 pigs protected by insecticide-treated fences. The 100 cm high, 150 denier fences with 100 mg/m deltamethrin and UV were attached to timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring with geo-referenced traps showed a 90% reduction in the protected village within two months, exceeding 95% in subsequent months. Tset in the control village remained unaffected, displaying seasonal variations. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and given curative treatment after blood samples taken. Initial trypan prevalence was 76% and 72 in protected and control, decreasing to 16 and 84 after three months. Six months later, 8% of protected were infected compared to 60 in control.
A recent survey of 441 biomedical articles published between 2000-2014 found low levels of reproducibility and transparency. Only one study provided a full protocol and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n=4) and only 16 had data included in a systematic review or meta-analysis. Most studies did not mention funding or conflicts of interest. Between 2000-201, the percentage of articles with no funding statement decreased (94.4% to 34.6%) and those reporting conflicts (0% to 15.4%) or no conflicts (5.6 to 50%) increased. Articles in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack funding information and have private funding. The study provides baseline data for future progress in reproducibility indicators.
Researchers investigated the early targets of Yersinia pestis during primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal disease with mortality rates approaching 100%. They used a FRET-based probe to quantify effector proteins injected by Y. pestis type III secretion system and found that the bacteria target alveolar macrophages early in infection, followed by a switch to neutrophils. Depletion of 92% of alveolar macrophages had little effect on bacterial burden in the lung, indicating macrophages are not involved in limiting Yers survival. Y. pest creates a protective environment in lungs early pneumonic by deactivating innate responses. The authors hypothesized Y. pest targets immune cells via type III secretion of Y effectors. Evaluating macroph and neutil dynamics provides insight into progression to pro-inflammatory phase disease. The study identifies host cells and population in lung during pneumonic plague and shows Y. pest TSS targets macro and neutils during pre-inflammatory phase.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using soluble recombinant antigens to detect asymptomatic Leishmania infantum infection in a cohort of 136 participants in an urban area of Southeast Brazil. Blood samples were collected from 136 participants, 97 of whom were positive and 39 negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) hybridization, and 22 controls and 8 patients with kala-azar. Molecular techniques confirmed Leishmania presence in all kala patients and 117 (86%) of the cohort. Kala patients showed high reactivity in ELISA, whereas asymptomatic individuals presented low reactivity against antigens tested. Compared to molecular techniques, L. amazon and L. infant antigens showed higher sensitivity (49.6% and 41.0%) than r39 (26.5%), however, specificity of r39 was higher (73.7%) than L. amazon (52.6) and L. infant (36.8). There was low agreement among different antigens used (kappa<0.10). Serological tests were inaccurate diagnosing asymptomatic compared to molecular, leading to misclassification in population studies. Studies using serological to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention or identify Leish infection risk factors may have compromised results.
Researchers have developed a method to analyze retrotranson expression in mouse embryonic stem cells using Illumina and Affymetrix gene microarray platforms. This approach allowed them to identify histone deacetylase Hd1 as a component of the retrotranson silencing machinery in mouse embryonic cells and determine retroon targets of Hd1 in these cells. Additionally, they found retroons that are targets of other silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and RingB/E-containing polycomb repressive complexes in mouse embryonic cells. Their analysis suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retroons in embryonic cells, and different copies of the same retroon can be differentially sensitive to silencing, and define retroon elements targeted by silencing machineries. They also found a complex interplay between methylation and histone modifications regulating expression of repetitive elements in the mouse genome. Using this approach, they identified retroons silenced by methylation and histone modifications in mouse embryonic cells and histone deetylase Hd1 as regulator of retroons in mouse cells. Furthermore, they identified Hd1 as component of retroon silencing machinery in mouse cells.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY) plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time. CRY-interacting bHL1 (C1) interacts with CRY in response to blue light to activate the transcription of Flowering Locus T (FT). In vitro, C1 binds the canonical-box (ACGT, also known as G-box) with higher affinity than non-canonical-box (CAN) DNA sequences. However, in vivo, C1 binds the chromatin region of FT promoter, which contains non-canonical sequences. This study shows CRY also interacts with at least C5 in response blue, but not darkness or other wavelengths. Genetic analysis demonstrates C1, C2, C4, and C5 redundantly activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of C2-mediated flowering. Importantly, C1 and other C proteins form heterodimers, and some heterodimers have higher affinity than C homodimers to non-canonical-box in vitro assays. This explains why C1 and C bind canonical-box with higher affinity, yet associated noncanonical at FT promoter vivo. Consistent hypothesis C play similar roles in C2-mediated blue signaling, C expression regulated by light. Study demonstrates C redundantly regulating C2-dependent, and C formodimers interact non-canonical DNA vivo.
An economic analysis of the impact of overseas and domestic treatment options for intestinal helminth infections among US-bound refugees from Asia was conducted. Intestinal parasites such as hookworm, Trichuris, Ascaris, and Strongloides are rare in the US and may be underdiagnosed or misagnosed, leading to serious consequences. The study evaluated the costs and benefits of combinations of overseas presumptive treatment of parasitic diseases vs domestic screening/treating vs no program. An economic model was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees: 1) No program, 2) US domestic screening and treatment, 3) overseas Albendazole and ivermect presumptive treatment, and 4) overseas Albazole domestic for Stronglo. The model estimated long-term effects of parasitic infections and health measures included outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The No option was the least expensive ($165,923 per cohort) and least effective (145 cases, 4.0 hospitalizations, 0.67 deaths over 60-year for one-year). Overseas Albazole and iverect option ($418,824) was less expensive than domestic treatment ($3,832,572) or overseas Albazole domestic for Stronglo ($2,182,483). Overse presum treatment for US-bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is expensive and least as effective as domestic treatment. The addition of iverect to alb reduces prevalence of Stronglo and probability rare fatal disseminated.
Researchers have discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematida displere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and exhibits a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. Nemat displere can invade and replicate in multiple tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine of C elegans, with most replication occurring in the muscle and epider. This distinguishes it from closely related microidian pathogens Nematii and N sp.1, which exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. Genome comparison with Nematii and N. sp.1 reveals Nemat is the earliest diverging species of the Nematida genus. Over 10% of proteins encoded by Nemat genome belong to a species-specific family of R-domain proteins of unknown function, potentially mediating host interactions. The study provides a whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different niches.
Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CS) protein is essential for transcription-coupled DNA repair, and mutations in CS are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease characterized by premature aging, sensitivity, and neurological and developmental defects. CS belongs to the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler family, but the extent to which CS remodels chromatin and whether this activity is utilized in repair is unknown. This study reveals that CS repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro and this activity is greatly enhanced by N1-like histone chaper, a new CS-binding partner. By mapping domains and analyzing CS derivatives, chromatin remodeling by combined CS and N1-like chaper is required for transcription-cou DNA repair. Moreover, chrom remodeling and repair recruitment by CS are separable activities. The collaboration between CS and N1 histone chaper adds dimension to understanding how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaper regulate chromatin structure. Results show that histone chaper can cooperate with ATP-dependent chromatin remodel to increase efficiency of nucleosome repositioning by remodelers. CS and N1 chaper may cooperate in nucleosome/assembly during transcription-c DNA repair.
Researchers have created a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by identifying clusters of CpG sites with high inter-individual variation, termed Variably Methyl Regions (VMRs), in five purified cell types. VMRs preferentially occur at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). While most VMRs have high heritability, a subset show low heritability and form co-regulated networks between cell types, enriched for transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs is enriched for genes in T-cell activation; in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-reg VMRs comprises four HO gene clusters for growth control; in neurons, a network of 18 VMRs is for synaptic signaling. Experimentally, genetically-identical fibroblasts cultured under varying conditions showed VM networks responsive to environment, with methylation at loci changing in a coordinated fashion dependent on growth. Environmentally-responsive VMRs are enriched for imprinted loci, suggesting sensitivity to conditions. This study provides a map of epetic variation in the genome, showing both genetic and environmental causes underlie variation.
Researchers evaluated the performance of a new rapid test, Panbio Dengue Early, for detecting deng virus non-structural protein 1 (NS1), an early marker of acute deng, in combination with a commercial IgM/Ig rapid test. The study included 198 laboratory-confirmed positive and 100 negative samples from Vietnam and 263 positive and 30 samples from Malaysia. In Vietnam, the test sensitivity and specificity were 69.2% (95% CI: 62.8 to 75.6) and 96% (95 CI 92.2 to 98.8), respectively. In Malaysia, performance was similar with 68.9% sensitivity (95 CI 61.8 to 76.1) and 96.7 specificity ( CI 82.8 to 99.9) compared to RT-PCR. When used in combination with the Ig/Ig test, sensitivity increased to 93%. The tests were compared at each day post of illness, showing differentiation between antigen and antibody markers. This study demonstrates that using deng NS1 detection with anti-protein Ig and Ig serology increases sensitivity of acute deng diagnosis and extends detection window to early samples, enhancing utility of rapid immunochatographic testing for deng.
Researchers have developed a new computational method, Trans, to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient pseudo-kn and alternative configurations. Unlike existing methods, which assume a unique functional RNA structure and do not account for features influencing folding in vivo, Trans detects conserved helices of high statistical significance. The method was evaluated comprehensively and shown to predict structural features of reference structures, including pseudo-kotted ones and alternative configurations. Trans also identifies unstructured subsequences bound by molecules and provides evidence for new helices defining folding pathways, supporting the notion that homologous sequences not only assume similar RNA structures but fold similarly. Predicted features by Trans differ from those assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, unlike existing methods predicting pathways. This comparative approach has the disadvantage of not predicting function over time but highlights conserved features and does not require detailed cellular knowledge. The co-transcription folding pathway differs from re-folding in terms of time and structure, and computational methods taking kinetics into account have been developed. However, experimental methods await testing in vivo to study RNA folding sequences. Trans is a conceptually new approach for studying pathways in vivo, not surprising given errors in early stages are magnified as folding progresses. Precise knowledge of transcription start site is crucial, and existing performance has been evaluated on small sets.
Plant immunity in Arabidopsis is mediated by a complex network that includes four sub-networks: salicylate (SA), jasmon (JA), ethylene (ET), and phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD) sectors. These sectors interact and buffer each other's functions, allowing the network to remain resilient even when components are targeted by pathogen effectors. A systems-level approach, network reconstitution, disassembling and reassembling the immune response to flagellin-22 (fl22), revealed regulatory mechanisms among sectors in the fl22-responsive transcriptome. Many interactions result in buffering. Resolved mechanisms show how JA, ET, PAD, and SA sectors control transcriptional response to fl22, not detectable by single-gene null-mut analysis. Similar to pathogenic perturbations, null-mut effects on signaling can be buffered by the network.

The fl22-PTI network in Arabid is controlled by four sub-networks: SA, JA, ET, and PAD sectors. Despite lack of response in single and double mutant genotypes, these genes are key in immunity as they are regulated by the network, responded to fl22, and buffered from pathogenic perturbations. A systems approach, network reconstitution, elucidates component functions of the immune network. Our work shows high-order perturbation at scale signaling and transcription can decipher regulation of a complex, the immune network. Network reconstitution reveals mechanisms underlying function of a biological, especially resilient against perturb.

Buffering conceals network components: when a component is disabled, the network compensates for loss to some degree. Plants with adaptive immunity, a buffered signaling network confers against perturbations as pathogen effectors target and disable immune proteins.
During embryonic development, the Drosophila optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primord, consisting of two photoreceptor (PR) types: primary and secondary, as well as the opticlobe primord, which develops into the prominent optic ganglia during larval and pupal stages. A genetic network regulates the balance between lar eye and optic precursors, as well as primary and secondary precursors. Proneural factor Aton (A) specifies larval precursors, while orphan receptor Tailless (T) is crucial for optic precursor specification. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of A and T to coordinate precursor specification in a timely manner. The spatial placement of the boundary between A and T controls the precise number of primary and secondary precursors. Notch signaling also controls a binary fate decision, acting in a cascade of transcription interactions to define PR identity.
Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD1), a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide, exhibits distinct activities between its oxidized and reduced forms. Electron microscopy revealed a previously unknown net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with the reduced but not oxidized form of h1. A transmigration assay demonstrated h1-derived nets capture and inhibit bacterial transmigration independent of killing. The presence of nets prevents migration of h1-resistant pathogens and are stable in human duodenal secretion with high proteases. In contrast, cysteines are necessary for net formation. This redox-dependent mechanism serves an additional action for h1 differing from net formation by other defens such as human-defin 6. The reduced form provides additional protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular structures preventing invasion.
Researchers have investigated the role of the OCRL protein in endocytosis in the zebraf pronephric tub, a model of the mammalian renal tubule. Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 are caused by mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL, but the basis for the renal tubulopathy, characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, is unknown. The study found that OCRL deficiency causes a defect in endocyt in the zraf pronephric tub, coinciding with reduced levels of the scavenger megal and accumulation in endytic compartments. Early endytic compartments and vacuolar endosomes were also reduced in the sub-apical region of proneph cells. Cell polarity in the proneph tub was unaffected in mutant embryos. OCRL-deficient embryos exhibited mild ciliogenesis, but this did not account for the endytic defect. Catalytic activity of OCRL was required for renalular endyt and the defect could be rescued by suppression of PIPK. The results indicate OCRL is required for endytic trafficking in vivo and support the hypothesis that endytic defects cause the renalulopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. PIPK was identified as a potential therapeutic target for Lowe and Dent disease.
Researchers conducted a cross-sectional survey in the Kilbero Valley, Tanzania to investigate the presence and determinants of interepidemic Rift Valley Fever (RV) transmission in livestock. The study aimed to establish baseline information on exposure to RVV in livestock during the interepid period and assess the relationship between RV seropositivity, animal characteristics, and environmental factors. A total of 1680 cattle and sheep were sampled from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2007 RV outbreak. Seroprevalence of 11.3% was recorded, with 5.5% in animals born after the 2007 outbreak and 22.7 in present during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in postepid annual cohorts. Nine ELISA positive samples were also positive for RV IgM antibodies indicating recent infection. Spatial distribution of serreval exhibited hotspots. No significant difference in seropreval was found in animals after the epidemic (6.1% vs 4.6 for females and males, p=0.158), whereas it was significant during the outbreak (26.0 vs 7.8 for females and males, p<0.001). Animals living >15km from the floodplain were more likely to have antibodies than those <5km (OR 1.92, 95 CI 1.04-3.56). Species, breed, herd composition, grazing, and altitude were not associated with serositivity. Findings indicate postepid transmission of RVV in the area.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, conserves a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) to regulate osmolarity. This obligate intracellular pathogen is also dependent on surface proteins to invade hosts. Researchers used genetic and biochemical approaches to delineate the contribution of VC to traffic glycosphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of the parasite and promote invasion. T. cruzi Rab11 (GFP-TR11) localized to VC, while a dominant negative mutant (DN) tagged with GFP (FPTRDN) localized to cytosol and epimastigotes expressing this mutant were less responsive to hyposotic and hypermotic stress. Mut parasites still differentiated into metacyc forms and infected cells. GPI-anch transialase (TTS), muc of 60-200K family, and trypastig small antigen (TSS II) co-localized with FPTR to VC during intramastigotes to trypastigotes. Muc of 35/50 family co-localized VC during metacgenesis. Parasites expressing FPTRDN prevented TS but not membrane proteins from reaching plasma and were less infective compared to wild cells. Incubation mutants with exogenous recombinant active but inactive TS and sialic donor before infecting cells partially rescued infectivity trypastigotes. Results reveal roles TR in osmoregulation and trafficking transialase to membrane, role transial in infection, and novel GPIanch protein secretion mechanism.
A phase III clinical trial compared the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo rabies vaccine (PCV) administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 4-site/1 intradermal regimen with the currently recommended 2-site Thai Red Cross (TR) regimen. The study enrolled 443 healthy individuals aged ≥1 year, randomized into four groups to receive intradermal PCV according to one of the two regimens, with or without rabies immunoglobulin (HR) administration at the first visit in adults. Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RV) concentrations and percentages of participants with RV concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL were assessed up to day 365 post-vaccination. Noninferiority of the 4-site/1 regimen to the 2/TR regimen was demonstrated at day 49, with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in percentage of participants with RV concentrations >5%. All participants achieved adequate RV concentrations by 14. At 49, the difference in percentage between the 4/1 and 2/TR groups was -1 (95%CI -2.4-0), thus noninferior was concluded. RV geometric mean concentrations were 18 IU/mL in 4/1 groups and 12/mL in 2/TR at 14, and declined in all groups. Concentrations were lower in adults with HR administration than those without. The regimens had similar safety profiles, with 15 serious events in 4/1 and 19 in 2/TR, none vaccination-related.
Researchers investigated the dynamic and spatial-temporal organization of the salience network (SN), a brain region crucial for detecting and attending to goal-relevant events, using high-resolution fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and graph-theoretical techniques. They found that the SN exhibits high flexibility in time-vary connectivity with other networks, including the frontoparietal, cingulateopular, and ventral dorsal attention networks, and has the most spatially varied functional interactions in the brain. The SN also maintained high network centrality over time, indicating its role as a hub for facilitating cross-network interactions. Time-vary connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct from other prefrontal control systems, and its flexibility predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were replicated in a second dataset, demonstrating robustness. The study provides new insights into the dynamic architecture of the SN and its unique ability to facilitate interactions with multiple systems, supporting various cognitive processes in the brain.
Researchers have investigated the role of the SV40 protein VP4 in the release of non-enveloped viruses from host cells. Non-envelop viruses, such as SV40, assemble in the nucleus and must be released without being encapsulated by cellular membranes, a process poorly understood. VP4 is a late-expressed protein that corresponds to the time of cell lysis. Water-sol VP4 was expressed and purified as a GST protein from bacteria and found to bind and disrupt biological membranes. VP perforated membranes by interacting with the bilayer, demonstrated by assays and release of fluorescent markers into unilamellar vesicles or liposomes. The hydrophobic domain of VP was essential for binding and disruption. VP displayed a preference for membranes with lipid composition of plasma over nuclear. Phatidylethanol, a lipid in bacterial membranes, inhibited membrane activity. Disruption by VP involved formation of ∼3 nm pores in mammalian cells, including permissive SV host. These results support VP as a vior in perforating membranes to trigger SV release.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular and humoral immunity in protection against Dengue virus (DENV) using a DNA vaccine based on the NS1 antigen. The vaccine, pcANS, induced robust protection against DENV in mice by eliciting considerable levels of anti-NS antibodies and T responses. Passive immunization with anti-NS antibodies conferred partial protection against low viral load, but not high dose. The vaccine also activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, with IF-γ production and cytotoxic activity by CD8 T cells, but CD4 cells were crucial for protection. Depletion of CD4 cells in immunized mice abolished protection, while transfer of CD4 cells with anti-NS antiserum from vaccinated mice showed similar survival rates to pcANS-immunized animals. Results indicate cooperation between CD4 cells and humoral immunity is critical for protection against DENV mediated by NS antigen. This study provides insights into DENV immunity and prospects for vaccine development.
Researchers have elucidated the structure-function relationship of the transcription factor ComR, a member of the RNPP family, which regulates competence for natural transformation in Streptococcus. Com is activated by the binding of its pheromone XIP, the mature form of the ComS-inducing-peptide ComS. Crystal analysis of Com from Streptoccus thermophilus combined with mutational and in vivo assays revealed a molecular mechanism of Com regulation. XIP induces release of the sequestered HTH domain and Com dimerization to DNA binding. This mechanism is conserved and specific to Com orthologs, demonstrating Com is not an R protein but a new member of RNPP. Identification of XIP and Com residues for activation is crucial for designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptocci. A peptide-mediated control of transcription regulator by sequestration of DNA domain has not been reported previously. The study proposes a detailed mechanism of Com activation and offers opportunities for controlled peptide-based systems in streptoc and Gram-positive bacteria.
Researchers have identified the ligands that activate the pentameric ligated ion channel ELIC, a member of the large family of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors. ELIC is activated by primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA at high to millimolar concentrations, which bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that desitize over time. The protein forms cation channels with properties similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, with high single channel conductance and simple behavior. This makes EL an attractive model to study mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this family of receptors. A library of molecules were selected based on chemical features of the lig binding site, and a ligand was located in a crystal structure. Electrophysiology characterized the functional properties of the channel. EL is cation selective and impermeable to anions, similar to other members of the family. The structure of EL in the absence of ligands shows a non-conduct conformation, but it is unclear if this is the resting or desitized state of the channel.
Researchers investigated the progression from eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) to asthma, also known as the "atopic march," in humans and mice. They found that mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like inflammation and were susceptible to asthma. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSL) overexpressed by skin keratinocytes was identified as the driver of bronial hyperresponsiveness. Mice with keratin-specific deletion of RBP showed high levels of TSL and developed a severe asthm phenotype after allergen challenge. Elimination of TSL signaling blocked the atopic march, indicating high TSL levels sensitized the lung to inflammation. Outbred K-TSLg mice maintained high TSL without skin pathology. Epidermal T was sufficient to trigger the atopic, sensitizing lung inhaled allergens without epicutaneous sensitization. The study suggests treating skin-bar defects and inhibiting TSL may prevent asthma in AD patients.
Researchers have developed an approach to analyze the genome of Thermotoga marima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium, by integrating multiple omics data with bioinformatics tools. This method produced a detailed annotation of its genomic features, including genes, transcription units, non-coding RNAs, promoters, and ribosome sites. The analysis revealed distinctive properties of T. marima's genome, such as a high number of genes per unit (3.3), few putative non-coding RNAs (12), and few units with multiple transcription start sites (3.7%). Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome sites showed increased conservation compared to other bacteria. The 5' untranslated regions followed an atypical distribution of short (11-17 nt) and common (26-32) nt. Transcription regulation was limited by lack of intergenic space for most units. A high fraction of annotated genes were expressed independently of growth state and a correlation of mRNA/protein was observed (Pearson r=0.63, p<2.2×10-16-test). These properties are hypothesized to reflect its hypermophilic lifestyle and provide insights into microbial evolution on earth.
A study investigated how contextual influences the perception of visual stimuli, specifically the presence or absence of a target bar at the center of a display. Observers judged whether a target was present or not, given weak or zero contrast at the target location with or without context of other bars. Results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when context had weaker contrast, rather than stronger. When context perceptually grouped with target, weak contextual bars biased observers to perceive target relative to without context, as if filling in target. High-contrast bars, regardless of grouping, biased to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of inference accounted for data, illustrating context influences perception in two ways: biasing observers' prior that target should be present according to grouping principles and biasing internal model of likely contrasts caused by target. Data suggest context does not influence perceived contrast despite bias to perceive target presence, suggesting areas beyond primary cortex are responsible for inferences.
Researchers investigated the paradox of cooperation in the production of costly goods in nature, where cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors who benefit from the good without contributing. Depletion of the common good can lead to population collapse and destruction of cooperation, but small population size is known to favor cooperation due to increased variability in cooperator frequency across locations. In a structured population, cooperators can outgrow defectors despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location. This raises the possibility that defectors can create conditions that rescue cooperation from def-induced destruction. Using an individual-based model of birth, death, migration, and mutation, three mechanisms were demonstrated: def-induced population collapse allows cooperators to grow when defectors go extinct by chance, empty locations favor cooperation by allowing cooperator but not defector migrants, and resource limitation induced by def selects adaptive mutants. These factors lead to the counterintuitive result that initial defectors allow cooperation survival better than their absence. In a structured population, small sizes precipitated by defectors provide a "built-in" mechanism for cooperation persistence. Defectors increase heterogeneity in population dynamics, reducing simultaneous extinction, and selection for mutants adapted to limitation introduces another bottleneck, facilitating survival when def are present. Rapid growth of cooperators in def-free locations rescues cooperation, not observed in deterministic models predicting synchronous extinction. Defectors create another bottleneck beneficial to cooperation, generating variation in cooperator frequency and promoting cooperation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant challenge to the mucosal barrier, particularly in patients with altered epithelial barriers. Research has shown that P. aerugin interacts with polarized epithelium, adhering almost exclusively at multicellular junctions, where it attaches to extruded apoptotic or apoptotic cells. This dead tropism is independent of cell type, as P. aerugin also binds necrotic cells. The bacteria are internalized through efferosis, a process where epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells intracellularly, along with apoptotic debris, P. aerugin inhabits an eocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is killed. The study proposes elimination of P. aerugin through eosis as a host defense mechanism, relevant to cystic fibrosis characterized by exacerbated apoptotic cells and ineffectiveosis.
During embryonic development in Drosophila, the gonad is formed from two distinct cell types: Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and Somatic Gonadal Precursor (SG) cells. PGs form at the posterior of the blastoderm stage and are carried inside the embryo during gastrulation. To reach SGs, PGs must traverse the midgut and migrate through the meserm. A combination of repulsive and attractive signals from SG guide migration. This study investigated the role of the hedgehog (hh) pathway shifted (sh) in PG migration. Sh encodes a secreted protein facilitating long-distance transmission of H through the proteoglycan matrix after release from basolateral membranes of H-expressing cells in the wing disc. Sh is expressed in gonadal meserm, and loss and gain-function experiments demonstrate it is required for PG migration. The hmg-dependent isopoid biosynthetic pathway plays a role in generating PG attract by SG and other tissues whenmg is ectically expressed. This study shows production of PG attract depends on sh and second hh gene g1. Linking PG attract to H, evidence indicates ectopic hmg in nervous promotes release of H from cells into the mesermal layer where H contacts migrating PGs. Potentiation of H by hmg depends on cholesterol modification.
Researchers investigated the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8 T cells in individuals vaccinated with a replication-incompetent adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad) HIV-1 recombinant vaccine and compared to HIV-negative individuals and chronically infected patients, including a group of long-term non-progressors (LTNP). The study found that HIV-specific CD8 T-cell cytotoxic responses were detectable in vaccinees at a median of 331 days following immunization, but the magnitude was not related to the number of vaccinations or cytokine-secreting T-cells. The cytotoxic capacity of CD8 T-cells in vaccine group was less than LTNP and overlapped with progressors, but significantly higher in recipients carrying HLA class I alleles B*27, B57, or B58 associated with immune control of HIV replication in chronic infection. These findings suggest HLA I alleles may lead to better outcomes in chronic infection and immunization due to efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8-cell cytotoxic responses. The study used measurements of granzyme B cell activity and HIV-infected CD4 T elimination to assess cytotoxic activities in vaccine recipients, HIV-negative, and chronically infected individuals, including LTNP. HIV-specific CD8 T cytotoxic responses in vaccine were distinguishable from HIV-negative and LT, but comparable to progressors.
Researchers have proposed that the emergence of shared intentions played a crucial role in the evolution of humans' unique cognitive abilities. This study formally models the co-evolution of intentional behavior and cumulative culture, showing that rapid technological advancement is linked to the emergence of joint behavior. In the absence of opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to undertake joint behavior is selected against. A unified mechanism for the emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans is provided, as well as a cause for species diversity in prevalence of such behavior. 

The shared intention hypothesis suggests that early hominins' high degree of collaborative behavior relative to great apes aided development of modern cognitive abilities. This is consistent with evidence that tool manufacture evolved contemporaneously with grammatical language, which facilitates joint behavior. The cultural hypothesis suggests socially learned culture affected evolution of traits. This study models the evolution of joint behavior, showing conditions for its emergence. Individuals with ability to share intentions adjust strategies with neighbors for mutual benefit. Results show joint behavior's effect on technological convergence speed. The link between technology and collaboration is derived, explicitly modeling techno-cultural advance.
Researchers have identified two microRNAs, miR-34b and mi-449, as crucial for male fertility in mice. These microRNAs are highly expressed in post-meiotic germ cells and their deficiency leads to oligoasthenatozoospermia, a common cause of male infertility in humans. Oligoastatozoospermia is characterized by low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology. Deletion of mi-34 and mi-449 loci in mice resulted in oligoastatoospermia, impairing meiosis and sperm maturation. Analysis of pachene spermatocytes revealed deregulated genes, enriched for mi-34 targets. The study shows mi-34 family as important for spermatogenesis and its deregulation causes oligoastatoospermia. The loss of mi-34/449 did not block spermatogenesis but impairs transitions, resulting in low sperm count and aberrant motility, hallmarks of oligastatoospermia. The phenotype is classified as oligatoospermia, major cause of male infertility in humans. Established loss of mi-34 and mi-449 loci results in oligatoospermia, the etiology was studied by impact on spermatogenesis. Thinning of seminiferous tubules epithelium, drop in mature sperm, and aberrant morphology were observed in mi-34-449- mice. Sperm were immotile and aberrant. Combination with histology, mi-34 has multiple functions in spermatogenesis, regulating meiosis and later stages. Mechanisms of mi-34 support sperogenesis were explored. Resumption transcription in pachene cells necessitate miRNA to fine tune expression, evident in deregulated genes in mi- spermatocytes and phenotyp consequences.
Escherichia coli Nle 191 (Ec) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. Ec produces two siderophore-microins (Mcc) responsible for antagonistic activity against Enterobacteraceae and synthesizes the genotoxin colactin encoded by the p island. Colactin is a virulence and putative pro-cinogenic compound. Researchers aimed to decouple antagonistic activity of Ec from genotoxicity. They demonstrated that p-encoded ClP, the peptase that activates colact, is required for antagonistic activity of Ec. Analysis of ClP mutants revealed activity linked to transmembrane helices of ClP and periplasm peptase domain, indicating transmembrane domain involved in aspect M biosynthesis or secretion. Single amino substitution in ClP inactivates genotoxic but maintains antagon activity. In vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly wild type, while ClP deletion neither protected nor outcompeted pathogen. ClP-dependent antibacterial effect observed with other E coli strains carrying truncated M gene cluster and p island. This interplay between colact, salochelin, and siderore biosynthetic suggests genomic islands co-selected role evolution E coli phyroup.
Cryptococcus neoformans, an AIDS-defining opportunistic pathogen, causes fungal meningitis worldwide and is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Cryptoc glycans are required for survival in the host and pathogenesis. Most glycans are made in the secretory pathway, although precursors for their synthesis, nucleotide sugars, are primarily made in the cytos. Nucle sugar transporters are membrane proteins that solve topological, exchanging nucle sugars for corresponding nucleos phosphates. The major virulence of C. neoans is anti-phocytic polyscharide capsule displayed on surface; polysacides also shed from cell impede host response. Xlose, a monosacide absent in yeast, is significant capsule component. We show U1 and U2 transporters specific for xylose donor, UDPxy, although distinct subcell localization patterns and kinetic. Both also transport galactose donor, UDPgalactose. U1 and U2 required for xylose incorporation capsule and necessary for C neoans cause disease in mice, although not viability in infection. These findings provide starting for deciphering specificity class transporters, elucidate pathway productively targeted therapy and understanding glycology.
Researchers have developed an open-access global database for mapping and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) to support control and elimination efforts. Disease risk estimates are crucial for targeting interventions and monitoring, but a georeferenced global database was lacking. The database was created by systematically searching literature and contacting Ministries of Health in schistosiasis-endemic countries for location-specific data, extracting, geferencing, and storing in a MySQL database with a web interface for free access. Initially, it contained over 12,000 schosiasis surveys from 35 African countries, now expanded to a global repository including other NTDs like soil-transmitted helthias and leishiasis. The database offers opportunities for disease modeling, targeting interventions, monitoring, and surveillance, and geostatistical analysis of distribution in space and time. A focus on schosias in Africa demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a global NTD database, which should be expanded without delay.
A study investigated whether chronic helminth infections exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) infection in cotton rats, which are a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomoides sigmodis and a model for human MT infection. Contrary to the hypothesis, the study found that chronic filarial infection does not worsen MT infection in the rat model. Immunological and histological studies, as well as quantitative mycobacterial cultures, were conducted two months after MT challenge in rats with and without chronic L sigmodis infection. Sple cell proliferation and interferon gamma production in response to purified derivative were similar between coinfected and MT-only animals. In contrast, MT loads and lung granuloma size were not increased in coinf animals. The findings suggest that filaria eradication programs may not facilitate MT control, but indicate it may be possible to develop worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases without increasing infection risk.
Researchers have investigated the role of the DEG/ENa ion channel family in Drosophila melanogaster, specifically focusing on the pp23 subunit. They found that pp23 is expressed in a subset of sexually dimorphic gustatory chemosensory bristles, distinct from those involved in feeding. Disrupting pp23 or inhibiting its activity did not affect gustatory responses, but blocking pp23-expressing neurons or mutating pp23 delayed and reduced male courtship initiation and intensity. Mutations in pp23 also altered the response to the female-specific pheromone 7,11-HD. These results indicate that pp23 and its expressing cells play a role in the sensory system determining sexual behavior in Dophila. The study suggests that pp23 is a potential pherone receptor or component of the phonal cascade, and that DE/ENC signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors.
Researchers investigated the relationship between mitochondrial tRNA import and codon usage in the unicellular green alga Chlamdomonas. They found a correlation between codon usage and the amount of imported tRNAs, suggesting that tRNA import might adapt to the mitochondrial genome. To test this, they modified the Chlamdomonas mitochondrial genome by replacing often-used codons with seldom-used codons encoding the same amino acid. This resulted in reduced mitochondrial translation levels and decreased respiratory complex activities, linked to limited tRNA pool in mitochondria. The findings indicate tRNA import is not dynamic, but rather a co-evolved process between import mechanism and translation machinery. The steady-state tRNA levels in mitochondria result from coevolution between tRNA import and mitochondrial requirements. The study shows tRNA import cannot rapidly adapt in Chdomonas and cod bias affects translation efficiency. The mitochondrial DNA information does not regulate tRNA import. The levels of imported tRN correlate with cod usage, suggesting they are defined by mitochondrial DNA for optimal translation.
Researchers have identified new patterns of glucose regulation in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CG). Current methods for quantifying glucose dysregulation are limited by single-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. The study used CG to evaluate frequency, types, and patterns of elevations in postprand glucose between individuals given an identical challenge. Measurement of insulin resistance highlights variable physiology between individuals. An analytical framework was developed to group individuals according to specific glycemic responses, called "glucotypes," revealing heterogeneity within traditional categories of glucose regulation. Even normoglyc individuals exhibit high glucose variability with CG, reaching predabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. Glucose regulation, characterized by CG, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than thought, affecting normly individuals by standard measures. Patterns of glyc responses reflect variable physiology. Interindividual variability in responses to meals highlights regulation's personal nature. Phenotyping developed a model for identifying mechanisms of glucose dysulation and a tool for visualizing user-uploaded CG and classifying individual patterns glucotypes.

The study suggests variability might precede currently defining glucose levels, representing an earlier "predabetes" stage. Longer studies are warranted to define "severe glucotype" CG's predictive value for type 2 diabetes than traditional tests. Insulin secretion, resistance, and concentrations were compared to glucotypes, demonstrating heterogeneity in metabolism. Metabolic responses for several individuals are shown. Detailed CG measurements developed models dysulation at individual level and related to glucose, intolerance, diabetes, and clinical measures, whole-body resistance, and secretion. A study characterized glyc patterns in natural environments using standardized to follow dysulation CG, and analysis defined glucotypes.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Raf-like MAP kinase kinase (MAPK) EDR1 in regulating plant defense responses and cell death in Arabidopsis. They found that EDR1 negatively regulates the MK4/MK5-MP3/MP6 kinase cascade by physically interacting with MK4 and MK5. This interaction requires the N-terminal domain of E1. The study also showed that ed1 mutants have higher MP3/MP6 kinase activity and protein levels than wild-type E1. Additionally, E1 affects MK4/M5 protein levels. Mutations in MPK, MK, and MK5 suppress ed1-mediated resistance, while overexpression of MK4 or MK5 causes ed1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death. The results indicate that E1 associates with MK4/M5 and negatively regulates the MAP cascade to fine-tune plant immunity.
Researchers have developed a computational framework for spatiemporal prediction of infectious diseases using Gaussian processes to improve disease control and prevention strategies. The framework exploits the structure of similarity matrices to achieve efficient implementation. It was tested on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in Turkey between 2004-2015, showing better results than standard machine learning algorithms (random forests and boosted trees) under temporal, spatial, and spatiemporal scenarios. Gaussian processes can capture nonlinear dependencies and make reliable predictions, outperforming tree-based algorithms. A computational framework based on Gaussian processes was proposed for spatiemp prediction of infectious diseases, combining spatial and temporal similarity matrices into a larger matrix. A Gaussian regression model was trained to make predictions under three scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiemp. The framework was tested on Turkey's surveillance data of Crimean-Congoagic fever, an endemic in Africa, Balkans, Middle East, and Asia with 5-40% fatality rate. The proposed framework has potential for public health policy contribution.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to investigate the impact of seasonality and socioeconomic factors on the transmission of Rift Valley Fever (RV) virus among livestock in Africa and the Middle East. The study found that in northeastern Africa, human activities associated with the Eid al-Adha festival, combined with climatic factors such as rainfall and hydrological variations, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease. Additionally, sporadic outbreaks may occur when two events coincide: abundant livestock are introduced into areas at risk due to demand for the festival and abundant mosquitoes emerge. These factors have significant impacts on the severity of RV outbreaks. The model simulated disease dynamics over short and long periods, particularly during the festival time. Further, it investigated the impact of patterns of outbreaks by festival and seasonal factors such as number of livestock imported, animal transportation speed from patch to patch, and death rate induced by sacrifices. Results showed that when festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive outbreaks rises, especially in the location where the ceremony is held. The model did not consider human compartments directly, but human activities were reflected by periodic parameters such as importation and transportation, affecting disease patterns at different locations along the route. Temporal superposition of risk can be predicted in advance in some cases. Implementations of vaccination and other interventions, such as unpredictable festival preparations, change disease patterns. The model may be extended to consider disease latency in hosts and vectors, and import of livestock carrying RVV, impacting disease patterns. Due to lack of data, mosquito baseline values were not obtained. The study aims to evaluate seasonal and festival impacts on RV outbreaks and dispersal.
Researchers analyzed data on human anthrax cases in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010, examining the impact of Soviet and post-Sov governance, as well as preemptive livestock vaccination efforts. The study found a 11.95% increase in incidence from 1984 to 1995, followed by a 35.24% decline after the initiation of vaccination in 1996. Spatial analysis revealed a shift in disease distribution, with cases initially concentrated in the west and later shifting eastward over time. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, human anthrax incidence decreased, but continued control measures are necessary to mitigate its occurrence. The study highlights the need for an integrated "One Health" approach accounting for the disease's changing geographic distribution. Incidence of cutaneous anthrax was concentrated in the west and south during Soviet governance, shifting eastward towards Baku in the mid-1990s, and remaining in eastern and northern Azerbaijan during vaccination. A 1996 livestock outbreak led to a comprehensive vaccination program, with recent re-emergence in the Caucasus raising trans-boundary concerns. Spatial and temporal changes were consistent with previous research on zoonotic diseases post-Soviet dissolution.
Researchers investigated the molecular interactions between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. They found a putative PU binding site in the open state of the channel at the protein-lip interface, near the extracellular halves of the S3 and S helices of the voltage-s domain (VSD). The lipophil PU tail of PUFAs formed non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydroobic core of the proteinip interface, while the carboxyl head displayed specific interactions with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of S and S helices, encompassing the S-S linker. In contrast, saturated fatty acids (SAs) showed increased conformation flexibility in polyunsaturated tails compared to saturated chains, which may explain the specificity of PU action on channels. PUFs are essential components of cell membrane phospholipids and have been found to shift the voltage dependence of Shaker KV to enable activation via electrostatic mechanism. However, the molecular mechanism of PU modulation remains unclear. The Shaker channel consists of six transmembrane helices, with the first four making the VSD and last two constituting the ion-conduct pore. PUFs have been reported to modulate various voltageated ion channels, including KV, Na, and Ca channels. Direct PU interactions have been observed in KV.5, Na, and Ca channels, and activation/inactivation in KV.5 and KV. channels. A minimum two double bonds, particularly cis, increase currents PUF modulate the Shaker channel by partitioning into lipid and interacting with extracellular V helices S and.
Researchers have developed a pipeline to screen for anti-parasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parv's inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme crucial for the parasite's survival. Cryptosporidiosis, caused by C. parv, is a significant burden in developing countries and severe in AIDS patients, with current treatments lacking efficacy. The team engineered Toxoplas gondii, a related parasite, to serve as a model for C. par infection, allowing for target validation and large-scale screening. A fluorescence-based assays for host cell proliferation and C. par growth were established, utilizing high-content imaging for throughput. The pipeline was used to evaluate C. parIMPDH inhibitors, identifying 1,2,3-triazole ethers with excellent selectivity in T. gondi and anti-cryptosid activity. A T. gond was genetically modified to mirror C. par's purine pathway and depend on C. PDH for survival, providing a rapid assessment of anti-parasitic potential and target specificity. A host cell growth assay was devised to evaluate off-target effects, and a high-content imaging assay measured C. par proliferation. The pipeline was used to probe structure-activity for a series of C. PDH inhibitors, overcoming the lack of suitable culture and animal models for drug assessment. Two promising candidates, A103 and A110, were identified, >100 times more potent than paromycin, the current standard anti-cryptid.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic loci associated with tooth development in infancy. The study included 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Birth Cohort and 1,518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Five loci reached genome-wide significance (P<5×10^-8) and five were suggestive (P<5×10^-6). The identified loci included genes linked to tooth and organ development, such as KCNJ, EDA, HOXB, RADL, IGF1, HMGA, and MSRB. Four of the identified genes are implicated in cancer. A variant in the HO gene associated with occlusion requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31.

The HO gene cluster regulates development and HM2 has been linked to adult height. Normal development and cancer involve cell proliferation and differentiation. Genes regulating organ growth are involved in oncogenesis. A previous study found a link between abnormal tooth development and cancer. Teeth and other organs have common growth pathways during early life. The identified genes have roles in organogenesis, growth, and cancer. Mutations in three lead to altered development; KC (teeth, jaws, palates, ears, fingers, toes), DA (teeth, hair, sweat, saliv glands) and IGF1 (intestines).

A variant associated with cancer and SNP close to HM2 and 6 away from the identified by a study for adult height. Given tooth's influence on dental occlusion, genetic determinants of early eruption may associate with occlusion later. The study tested for associations with time to first tooth and number of teeth by one year. Identified IGF and RAD have been implicated in cancer, HO2, and HM. The study provides insight into dentition's genetic architecture and implications for other developmental processes.
Researchers have created two new mouse models, TsY and MsY, to study the effects of trisomy and monomy of the Hspa-App region on chromosome 21, which is associated with Down syndrome (DS). TsY has a tandem duplication and MsY a deletion of the 9.4 Mb region syntenic to 21.11.2-q.21.3.3. The study found that trisomy and monomy of this region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and balance. Gene profiling of skeletal muscles revealed changes in regulation of genes involved in metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Genes were downregulated in TsY and upregulated in MsY. The shift in muscle metabolism correlates with change in mitochondrial proliferation without alteration in function. However, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production from complex I decreased in MsY while membrane permeability of TsY mitochondria increased. The Hspa-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles as a consequence of change in Gabpa, N1, and Atp5. Results indicate copy variation in H-App has impact on locomotor by altering function.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model of the GIRK1/2 channel to understand its basal and evoked activities, which are controlled by unequal stoichiometry of α and β subunits. The model accurately recapitulates basal and evoked currents in Xenopus oocytes, HEK cells, and hippocampal neurons, and predicts dose-dependent activation of GIR1/2 by coexpressed β. The model indicates that 3-4 β dimers are available for each GIR1 channel, while available α decreases from 2 to less than 1 per channel as GIR1 density increases. The persistent β/channel but not α/channel ratio supports association of GIR1 with β, consistent with recruitment of β but not α by GIR1 to the surface. Analysis suggests a stoichiometry of 4 β but 2 α per GIR1 channel. The unequal association of GIR1 with subunits and cooperative gating by β underlie complex basal and agon-evoked activities, allowing GIR1 to act as a bidirectional detector of β and α.
Researchers have developed a novel computational model, PredTALE, to predict the targets of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) secreted by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. LEs have a unique DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats with variable di-residues (RVDs) that bind to specific nucleotides on the target DNA. The model accounts for recent findings on TALE targeting, including frame-shifting by aberrant repeats and flexible orientation of target boxes relative to the start of the target gene. PredLE was trained on a wealth of quantitative data and benchmarked using RNA-seq data from Xanthas infection in rice, showing improved performance compared to previous approaches. The model enables identification of novel putative virulence targets and orphan TALEs, which are TALEs without predicted by any tool, likely due to incomplete annotations. Promoter-wide scans can recover known targets, but combined with RNA-seq data detect putative targets independent of existing annotations. Genome-wide scans using PredLE identified novel targets, including non-coding RNAs, highlighting the importance of accurate predictions for elucidating virulence of TALEs in plant infection.
Researchers have identified 24,189 non-synonymous amino acid changes in the human mitochondrial genome, but only a small subset has been functionally evaluated, while the majority's pathogenicity was assessed in-sil by software predictors. These tools proved incongruent, leading to the development of APOEE, a machine-learning algorithm that outperforms existing methods in estimating harmfulness of mitochondrial non-syn genome. APOEE was built on 100 sets of variants from 864 known mitochondrial variants, with out-of-b test sets used to calculate performance metrics. Metrics were also calculated for individual predictors, reported in Table 1. Co-evolving amino acids and mean Z-scores were computed for all 24,189 non-syn amino changes, available as a flat file. Variants were grouped for training and test, used to build AEE classifier. Predictions from tools were fed to AEE (Pathogenic Prediction through logistic Model). AEE's logic is based on Logistic Tree Model (L), chosen for transparency, reproducibility, and easy-to-understand results. It uses three milestones: third-party features related to 13 mitochondrial proteins, multi-alignments, amino conservation; reasoning on curated, non-overlapping sets; decision tree learning for investigable rules. Assessing pathogenicity is challenging in-vitro, inivo, due to paucity of facilities, particularly with mitochondrial DNA, less studied than nuclear.
Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) has been shown to activate platelets via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), leading to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic of both mild and severe deng disease and is correlated with disease severity. Previous studies have demonstrated that DENV NS can stimulate immune cells via TLR4 and cause endothelial leakage, but it was unclear if DENV NS directly induces platelet activation or thrombocytopenia. This study found that DENV, but not Zika virus culture supernatant, induced P-selectin and phosphatidserine exposure in human platelets, which was abolished when NS was depleted from D supernant. Similar results were seen with recombinant NS from four D serotypes and blocked by anti-NS, TLR antibody, TLR antagonist, and T signaling inhibitor, but not LPS inhibitor. Activation by D NS promoted adenosine diphosphate-induced platelet aggregation and adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocyt by macrophages. D-induced thromocytia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR knockout and wild-type mice when NS was depleted from D supernant.
Researchers conducted a mathematical analysis of the dynamic loops regulating blood pressure and volume homeostasis, focusing on the arginine vasopressin (AV), atrial natriuretic peptide (AN), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RA) systems. The analysis revealed two mechanisms that perform the same function: one regulating blood pressure through vasoconstriction and the other through blood volume. Both systems are oscillators consisting of negative feedback loops, admitting a single equilibrium that can be stable or lead to oscillatory instability. A subsystem including AN and AV stimulation of vascular muscle is a candidate oscillator with multiple feedback loops, showing oscillatory potential when delays are comparable. The study provides insight into physiological mechanisms of long-term blood homeostasis, based on dynamical loops of interactions. A model was built to describe control loops regulating vasom tone, smooth muscle, blood, and mean pressure, with key players and interactions represented in a diagram. The system is closed, with interplay among AV, AN, and RA systems through effects on smooth, blood, and pressure. Analysis suggests mechanisms of long-term homeostasis are complex loops of oscillators with single equilibrium. AV-AN-RA endocrine control of fluids and pressure was analyzed using mathematical tools to highlight arrangement and function. The whole system can be split into two dynamic, containing VSM and D agents as nodes, exerting effects on pressure and volume. A subset was analyzed, including AN and AV stimulation of smooth, complex between AV and AN-dependent pathways in muscle, and stretch loops onto AV and AN systems. The system is a negative loop of input monotone, formed by smooth cell, with three loops due to: AN released by heart, AV by stretch; AV by SP, by stretch; AV by SP, by aortic carot.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism that regulates thrombus growth, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They studied protein transport through fibrin networks, a component of thrombus, using experiments and simulations. Permeability and diffusivity were found to be key factors in protein transport through fibrin networks. In vivo studies in mice showed stabilized thrombi are covered by a fibrin network (fibrin cap). Simulations, accounting for fibrin's permeable structure, demonstrated thrombin inside thrombus is washed through fibrin, limiting platelet exposure to thrombin on throm surface. Fibr cap also restricts platelet approach to throm core, preventing activation and growth. Fibr cap prevents small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events in 60% of body vessels without major injury.
Researchers investigated the role of invariant natural killer T (iKT) cells in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) growth during infection. They found that iKT activation, measured by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by infected macrophages. However, iKT control of M growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFγ. This suggests that conventional markers of iKT activation do not correlate with their effector function during M infection. iKT control of M replication was also independent of TNF and cytotoxicity. The researchers discovered a novel mediator of iKT antimicrobial activity: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMF). iKT produced GMF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1-dependent manner during M infection, and GMF was necessary and sufficient to control M growth. GMF is a novel iKT antimicrobial effector function and may play a role in cell immunity against M.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, is a common component of the human intestinal flora. To understand its colonization, genes expressed by the fungus within the host were studied. The EF1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during C. albicans growth in the intestinal tract. Unexpectedly, an EF1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, a model of commensal colonization, whereas EF1 overexpressing strain reduced colonization of the intestinal and oral cavity of athymic mice, modeling mucosal candidiasis. When inoculated into the bloodstream, both EF1 null and EF1 overexpress strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, mutants attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation exhibited normal intestinal colonization levels. Expression of several genes dependent on EF1 during laboratory growth was observed during murine intestinal tract. Results show EF1 regulated colonizing level, favoring commensism over candidias. Different genes required different niches and pathways regulating expression during colonization differ from characterized laboratory growth. 

Mutants lacking EF1 colonized intestinal higher than wild-type organisms. Strains overexpressing EF1 reduced intestinal and oral colonization of immunodeficient athym mice. EF1 important for determining C. alb population during colonization. Expression may affect interactions between C alb and intestinal cells, altering adherence or immune signaling. Reducing colonization EF may reduce likelihood C infection, favoring commens over candidias. Despite intestinal importance, EF did not affect virulence disseminated model or laboratory conditions. High EF attenuated colonization, deletion resulted in enhanced, demonstrating EF regulator of colonization during C alb in murine tract. Inlet oral, EF expression low relative intestinal.
Immunization with irradiated sporozoites is the most effective strategy against malaria liver stages, but the mechanisms behind its success are unknown. Researchers found that CD8+ T cell development requires prolonged antigen presentation. Using transgenic cells specific for the circumsporozoite protein, a vaccine candidate, sporozo antigen persisted for 8 weeks after immunization, despite irradiated sporites' inability to replicate and differentiate beyond liver stages. Persisting antigen was detected in lymphoid organs, dependent on CD11+ cells. Prolong antigen enhanced CD8 T response in several ways: reducing primed cells' exposure time in vivo reduced memory size, fully developed cells expanded in immunized mice but not transferred naïve, and primed naïve cells, including thymic emigrants, to become effector cells eliminating parasites. Optimal CD8 immunity against malaria liver stages depends on prolonged sporite antigen presentation.
Researchers investigated the potential of polymyxin B (pol) as a treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, by encapsulating it in biodegradable nanocarriers (PBCPs) to enhance its internalization in infected macrophages. PBCPs were fabricated using anionic polymerization and characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering, size, ζ-potential, Nanoparticle Analysis, size/concentration, diffusion rate, drug release, and in vitro cell viability. Nanoparticles coated with pol (PBCp-pol) had a size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm, low polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.79 ± 0.17, and stable for 45 days. The drug release from Pp was 6 times slower than free pol, favoring a prolonged release profile. In vitro, pol alone reduced amastigote infection in macrophages at 10 μg/mL without complete elimination at higher concentrations, limiting its application. The nanocar P also presented leishicidal effect surpassing pol activity, but no antimicrobial activity was detected. Pol maintained activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Kleiella, adding antimicrobial properties to nanoparticles. This delivery system demonstrated antileishial and antimicrobial properties for the first time, aiding conitant prevention/treatment of secondary infections caused by cutaneous L. amazon, ending disfiguring or disabling lesions.
This study investigated prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Belo Horizont, Brazil, using data from the Reportable Disease System-SIN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) from 2002-2009. The analysis identified variables associated with a higher risk of death from VL were weakness, Leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection, and age ≥60 years in Model 1 (2002-2009), and bleeding, other infections, jaundice, and ≥60 years in Model 2 (2007-2009). A prognostic score was developed using variables from the latest SIN version of ANA (Model 2), with a predictive performance of 71.4% sensitivity, 73.7 specificity, 28.9 positive predictive value, and 94.5 negative predictive value, and 75.6 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. These findings are consistent with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which associated death from VL with age <6 or >65, jaund, and co-morbidities including bacterial infections. Leishiasis-H co-infection and other infections can act synergistically worsen the condition of co-infected patients. The study highlights the importance of considering these factors in clinical management to lower mortality.
Researchers studied the regulatory receptor-like kinase B1 (RLK) BAK in plants, which plays a crucial role in hormone responses, innate immunity, and cell death. They identified a novel allele, bak-5, which differentially regulates three BAK-dependent pathways. BAK1-dependent innate signaling mediated by FLS and EFR is severely compromised in bak-5 mutants, but bak-5 mutants are not impaired in BR signaling or cell control. FLS and E have low kinase activity and cannot phosphorylate BAK in vitro, and kinase activity is not required for ligand-induced heteromerization with B1 in planta. The suppression of F2 and E-dependent signaling in bak-5 is due to B1 interaction with the ligand-binding but requires B1 kinase activity. Results show phosphorylation-dependent control of growth, immunity, and death by BAK, revealing differences in mechanisms underlying regulation of ligand and non-ligand RKs. BAK interaction with F and E is not a consequence of detectable phosphorylation, unlike BRI. B1 activity is required for lig-induced formation with B in planta. B1 dictates specificity of downstream signaling, as B5 nearly blocks F2 and E-mediated PT signaling but barely influences death and BR signaling. Heterization with B in innate immunity is targeted by bacterial effector AvrP to block PT signaling. Function of B in death and immunity is independent of BR signaling.
Researchers have developed a new computational approach to model the heterogeneous response of cancer cells to anticancer treatments. Current methods only capture the response in a single cell cycle, but the new approach considers responses across multiple cycles and generations. The method combines time-lapse cell microscopy and flow cytometry data to render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during treatment. It models the effects of treatments with modules describing the activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and death in each phase. A framework was created to apply different modules in each phase and test at the complexity justified by data. The method was challenged with time-course measures in parallel with cytometry and microscopy in X-ray treated human cancer cells, spanning a range of doses. A model was built combining modules with a strategy fitting all data and platforms. The model provides the first complete in silico rendering of the process following X exposure, providing quantitative measures of G1, S, and G2 checkpoint activities in generations, reconciling radiation effects and new insights.
Coenzyme Q (Co) deficiency caused by a mutation in the Pd2 gene leads to renal disease in mice. Co is an essential electron carrier in the respiratory chain, and its biosynthesis involves a multi-step process requiring enzymes encoded by PD1 and PD2 genes. Homozygous mutations in these genes in humans result in severe neuromuscular disease and nephrotic syndrome in PD2 deficiency. This study shows that kidney disease in mice with a missense P2kd genotype is due to a Co biosynthetic defect. Co9 and Co10 levels in kidney homogenates from P2kd mutants were lower than in controls. Disease originates in glomer podocytes, as seen in Podincre P2loxPlox knockout mice, but not in conditional knockouts targeted to tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver conditional PAlbcre P2loxPlox mice have no disease despite undetectable Co levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and altered metabolism. Data suggest disease manifestations of Co deficiency relate to tissue-specific capacity, with glomer podocytes most sensitive to P2 impairment.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between developmental lineages and phenotypic robustness, a characteristic of life that allows organisms to withstand environmental and genetic perturbations. They found that determinative developmental lineages of protostomes and deuterostomes are robust to cell deaths, with minimal impact on organismal composition. Features such as lineage shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearance of cells, and non-clonality of cell types contribute to this robustness. Simulations demonstrate that this robustness arose as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development, revealing general principles of determinative lineages and a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness. This has implications for development and evolution. 

Phenotypic robustness is crucial for life, but its mechanisms and origins are unclear. The study shows determinative lineages are robust to necrosis and division failure, representing environmental and genetic disturbances. Analysis of three lineages provides testable hypotheses on lineage organization and opens door to characterizing complex lineages, an area with theoretical and applied value in evolution, development, and carcinogenesis. Findings reveal a new mechanism of phenotypic robust and its evolutionary origin, distinct from previously studied mechanisms acting at subcell or cellular levels. Lineage robust manifests at supracellular level, unique to multicellular organisms. Ontogenesis contributes to phenotyp robust, especially in species with fixed cell fate. Lineage robust with regulative development complements sub and cellular mechanisms against environmental and genetic perturbations common in nature.
Researchers have developed EmbryoPhen, an open-source high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos. This platform consists of an Open Video Microscope (OpenIM) that captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled environmental conditions, and a Python package Embryo Vision (EmbCV) that extracts phenomic data for morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during embryonic development. EmbryoPhen demonstrates its broad applicability in assessing chronic, acute, and multistress responses to environmental changes in temperature and salinity in over 30 million images of 600 embryos of two species with different development patterns. The platform can acquire and process data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest, most life stages, potentially changing those studying development and phenomics widely. EmbryoCV extracted phen-level data from 95% of 30 million images acquired, producing high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioral responses. EmbryoPhen is versatile, demonstrated in a range of experimental designs from 2-week to 24 experiments, and applied to two species. EmbCV is a package for automated analysis of video to extract and integrate large data to biologically relevant phen-level measurements. OpenIM can images of numbers developing at different scales. The resultant sequence can visualize short-term changes in physiology and behavior. EmbPhen can whole-organism responses with scale, diversity and quality to study embryonic in phenomics, comparing molecular technologies.
Researchers have investigated the metabolic changes that occur in the malaria parasite Plasium during its life cycle in the mosquito and human host. They found that the parasite's metabolism changes from a glycolytic to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in the mosquito stages. Using stable isotope labeling, metabolomics, and genetics, they mapped stage-specific changes in Plasium berghei carbon metabolism and determined the significance of these changes on parasite survival in the blood and mosquito stages. Glutamine serves as the primary input into T metabolism in both asexual and sexual stages and is crucial for gametogenesis. Glut catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are essential for ookin tooc transition in the mosquito. These findings extend knowledge of Plium metabolism and suggest possible targets for transmission-blocking strategies. They also highlight metabolic differences between Plium species not anticipated by genomics or transcriptomics, emphasizing the importance of integrating metabolomics with other platforms for drug discovery and design.
Researchers have identified a common motif in biological signaling pathways, known as inherent feedforward loops (ILFs), which enable cells to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in regulating gene expression. These loops simultaneously activate an output and an inhibitor of the output, allowing for temporal adaptation and desensitization to sustained inputs. This property distinguishes signals with varying temporal profiles. A quantitative modeling study examined the ILFs ability to process oscillatory signals, revealing two constraints: kinetics of IL components dictate the input range for decoding pulsatile dynamics, and a match between network parameters and signal characteristics is required for optimal counting. 

ILFs are found downstream of divergent signals in amoeba and mammalian cell differentiation, despite differences in dynamics. The motif's ability to respond to transient but not sustained signals relies on temporal adaptation response to sustained signals. The model provides insights into natural decoding systems and network perturbations. 

ILFs are ideal for decoding oscillatory signals, reacting to foldanges rather than absolute input concentration. They are a core topology driving temporal adaptation, generating a pulse response to sustained.
Researchers have developed improved methods for the quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of Orientia tsutsamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular and can only be cultured in mammalian cells, requiring specific methodologies for propagation and analysis. A clinical isolate of O. tsamushi was grown in mouse embryonic fibroblast (L) cells and bacterial growth measured using O. tsam-specific qPCR. Conditions for improved viability and growth were monitored in terms of effect on bacterial number after cultured in mammalian cells. A standardised method for comparing viability of O. tsam after purification and propagation under various conditions was presented. Data supported improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of this organism, useful for clinical isolation and in vitro biology experiments. 

Orientia tsam is a leading cause of CNS infections in hospital in Laos and associated with miscarriage and poor neonatal rates in pregnancy. It is an obligate Gram-negative bacterium, member of Ricketiaceae, differing from Ricketia in genome, morphology, and phenotyp properties. The study aimed to develop experimental toolkit for research into neglected pathogen O. tsam. A simplified assay was used to compare growth across conditions, useful for comparing antibiotic sensitivity isolates. Optimised assay showed growth of O. tsam was quantified by extracting DNA and measuring genome copy number using primer/probe specific to O. tsam 47Da single gene. This is a concern as culture cannot be used diagnostic tool, reducing isolates for research diversity and resistance. Methods were set to improve quant, propagation, purification, long-term of O tsam
A study investigated the safety and efficacy of the antiparasitic drug praziquel (PQ) in children aged 1-5 years, who are currently excluded from schistosomiasis control programs due to lack of P data on its safety in this age group. Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 (n=104) were treated with P tablets and side effects were assessed by questionnaire administered to caregivers within 24 hours of treatment. Efficacy was determined 6 weeks post-treatment through schosome counts in urine. Pre-treatment S haobium infection in 1-5 olds was 14.6 eggs/10 ml and prevalence was 21%. Of 104 children, 3.8% reported side effects within 24 hours of P treatment, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation. P treatment significantly reduced schosome levels in 1-5 olds with an egg reduction rate (ERR) of 99% and cure (CR) 92%, comparable to 6-10 olds where ERR was 96 and CR 67%. P is safe and efficacious in 1-5 olds as in 6-10 olds, the drug of choice for schosomiasis control.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide functional screen in Drosophila to identify genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis, a common in ~30% of human cancers. They discovered multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways and novel tumor suppressor genes, including Tetrasin 29b, which regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion. Human orthologs of the hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing prognostic markers for epithelial tumors. Among the top 100 candidate genes, 80 were validated in secondary Drosila assays, including known and novel genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumenesis. Low expression of confirmed hits correlated with KRAS12 mutation and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. The study provides a starting point for identifying novel genes and pathways in tumor suppression and metastasis of Ras-driven epithelial cancers.
Researchers have identified a gene, wtf13, in the fungus Schizosaccharomyces pombe, as a meiotic driver that kills spores that do not inherit it by producing a diffusible poison and spore-specific antidote. They found that another gene, wtf-2, arose in the lab and encodes an antidote that rescues only spores that inherit it, selfishly gaining transmission advantage while dampening w13 drive. This establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic suppressors and provides insight into drive systems. Four w genes were previously identified as meiotic drivers in different S. pombe isolates, all killing spores that do not inherit them. At least one, w4, causes drive by poison and antidote mechanism. The w13 antidote rescues spores that inherit w13. The researchers predicted w-2 would act similarly, rescuing only spores that inherit it. This is a departure from prevailing hypothesis that suppressors indiscriminately rescue gametes. Three intact w genes failed to cause drive, suggesting some encode antidotes that act as suppressors. The study shows w13 is poison-antoteiotic driver and w-2 encodes protein suppressing w13 via molecular mimicry of w13 antidote. Results are consistent with an ancestral w gene being dual-transcript-iotic driver. Duplications of this driver to unlinked loci could be selected for driving and protecting from ancestral poison.
Researchers have developed an algorithm to predict gene expression levels in individuals based solely on their genetic information, specifically single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the gene. The algorithm was trained on expression and genotype data from a set of individuals and tested on unseen individuals from different populations, showing robust predictions that agreed between training and test sets. Although the number of predicted genes was relatively small, the predictions were robust, indicating that genetic factors such as environment and sequence variation were ignored. An extension of the algorithm incorporated heterogeneous genomic annotations to weigh the importance of SNPs, assigning higher weights to those near genes and regions with high GC content, improving predictions. Predicted genes had higher expression and variability across individuals, providing insight into characteristics of genes that can be predicted from genetic variation. The algorithm performed well even when trained on data from different populations than the predicted individuals, suggesting shared sequence variation across populations may be difficult to capture using only same population data. Gene expression variation plays a role in disease susceptibility and phenotypes, with some linked to genetic variation among individuals. A goal is to predict expression changes based on genetic variation.
Researchers investigated the competitive interactions between virulent and avir clones of Plasmodium chaudi in mice using dynamical Bayesian inference. They tested whether suppression of avir clone AS by vir clone AJ was due to clone-specific differences in immune clearance of meroites and parasitized red blood cells (RBCs), loss of meroites and parasitized RBCs, RBC preference, R infection rate, burst size, and within-R interference. Models were parameterized and fitted to experimental data, revealing that only the ratio of background loss of meroites to invasion of mature RBCs was clone-specific. This ratio was the same in single-clone infections but different between clones in mixed infections, largest in immunocompetent and smallest in immunodef mice. Suppression was alleviated in immunodef mice. Suppression occurred early in infection, before peak parasitemia. Results suggest innate immune clearance of mites most likely mediates competitive interactions between virulent and avir clones. In mixed infections, an interaction between clones and innate response induces changes in clearance of mites. This interaction is unknown, but future refinement of model with other datasets may reveal it.
Researchers have proposed a new model, Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIR), to explain the generation of interstitial inverted duplications, a type of genetic variation that occurs when a segment of DNA is copied and inserted back into the genome in reverse orientation. This model suggests that replication errors at existing short, interrupted inverted repeats in the genome create an extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating dimer, which integrates into the genome through homologous recombination, creating an inverted duplication without losing distal chromosomal sequences. To test this, researchers used in vitro and in vivo approaches in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that the proposed replication error, where leading and lagging strands are ligated to create a closed fork, can occur in vitro at short interrupted repeats. This results in a hairpin-linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted dimer plasmid, which integrates into the genome through homolog recombination, creating an inverted duplication. This model can also explain human de novo inverted amplicons with 2:1 mixture of sequences from homologues, a feature not explained by previous models.
Researchers investigated the process of translation initiation in cells infected with the influenza virus. They found that the virus can initiate translation at non-canonical start codons in response to stressful stimuli in mammalian cells, and that viral and anti-viral responses alter translation initiation sites, leading to production of novel epitopes. The study systematically analyzed the extent of alternate initiation in cells infected with influenza and used ribosome profiling with the inhibitor lactomycin to experimentally delineate initiation sites in a human epithelial cell line. They identified several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, all occurring at AUG codons downstream of canonical codons. One of these sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of its cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain. The truncated neuraminase is expressed on the surface during infection, enzymatically active, and conserved in N1 lineages. No globally higher levels of alternate initiation on host transcripts were detected upon infection or antiiral response, but a subset induced by antiiral was enriched for alternate sites. The study maps the landscape of initiation during influenza infection and sheds light on evolutionary forces shaping this landscape.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE) causes severe diarrhea and potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome, a disease with no effective treatment or prophylaxis. HE and other enteric pathogens, such as enterogenic E. coli (EPEC), Salmonella, Shella, and Yersinia, utilize a type III secretion system (TSS) to inject virulence effectors into host cells. This study presents evidence that E. coli O157:H7 nH and nH2 genes encode TSS effectors that bind human ribosomal protein 3 (R3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer of activated B (NF) transcription complexes. nH and n2 localize with R3 in cytoplasm, not nuclei. The N-terminal of n and n was required for binding to N-terminus R3. n and n are autophosphorylated/Thr protein kinases, but binding R3 is independent of kinase activity. n repressed transcription of R3/NF-dependent reporter, but not R-independent reporters. In contrast, n stimulated R-dependent, as well as AP-1 reporter. A region of n (40-45) is responsible for inhibitory activity toward R3. Deleting n from E. O:H produced hypervulent phenotype in gnotic pig model Shiga toxin E infection. This suggests n disrupts host immune responses by binding cofactor host transcription complexes.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to model transcription factor (TF) binding to DNA, called feature models (FMs), which improves upon the traditional position-specific scoring (PS) method that assumes independence between binding positions. FMs use log-linear models to represent TF binding specificities, where each feature can span multiple positions, capturing complex dependencies and higher-level features. A mathematical formulation and algorithm for learning features from binding data were devised. A discriminative finder was developed to discover new FMs enriched in target sequences compared to background. Evaluation on synthetic and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data showed FMs explain TF binding better than PSMs. FMs were applied to high-throughput ChIP data from mouse and human, revealing features present in binding specificities of mouse and human TFs, and outperforming PSMs.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees, focusing on the adrenergic α2 receptor (AD2) gene, which is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. Knockout mice for this gene exhibit physiological and behavioral alterations associated with the fight-or-flight response. Evidence suggests positive selection on this gene during chicken domestication. The study found lower expression of AD2 in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. Using three-dimensional chromatin structure, a cis-regulatory region was identified with accelerated sequences in humans and chimpanze. Active histone marks were present in rhes macaque but not human and chimpanzee, while repressive marks were enriched in human brain samples. This region contains neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) motifs, each harboring a polymorphism. Genotyping analysis of population data showed both polymorphic alleles reached fixation in humans and chimpanze but not bonob, while the ancestral allele was present in macques. CRISPR/Cas genome editing and reporter assays showed derived nucleotides repressed AD2, likely increasing NRS binding. Signatures of positive selection for lower AD2 expression in humans were also detected. The study used transcriptomic, epigenomic, and genomic data to identify regulatory variants responsible for human and chimpan-specific repression of inhibitory modulator of sympathetic activity. Variants arose in population and reached fixation, with one possibly arising recently in humans and chimpanze. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing data showed active histone marks in macques but absent in chimpanze. Different mechanisms of repression were observed, with DNA methylation in humans and H3me3 in chimpanze. Two segregating variants in humans reflected positive selection for lower AD2 expression. Population and functional analysis in chimpanze shed light on different repression mechanisms. A cis-regulatory regions contributing to human and chimpan-specific repression of AD2 were identified, including a topologically associating domain harboring AD2. Derived sequences were fixed in human and chimpan.
Researchers have studied the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that allows plants to increase productivity by 50% in tropical and subtropical areas, by comparing gene expression in two independent lineages, Cleomeandra and Zea mays, which diverged 140 million years ago. They identified 3,335 conserved genes in leaf and photosynthetic development, and found that genes encoding C cycle proteins are recruited into photosynthesis networks. Despite independent origins, both species use homolog transcription factors to induce C photosynthesis and maintain specific gene expression. A molecular signature associated with leaf photosyn maturation is shared by angiosperms from common ancestor of monocots and dicots. Deep comparisons reveal insight into convergence of complex phenotypes and parallel evolution of transactors underpinning C photosynthesis. Exploiting natural variation can identify regulators and transcription factors shared by C lineages are targets for engineering C pathway into C crops like rice.
During the 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBO) epidemic in West Africa, the virus spread to Europe and North America, infecting several healthcare workers (HC). To understand EBO infection patterns in different body compartments and develop countermeasures, researchers longitudinally explored EBO-specific negative genomic RNA (neg-RNA) and positive RNA (posNA), including replication (intermediateRNA) and messenger (mRNA) molecules in upper and lower respiratory tracts compared to plasma in a HC infected with EBO in Sierra Leone, hospitalized at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases "Lazz Spallani" IN, Rome, Italy. The study found persistence of pos-R and negRNAs in longitudinally collected lower respiratory specimens after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting local replication. The study aimed to enhance knowledge on EBO features contributing to human-to-human transmissibility and develop effective strategies. Results showed decay of EBO total RNA, neg-R and posNA overtime, significantly different in plasma compared to respiratory samples. Detection of EBO RNA in respiratory merely reflects stability cannot be ruled out; however, detection of pos-R with negNA until day 9 and 10 of stay supports active replication within respiratory rather than plasma-over or RNA stability. Detection of markers in respiratory with absence of detectable negNA in plasma day 5 while negNA still detected in respiratory can be explained active EBO replication in lung. The hypothesis EBO can replicate in human airway is supported by a review of post-mortem examinations of fatal filiral infections, including EBO, showing viral presence in lung tissues and nucleic acids in macrophages.
Researchers studied the Machupo virus (MAC), a New Worldnavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, and its relative Jun virus (JUN), which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever. They created a recombinant chimeric MAC (rMAC/Cd1-G) expressing the glycoprotein from the Candid1 (Cd1) strain of JUN, which was found to be attenuated in a murine model and protected animals from lethal challenge with MAC. However, a single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of G, equivalent to the attenuating mutation in Cd1G, was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUN. To investigate the requirement of different domains of CdG for attenuation, they rescued rMAC expressing the ectomain of G from Cd1 alone (MC1), with the TMD substitution (MC2), or the T of Cd (3). All rMAC exhibited similar growth in cultured cells. In mice, MC displayed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMAC. MC was detected in brains and spleens of MC-infected mice, associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, animals survived MC and MC3 infection without detectable virus in organs, producing neutralizing antibodies against Cd. The study suggests the indispensable role of each G domain in full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMAC/Cd-G.
Researchers investigated the function of centromere histone 3 (CH3, also known as CEN-A) in Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant species essential for sister chromatid segregation during mitosis and meiosis. To define CH3 constraints, they complemented a null allele with various mutant alleles, each introducing a single amino acid change in conserved residues of the histone domain. Many transgenic lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-poll, but exhibited postzygotic death and uniparent inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. The failure of centromes marked by these mutations in the histone domain of CH3 reproduces the genome syndromes with chimeric CH3 and CH3 from diverged species. A single mutation is sufficient to generate haploid, providing a simple method for identification of non-transgenic haploid inducers in mutagenized collections. An in silico search identified a point mutation in CH3 in an Arabidopsis line, which, while fertile on self-poll, produced postzyotic and unarent hapids when crossed with wild-type.
Researchers investigated the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. They modified the H9 hESC line to allow for the selection of pluripotent ESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance. Exon microarray expression data from undifferentiated ESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common/neural differentiation patterns. Splice events corresponded to pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control as well as genes with ser/threon kinase and helase activity. Using AltAnalyze, novel changes in protein and microRNA site architecture were predicted to affect function and expression, including enrichment of isoforms opposing cell arrest in ESCs and promoting signaling and development in cardiac precursors. Genome-wide predictions combined with functional annotations suggest mechanisms influencing lineage commitment and ESC at the level of isoforms and regulation.
Researchers investigated the essentiality of the trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase Ots2 (Ots2) enzyme in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) in vitro and in mice. Trehalose biosynthesis is a potential target for developing antimicrobials against fungal, helthic, and bacterial pathogens, including M. tuberculosis. The common biosynthetic route involves trehal-6-phosphate (TP) synthase O and TP phosphatase O that generate trehal from AD/UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate. To assess the drug potential of TP phosphat, a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis was generated allowing regulated silencing of the TP phosphat gene O2. The study found O2 is essential for growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and the acute phase in mice following aerosol infection. However, O2 is not essential for chronic infection in mice, highlighting remodelling of trehal metabolism during M. tuberculosis. Blocking O2 resulted in accumulation of its substrate TP, which appears toxic, leading to self-poison of cells. Blocking TP in ΔA mutant abrogated O2 essential. TP accumulation elicited upregulation of over 800 genes, possibly from increase in RNA stability by neutralization of ribonuclease activity.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, affects 11-18 million people worldwide. Current treatments have limited efficacy and safety profiles. Research has identified T cruzi proline racemase (TPR) as a potential therapeutic target. Conformation changes associated with substrate binding to TPR expose residues that elicit a mitogenic B-cell response, contributing to parasite persistence and immune evasion. Characterizing TPR conformation states requires long-time motions inaccessible by standard dynamics. Accelerated molecular simulations extended simulation time and captured large motions. Conservation and fragment analyses identified conformation epitopes near transient binding pockets. Newly open TPR conformations revealed, along with closed-open conversion mechanism, advance understanding TPR function. Results and strategy contribute to rationalizing mitogenic B response and future structure-based drug discovery.
Researchers have developed an inducible and reversible gene knockout (iKO) system in mice, allowing for efficient and precise control over gene expression. The system, named iKO, enables the target gene to be turned on or off by treating mice with doxycycline. It consists of two genetically modified lines: a) a knockout (KO) line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous gene, and b) a line with tetrcline-inducible cDNA of the gene inserted into a tightly regulated (TRE) genomic locus, providing low basal expression and high inducibility. This locus occurs infrequently in the genome, and a method was developed to introduce genes into TRE of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by recombinase-mediated insertion. Both KO and TRE lines were engineered for high-throughput, large-scale and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As proof of concept, iKO mice were created in apolipoprotein (ApoE) gene, allowing sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. Results demonstrated reversible Apo transcription, plasma levels, cholesterol, and atherosclerosis regression.
Researchers investigated the genetic response of the placenta to Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a mouse model, comparing two different strains of the parasite: K (a non-lethalotropic strain) and V (isolated from a human case of congenital infection. Functional genomics analysis showed that the "secretory granule" pathway was downregulated in both infected placentas, while "inmate immune response" and "response to interferon-gamma" pathways were upregulated in V infection but not K. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of metabolic and macromolecular transport processes in infected placentas, with opposite regulation of signaling pathways in V and K groups. The V strain showed stronger tropism to the placental organ, detected by parasite DNA and RNA. This study is the first to describe the genetic response of the placental environment to T cruz infection, suggesting a strong parasite-dependent immune response that may prevent congenital transmission.
Sindbis virus (SINV) polyarthritis, also known as Ockbo disease in Sweden and Pog disease in Finland, has been recognized in northern Europe for approximately 50 years. The virus is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, but has been suggested to cause recurring outbreaks in northern Europe. A seven-year cycle of SINV outbreaks has been reported, based on human cases. To identify an objective outbreak signal, mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vectors from an endemic area in central Sweden were evaluated. Mosquitoes from the Riveräl floodplains were collected in 2001, 2002, and 2003 and assayed for virus on cell culture. Obtained isolates were sequenced and nucleotide sequences analyzed using Bayesian clade and joining analysis. One SINV strain was recovered in 2001, four in 200, and 15 in 200, with increased infection rates in both enzotic and bridge vectors in 200. Maximum likelihood infection rates were 1.0/1000 in enotic Cx torrentipiens and 0.62/100 in bridge Aedes in 200, compared to 0.9/100 and 0/100 in 1 and 0/100 and 0.32 in 3. Sequence analysis showed all isolates belonged to SINV genotype I (S-I). Genetic analysis revealed maintenance of four S-I clades in Riveräl floodplains over years. Findings suggest increased S-I prevalence in vectors constitutes valuable marker for scrutinizing hypothesized seven cycle S-I outbreaks and mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the interaction between coding mechanisms and plasticity in the locust olfactory system, which transforms dense, synchronized spike trains of antennal lobe (AL) neurons into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB), a region associated with memory. Recordings in vivo from the MB showed highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells (KCs), with typically only a few KCs from the population responding reliably to a specific odor. Different odors induced different responses in KCs. A biologically plausible model explored the possibility of plasticity controlling synaptic weights to ensure KC specificity to familiar odors. Plasticity at synapses between AL and MB efficiently regulated tuning to selectively filter AL output and condense to sparse in MB. Activity-driven plasticity drove specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role in processing and making testable predictions about plasticity at AL-MB synapses.

The study focused on the effects of plasticity at synapses between antennal lobe projection neurons (PNs) and Kenyon cells (KCs) in the calyx. The locust olfactory system is a favorable model for studying interplay of codes with plasticity and learning, as sparseness is a strategy exploited by different modalities across organisms. The study is consistent with recent results supporting pre-synaptic plasticity between KC and mushroom extrinsic neurons in olfactory memory. Intracellular recordings in vivo revealed synapses from KC onto targets undergo STDP on a/−25 timescale.

The locust system is ideal to study interaction of coding with plasticity and mechanisms due to well-characterized spatio-temporal input to MB. In the antennalobe, oscillatory synchronization is a feature of population coding during odor presentation, transient ensembles participate encoding.
Researchers conducted the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene (ST) study to identify functionally associated genes involved in coronary artery disease (CAD) development. They analyzed transcription profiles of liver, skeletal muscle, and visceral fat tissues from 66 patients and atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial walls from 40 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery, resulting in 60 clusters of 3,958 genes. Two clusters, atherosclerotic lesion and visceral fat, segregated patients into groups differing in coronary stenosis extent (p=0.008 and p=0.000). Associations with atherosclerosis were validated by carotid atheros expression profiles. One cluster relating caridosis (p=0.04) and 27 genes relating coronaryenosis (p<0.001) were confirmed. Genes in transendothelial migration leukocytes (TE) pathway were overrepresented in three clusters, referred as atherosclerosis module (A). A-module was found genetically enriched in CAD by 1.8-fold (p<0.004) in independent cohorts. Transcription-factor LIM binding 2 (L2) was identified as A-module regulator, supported by subnetwork analysis, cellular and expression L2, and TE genes in L2-deficient arterial. A-module appears important in atherosclerosis, with L2 in CAD research.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus, focusing on the KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock. They found that KaiC undergoes different phosphorylation states during the day, but it was unclear which state promotes or suppresses transcription of its own gene, kaiBC. A new model, the TT/PT, was developed, considering four phosphorylation states of Kai and transcriptional/translational feedback. Among 32 tested combinations, only one two-loop mechanism reproduced experimental observations, including effects of knocking out or overexpressing kai genes. Phosphorylated KaiC activates and unphosphorylated Kai suppress kBC transcription. The model suggests peak ratio of positive and negative components of kBC expression determines response to removal or overexpression of k genes. The TT/PT model and two-loop structures found in mammalian clock are discussed. The study supports different phosphorylation states of Kai govern timing of cyanobacterial circadian oscillator and output gene expression. Kai promotes kBC expression and represses it, but unclear which state is involved in activation or suppression. Regulation of kBC plays a role in cyanobacterial clock. In Synechoccus, kA, B, and C genes are adjacent, with kB and C as a dicronic operon and kA with own promoter. kA is rhythmically abundant but not protein. Activation and repression of kBC is accompanied by transcription inhibition of clock genes. In Syoccus, 30-64% of transcriptome is circadian, while kBC and proteins exhibit cycles. Overexpression of kC resets rhythm. Existing reports on k regulation are inconsistent.
A study investigated the distribution of HIV-2 reservoirs in peripheral blood cells of individuals with non-progressing HIV-2 infection. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were sorted into subsets: monocytes, naive (TN), central-memory (TCM), transitional (TM), and effector-memory (TEM) cells. HIV-2 was undetectable in monocytes and quantifiable in TM cells from 4 individuals (median: 2.25x10^6 cells) but only in TC from 1 individual (1.75x10^6 cells). HIV- levels in PBMC (median:1.94x10^6) correlated with TM (r=0.66, p=0.01) but not TC. HIV reactivation was observed in cells from 3 individuals. CCR5 co-receptor was distributed similarly in populations. TC had lower CXCR transcripts (p=0.002) and higher TRIM transcripts (p=0.004) than TM. HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 by lack of monocytic infection and limited TC infection associated with lower CXCR and higher TRIM expression. This sheds light on HIV-2 pathogenicity suggesting mechanisms similar to attenuated HIV/SIV models.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Attention Routing Circuit (ARC) that provides a mechanistic explanation for selective attention processing in the cortex. The model is implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons, with computations for selective attention mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. It simulates attention studies in macaques and quantitatively matches several forms of attentional modulation. The model demonstrates that shifts in spatial attention result in shrinking receptive fields, increased responses without changes in non-spatial feature selectivity, and that contrast-response functions are better explained by response-gain than contrast-gain. Unlike previous models, ARC unifies forms of attention modulation, consistent with a wide range of data and makes specific predictions. The model overcomes past limitations by providing a unified explanation of attention effects, implemented in spiking neurons, defining attention modulation across cortical areas, comparing to physiological data, and making testable predictions. ARC's mechanisms predict spatial attention affects selectivity without altering selectivity other dimensions, distinguishing it from normalization model. It qualitatively, the model's prediction is that forms of attention modulation are consequences of single selective routing mechanism. A functional mechanism for attention routing is described in a hierarchical model, with biological plausibility demonstrated by spiking implementation accounting for attention effects. The model suggests proportion of neurons in higher cortical areas show modulation, as a result of switching from default to selective state during attention tasks, with magnitude increasing in higher areas.
A large-scale whole-exome sequencing study of 1,734 individuals with atrial fibrillation (AF) and 9,423 controls from the Framingham Study, Atherosclerosis in Communities Study, and NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project found no significant associations between coding variants and AF. The study examined 99,404 common variants and 37 suspected AF genes, but none remained significant after adjusting for multiple testing. A missense variant in SYNPOL (rs262, p.Pro707Leu, odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.43, P=6.6x10-5) was the most associated variant, located at a known AF locus and in linkage disequilibrium with a prior marker. No significant associations were found between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Individuals with AF did not display enrichment for common or rare variation in implicated genes. The study suggests large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF, and a variant in SYN2 requires further evaluation for causality. Efforts to identify biologically meaningful variation may require larger sample sizes or populations with large effects.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 cases of alveolar echoccosis (AE) were diagnosed in Poland, with 83.6% classified as confirmed, 16 as probable, and 22 as possible. The number of cases increased over the two decades, with a mean age at diagnosis of 47.7 years and a male to female ratio of 0.86:1. The disease was fatal in 19% of patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years. Aggregation of AE was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients, with 76 cases diagnosed in an advanced stage. The liver was the primary location in all cases, with 24.8% showing spread to other organs. 94 patients were treated with albendazole and 73 underwent surgery, including 15 liver transplants. The study confirms AE as an emerging disease in Poland, the 4th in Europe with over 120 cases, indicating a need for a national screening program in high-risk areas (northern Poland) and public awareness of E. multular and training of primary physicians for early detection.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escheria coli to understand how microorganisms respond to dynamic changes in zinc availability. They solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PnuABC promoter and found that the metalregulatory protein represses gene expression by cooperative binding two dimers to the core of regulated promoters. Cooperativity requires a pair of salt bridges between Arg and Asp that connect independent dimers. Analysis revealed a new member of the regulon, plG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner. The plG forms complexes with one or two dimers with less cooperativity than other regul promoters. Comparison of in vitro Zur-DNA binding at four regulon promoters shows a 10,000-fold variation in binding constants. The degree of repression in vivo parallels this trend, with a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δur strains. The number of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) dimers that bind varies significantly, and the thermodynamic profile of Zur-D interactions correlates with physiological response at different promoters. This study supports the idea that thermodynamics of protein-DNA interactions play a dominant role in gene regulation and opens the door to understanding how zinc availability fine-tunes responsive expression across promoters.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 2008-2009, a RV outbreak affected the whole island of Madagascar, including the Anjorobe district in the highlands. An entomological survey showed absence of Aedes among potential RV virus (RV) vector species in the area, and low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. Serological and virological signs of infection were not observed in wild mammals, suggesting absence of RV virusRV reservoir. However, three serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed recurrent RVV circulation. A spatial deterministic metapulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed to understand determinants of this transmission. Three scenarios were analyzed: (i) RVV overwintering due to direct transmission between vemic cows, vector absent during winter, (ii) low vector circulation during winter due residual population without transmission, (iii) combination of both. Multi-model inference resulted in incorporating low RVV winter-borne transmission and direct between animals. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced observations, 84% attributed to vector-b transmission, 16 to direct. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Interactions between agricultural fields, vector seasonality, and cattle practices are key to understanding RVV circulation in Madagascar highlands.
Researchers investigated the historical and contemporary genetic structure of the Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, in the Indo-Pacific region using 13 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial COI sequences from 911 individuals. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was employed to test competing invasion routes of Ae. albict within the Southeast Asian/Australian region. Results showed Ae. albict was likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia, colonizing the Solomon Islands via Papua New Guinea or Asia, and the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait was seeded from Indonesia. A colonized population in the Torres Islands underwent rapid genetic changes, possibly due to genetic drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source. High genetic structure and gene flow were found between geographically distant populations, driven by human dispersal. The species' structure favors a dispersal pattern. This study provides a wider distribution of the species' range, revealing more spatial structure than previously shown. The invasion history of Ae. albict in the Australasian region was analyzed using ABC. Populations from the Indian Ocean, Fiji, Naur, and USA were not included due to insufficient sampling. COI and microsatellite loci were analyzed using ABC in DIY v2.1.0.0. Populations from Naur, Torres Islands, Australia, and USA, and Asia were included for broader analysis.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Mwan Region, North-West Tanzania to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mans) infection on morbidity in 572 school-aged children. The prevalence of S. mans infection was 58.7% with a mean intensity of 207.3 (95% CI 169.2-245.4) eggs per gram. Most infections were light (56.5%), while 16.4% had heavy infections. Girls had significantly higher mean intensities than boys (247.4 (95% CI 189.2-305.6) vs 153.2 (110.6-195.8); P=0.004. A total 30.1% were anemic with no sex difference. Stunting and wasting were found in less than 10% of the population. There was no association between S mans prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anemia, or spleen pathology in univar or multivar linear analyses. However, in univar analyses, children with S mans infection had significantly lower emotional Peds (95% CI) than uninfected (77.3 (74.5-80.1) vs 82.7 (79.9-85.5); P=0.033 and infected had higher VO2 (95 CI) compared uninf (51.4 (51.0-51.8) vs 50.8 (50.3-51.3); P=0.042. In multivar regression, age, S mans, hemoglobin, and VO max were predictors for emotional PQL while predictors for VO max were PQL, height, age, and hemoglobin. S mans was not retained in multivar regression on VO max. The study found S infection had significant effect on emotional quality of life but not physical fitness.
Researchers investigated the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation routes compared to the intraperitoneal route on Leptira infection in adult rats. Leptira is a zoonosis caused by spirochete, with wild rodents, including the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), as asymptomatic reservoirs. Infection characteristics were studied using Leptira isolation, serology, and histological analyses. Lept infection was asymptomatic regardless of inoculation route and caused similar antibody production. Renal colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for intraperitone, mucosal, and subaneous inoculation, respectively. Mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization with urinary excretion than subaneous and induced slower infection than intraper route. These results facilitate understanding of infection modalities in rats, unlike epidemiological studies in wild rats. The intraper route is nonatural Lept infection in rat colonies, transmission details between rats unknown. Natural routes could explain heterogeneity carriage rat colonies same region by Leira kinetics. Lept infection has asymptomatic forms regardless inoc routes (M, SC, IP). Response chronic infections lower than acute, no relation to colonization.
Researchers have identified a novel role for Annexin A2 (AnxA) in modulating the inflammatory response during polymicrobial sepsis, a disease characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction. In a sepsis model, An2- mice exhibited increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and decreased bacterial clearance, and survival. An2 deficiency led to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-17 levels. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed cysteine 9 of An2 was crucial for ROS regulation. ROS was responsible for elevated IL-17 and exaggerated response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas KO downregulated inflammation and conferred protection in An2- mice. An2 functions as a putative ROS inhibitor in seis progression, with cystine 9 most important for oxidation. An2 may mitigate seis severity by modulating ROS and IL-17 levels. Neutrophils in seis may be a therapeutic target. An2-induced neutrophil infiltration contributes to local and distant injury and mortality in seis mice. IL-17 is regulated by ROS, and inflammation reduced after IL-17 knockdown. Increased IL-17 correlated with ROS in An- mice, and IL- KO inhibited response in seis mice. An2 is an intracellular protein involved in cytoplasmic membrane processes, including immunity, endosome function, and inflammation. Overall, An2 plays a critical role in inhibiting inflammatory response by regulating ROS and IL-17 in seis.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in the anti-HIV-1 effects of Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation in macrophages. They found that polyinos-polycidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ligands for TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, decreased HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) by abrogating CCR5-using macroageotropic HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudyped HIV-1 virions. However, TLR2, T7, or T9 agonists only partially reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR expression, type interferon induction, or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Integrated viruses were detected in unstimulated T7 and T9-stimulated cells, but not T3 or T4-stim MDMs, suggesting alteration of post-entry preintegration events. Microarray analysis and reverse transcription PCR found increased mi-155 levels in MDM upon T3 but not T7 stimulation, and mi-155 inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly I-stimulated MDMs. Ectopic mi-155 expression diminished HIV-1 in primary MDM and cell lines. Poly I-stimulation and ectopic mi-155 resulted in accumulation of late RT products and undetectable or low integrated viruses 2TR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels of HIV-1 factors AD10, TN3, N153, LED/p75 were in poly-stim and mi-transfected MDM, and reporter suggested authentic mi- targets.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the circadian clock, light, and plant growth-promoting hormone pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. They found that a group of hormone-associated genes are co-expressed at the time of maximal hypocotyl growth, which correlates with the overrepresentation of a cis-acting element (CAT) in hormone gene promoters. This element is sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian expression in vivo. Using circadian and light mutants, they showed that internal phytohorm signaling and external coincidence with darkness are required for wild-type growth. The circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive of light-phytohorm transcript levels at the proper time of day. This integration of pathways allows plants to fine-tune phyh responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth. The study suggests that the circadian clock mediates changes in chromatin modifications, and the gated model provides a time framework for understanding the relationship between the circadian, light, and phyhorm-regulated growth. The circ transcriptional regulation of the IAA-signaling pathway plays a role in IAA-mediated growth, and the circadian controls the abundance of 90% of Arabidopsis genes. A transcription module associated with growth increase rate is regulated by coordination of internal phyh pathways with external dark-light transition at dawn. The circadian acts upstream of light to gate phyh gene expression in the evening. The circadian and light pathways interact to coordinate biosynthetic, catabolic, and receptor genes from multiple phyh pathways.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to control Chagas disease vectors, such as Rhodnius prolix, by genetically modifying their gut microbiota to deliver RNA interference (RNAi) molecules. They used Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) bacteria expressing dsRNA for Rhodni heme-binding protein (RH) and catalase (CAT) to feed nymph and adult triatomine stages. RH is an egg protein and CAT an antioxidant expressed in all developmental stages. The RNA interference was systemic and temporal. Concentrations of E. coli115(DE) above 3.35 × 10^7 CF/mL produced significant RH and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and adults. RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after. CAT expression was reduced 99% and 96 in ovary and posterior midgut, respectively, five days after. Mortality increased 24-30 in first instars fed RH and CAT. Molting rates reduced 100 in first and 80 third instars fed bacteria RH or CAT RNA. Oviposition reduced 43 RH and 84 CAT. Embogenesis arrested 16 RH and 20 of eggs. Feeding 105 CF/mL natural symbion Rhodoccus rhodii expressing RH-specific RNA reduced RH by 89 and oviposition. Modifying insect microbiota to induce RNAi R. prolix may result in paratrans strategy for sustainable control.
A study was conducted to investigate the causes of fever in pregnant women on the Thai-Burm border, where malaria was previously the leading cause of death in pregnant women in refugee camps in the 1980s. Artemisinin therapy reduced malaria incidence, but remaining causes of fever are not well-documented. Pregnant women attending antenatal care with routine malaria screening were invited for comprehensive clinical and laboratory screening if they had fever. Women were hospitalized, treated, and followed until delivery. Convalescent serum was collected on day 21. Outcomes were recorded. Fever episodes occurred in 5.0% (409/8,117) of women from Jan-2004 to May-2006. Malaria was the main cause in 55.5% (227/409). A cohort of 203 (49.6%409) had fever investigations. Arthrop-borne (malaria, ricketial, deng, and zoon disease leptospi) accounted for nearly half of febr illnesses 47.3 (96). Coinfection was observed 3.9 (8) mostly malaria ricketia. Pyonephritis 19.7 (40) was also common. Once malaria pyoneph and respiratory excluded, one-third febr infections were ricket or leptpi. Scr and murine typhus were associated with poor outcomes including stillbirth and low birth. One died with no lab tests. Malaria remains leading cause fever in Thaiurm border. Scr and murine typh important causes poor outcomes. Febr pregnant Thaiurm not malaria pyone or respiratory should be treated azithrom for typh and leptpi.
Researchers investigated the relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans by analyzing over 600,000 genotyped markers in 69 French-Canadian pedigrees. They found a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age, driven by chromosome-specific effects, particularly in the middle sections of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions. The study suggests that recombination's protective effect against non-disjunction becomes less efficient with age, contributing to higher aneuploidy rates in older women. A model reconciles findings with associations between maternal age and recombination in trisomies. Further analysis of 68 French-Canadian families revealed a genome-wide decrease in recombination rate with maternal age, consistent with previous studies. Chromosome-specific effects may vary among populations due to genetic differences in regulating recombination machinery. Results support this hypothesis, with significant decay on nine chromosomes in the French-Canadian cohort and two in Hutter. Maternal age is a major factor in chromosomal anupidy, but little is known about age-related non-disjunction causes. Recombination initiated in fetal development, but age still influences recombination. Not all trisomies are equally affected by maternal age, and mechanisms may not apply to anup conceptions. Data highlight distinct selective, mechanistic or structural constraints on recombination across generations.
Researchers have developed a novel immunization strategy to induce innate immunity in macrophages in vivo by priming them with interferon-gamma (IF-γ) against Cryptococcus neoformans, a pathogen that causes opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients. Unlike traditional trained immunity models, this approach generates a memory-like phenotype in macrophages that persists for at least 70 days post-immunization and provides complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. RNA-seq analysis revealed rapid upregulation of IF-γ and STAT signaling pathways following challenge, with enhanced cytokine recall responses dependent on histone methylation and acetylation and increased STAT binding to anti-fungal immunity genes. This method selectively targets IF- associated genes while preserving TLR and CLR functions for host defense. The study demonstrates an alternative mechanism to induce macroage innate memory in vivo facilitating pathogen-specific vaccine responses.
Researchers investigated the role of Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) in regulating gene expression and development in Arabidopsis thaliana. PRs are crucial for transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in both plants and animals. Depletion of PR components causes overlapping and unique phenotypic defects, but the underlying mechanism determining specificity and diversity is not fully understood. The study quantitatively compared trimethylation of H3K27 in Arabidopsis mutants of key PR components. CURL LEAF (CL), a major catalytic subunit of PR2, coordinates with PR1 members in suppressing distinct developmental programs. Flower development genes are repressed in seedlings via non-redund role of CL, associated with LIKE HETCHROMIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). In contrast, embryo development genes are repressed by PR-catal coreunits AtBMI and AtRING with PR-catal enzymes CL or SWINGER (SW). CL context-dependent role corresponds with H3me3 profiles and is associated with differential occupancy of transcription factors (TFs), including MADS and ABA factors. Different PR combinations regulate distinct developmental programs and specificity is modulated by TFs.
Researchers have conducted a high-resolution study on the RNA polymerase II trigger loop (TL) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a crucial for substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation in multisunit RNA polymerases. They quantitatively phenotyped nearly all single TL variants, revealing three classes of mutants linked to transcription defects or stress, with distinct residue distributions. Disrupting the intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, proposed for substrate-trigger TL folding destabilization, conferred phenotypes consistent with increased catalysis. Genetic interactions among TL and TL-proximal residues support the funnel and bridge helices (BH) contribution to TL dynamics. The study incorporates structural and phenic data for high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and evolution, applicable to other essential yeast proteins.

The phenic landscape sheds light on TL residue contributions to dynamics, catalysis, and evolutionary constraints. It expands existing mutational studies and can be generalized to most yeast proteins. The study advances a genetic framework to dissect Pol II mechanisms, assessing TL residues in S. cerevisiae under multiple conditions. Data indicate intra-T interactions and TL with nearby domains (e.g. BH, funnel helices) are critical for TL. Coupled structures of folded TL states support a multi-step folding model for catalysis. Many GOF and LOF TL variants were identified, some predicted to confer epist interactions (e.g. F6 and V9). TL is critical for translocation to DNA, an essential for nucleotide addition. Additional TL states are implicated in transcriptional pausing, structural observations, and cleavage. TL's multiple conformations and state conversion are critical for functions. Previous studies demonstrate TL is delicately balanced, perturbations result in increased or decreased activity and altered dynamics. Distinct consequences manifest as LO and G phenotypes in vivo.
Researchers investigated the pathogenesis of rabies virus (RV) by inoculating mice intramuscularly (i.m.) or intravenously (i.v.) with dog-associated DOG and silver-haired bat-associated SB strains. The study aimed to determine if RV can invade the central nervous system (CNS) via hematogenous spread from the periphery. In contrast to i.m. infection, where both strains caused lethal encephalopathy, only i.v. infection with SB resulted in lethal encephalopathy. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed no significant differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain after i.m. or i.v. infection of SB, but immunohistochemistry revealed i.v. administered SB directly infected the brain, specifically the hypothalamic nuclei connected to circumventricular neurohypophysis and median eminence. Data suggest hematogenous spread of SB can lead to fatal encephalopathy through retrograde invasion of CNS at neurointerface of hypothalamus-hypysis. This alternative mode of spread has implications for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly silver bat-associated RV.
Researchers studied the evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus, which has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans since the 1918 pandemic. They analyzed 71 complete genome sequences from 191 to 2006 and found that segmental reassortment played a key role in the virus's evolution. Specifically, an H1 isolate from 1947 acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the virus's abrupt antigenic evolution. The 195 epidemic may have also been associated with reassortant H1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassment appears to be a significant process in the epidemiology of H1 influenza virus than previously thought. Segment reassort between different species can generate pandemic viruses, as seen in H2 and H3 strains in 1957 and 196. The H1 genome exhibited congruent evolutionary patterns, but distinct reassment events affected specific segments. The study analyzed 71 whole-genome sequences from 17 countries on five continents. Few studies have examined reassment frequency in H1 viruses. H1 is thought to experience less antigen evolution than H2, with infrequent vaccine updates. H1 circulated in humans 1917, then 197, had significant impact.
A computational model of the ventral tegmental (V) circuitry and nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor function was used to investigate the pathway of nicotine's action in the V. The study aimed to determine whether nicotine stimulates dopamine (DA) cells directly through nACh activation or inhibits through desensitization of nA on GABA interneurons. The model illustrated that αβ-containing nChRs on DA or GABA cells mediate the acute effects of nicotine, accounting for in vitro and in vivo data and predicting conditions for direct or inhibition to be the origin of DA increases. The rate of endogenous acetylcholine crucially determines the evoked DA response for both mechanisms. Results suggest the V mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and propose an acetylch dependence for reinforcement. The study used a novel mesoscopic modeling approach extending a population representation of V DA and GABA neurons to describe nCh responses, clarifying the interplay of nicotine's pharmacodynamics and dopaminergic signal in V. Critically, low cholinergic input is necessary for direct stimulation, while high cholinergic is crucial for inhibition to observe DA activity. Experimental results support the role of GABA cells in nicotine's action. The model captures in vitro modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to DA neurons and in vivo emphasizes direct activation of β-containing nCh on DA neurons.
A randomized, double-blinded phase II trial was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan, from 2004 to 2008, to evaluate a novel therapeutic approach for cutaneous leishmanias (CL) caused by Leishmania (L) trop infection. Two hundred patients with CL lesions were treated with bipolar-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by daily moist-wound treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel (group I) or without (group II) pharmaceutical chlorite (DAC-055). The primary outcome was time for complete epithelialization. Biops for parasitological and immuno histological analyses were taken before EC, after wound closure, and 6 months later. The mean time for wound closure was 59.1 days in group I and 54.2 days in II (p=0.83). Patients with Leish-positive biops DAC-055 caused rapid epithialization 37.2 vs 58.3 days (p=0.08). Superfections occurred in both groups at 8.8%. Except one patient reccerations 10.2 in I 18.5 II (p=0.158) were confined to cases with high parasite loads after healing. DAC-055 showed leishicidal effect on pro and amigotes. Compared to intraional injections, EC plus M led to rapid closure and lower relapse rate.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosila cells to identify factors impacting RAS-MAP signaling. The screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, most of which were previously associated with the pathway. Epist experiments determined the position of individual candidates relative to core components, revealing new factors acting at different steps, including a protein modulating RAF activation. Unexpectedly, most hits worked downstream of ME and influenced MAP expression, consisting of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting splicing plays a role in establishing MAP levels. Two representatives were characterized and found to regulate map alternative splicing. This study provides a comprehensive view of factors modulating R-MAP signaling in Dila, indicating pathway output relies not solely on classical events, such as RAF activation, but also MAP regulation. Additionally, splicing components can impact alternative splicing.
A study was conducted to investigate the genetic diversity of Cryptococcus neoformans/C gatt species in Thailand, analyzing 498 isolates from clinical, environmental, and veterinary sources. The majority (68.9%) were from males, aged 37.97 years, with 88.5% of C neoans and 37.5 of gatt from HIV patients. U5-RP and M PCR fingerprinting revealed 94.8% of isolates were C neoans type V, regardless of source. Multilocus Sequence (ML) analysis identified 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand, with ST30 gatt and ST82,83,137,141,172,173 neoans unique. Most gatt isolates were STII, identical to the virulent Vancouver outbreak strain, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone for global spread. The study found greater diversity and range of molecular types amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. C neoans was common in HIV patients, while gatt in immunocompet patients, consistent with global studies. Environmental and veterinary sampling would help fill gaps. Despite HIV treatment, cryptoccos remains a major opportunistic infection in Thailand, further studies on epidemiology and virulence necessary for management.
Researchers investigated the role of transcription factor (TF) variation in the evolution of regulatory networks across 12 Drosophila species over 45 million years. They focused on the largest class of metazoan TFs, C2-H2 zinc finger (CH-Z TFs, and found that a significant fraction of CH-Z 1-1 orthologs exhibit variations affecting DNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and gain of CH-Z domains, diverging DNA-contact residues were found in 44% of shared between D melanogaster and other species. These diverging residues, found in 70% of D melanaster CH-Z genes and 26% all annotated melan TFs, showed evidence of constraint, being conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolving slower than diverging residues. Variations were rarely found as polymorphisms in a D melanaster population, indicating rapid fixation. Predicted specificities of these domains changed across phylogen distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Proteins with conserved CH domains were enriched in developmental functions, while varying domains showed no enrichments. The study suggests a subset of dynamic and understudied TFs are a source of regulatory variation in Dophila and metazoa.
Researchers have developed a new PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay to detect and differentiate between Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paraty A, the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. These serotypes are difficult to diagnose due to the lack of typing sera in some cases and the need for culture. The new assay targets a family of DNA sequences called CRIS (clustered regularly interspaced palindrom repeats) that are specific to each serotype. The conventional multiplex PCR and EvaGreen real-time PCR assays were validated on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 ser Paraty A strains from diverse origins and time periods, and 70 strains of other bacteria including 29 Salmonella and 38 other species. The assays showed 100% sensitivity and specificity. The CRIS targets can be used to develop assays for clinical samples with modifications. The serotype PCRs facilitate rapid and accurate identification in clinical and public laboratories with PCR access. A unique conserved region of the Salmonella genome was identified for each serotype, demonstrating stability and specificity in a large collection of strains. CRPR regions can be used for specific PCR development of Salmonella serotypes with unique spacers.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells during infection with Leishmania major, a protozoan parasite. Notch receptors Not1 and Not2 are expressed on CD4 T cells, but their implication in Th1 differentiation is not well understood. Mice with T-cell specific deletion of Not1, Not2 or both (Not2CD4) were infected with Leish major. Not2CD mice on C57/6 background developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia, correlating with impaired IFN secretion by lymph node CD T cells and increased IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines. Single inactivation of Not1 or Not in T cells was resistant to infection and developed a Th1 response, showing CD T expression of Not or Not is redundant in Th differentiation. Not signaling is required for IF secretion by Th cells, independent of CSL/RBP, major effector of Not, since infected mice with R deletion in T were able to develop IF Th cells, kill parasites and heal lesions.
A study investigated whether pre-existing Schistosoma mansoni infection increases susceptibility to systemic SHIV C infection in rhes macaques after mucosal exposure. Two groups of rhes macques, one infected with the parasitic worm and the other not, were challenged with decreasing doses of R-tropic clade C simian immunodeficiency virus (SH-C). Systemic infection occurred in parasitized rhes at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts, with a 50% infectious dose 17-fold lower in parasitized compared to controls (P < 0.001). Coinfected rhes had higher peak viral loads than controls (P < 0.001) and increased viral replication in CD4 central cells (P = 0.03). This is the first evidence that schosomias significantly increases risk of de novo virus acquisition, suggesting control of helth infections may be a public health intervention to decrease HIV-1 spread.
A biophysical model of cortical cholinergic modulation demonstrates how changes in neural excitability and network structure create distinct functional regimes: localized, asynchronous, traveling, and synchronous. These regimes qualitatively match experimentally observed cortical activity during slow wave sleep (SWS), REM, and waking states. During SWS, traveling patterns of activity occur in the cortex, while in other states, stationary patterns do. The model consists of Hodgkin-Hux type neurons with M-current regulated by acetylcholine (ACh). Regulation of ACh level accounts for dynamical changes between regimes. Reduction of this current recreates reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and shift from type 2 to type 1 phase response curve (PRC) observed in presence of A. When FA is minimal (waking or REM state, high A), patterns are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. When FA is present (decreasing A), traveling of activity arise. Further decrease A leads to high synchrony within waves. The level of A determines network sensitivity to heterogeneity. These regimes have functional significance: stationary may encode external input as memory, while traveling could lead to regularization. Experiments show in vivo stimulation cholinergic induces transition from WS to REM activity. Low ACh in model creates waves of high frequency states and quiet down, reminiscent of SWS. EEG analysis identifies slow S as traveling from frontal to posterior. Our results indicate large spatio-temporal dynamics by A mediated S and networks highly excitable responsive to heterogene.
Researchers investigated the impact of mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway on the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). They analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and found that non-synonymous mutations affected the TLR pathway in 25/171 (14.6%) of tumors. TLR mutant cases were associated with more proximal and metastatic disease, indicating clinical significance of these mutations. Rare mutations were identified in Barrett's esophagus samples. The findings were validated in an external EAC dataset with non-syn TLR pathway mutations in 33/149 (22.1%) tumors. TLR4 was the most mutated gene with eleven in 10/171 (5.8%) E tumors. TLR mutants E439, S, I, F, and R were confirmed to have impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide with marked in luciferase reporter assays. The study suggests that TLR genes are recurrently mutated in E and TLR mutations may play a role in disease in a subset of patients.
Researchers investigated the role of Hes in taste cell differentiation in mice by combining in silico and in vivo analyses. They found that Hes colocalized with taste receptor molecules (TRMs) in developing circumvallate papillae (CVP) and used computational analysis to identify Hes as a common regulatory factor for TRM transcription. Expression analyses revealed decreased nuclear Hes correlated with type II taste cell markers. Hes−/− mutants displayed over 5-fold more TRM-immunactive cells than wild-type littermates. The study suggests Hes plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing buds.
Researchers investigated the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling root development, a process distinct from dicot Arabidopsis. They found that transcriptional activation of OsIL on YUC8RE7 and indole-3-pyric acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using a YUC activity inhibitor, which regulates auxin biosynthesis via conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), they showed ethylene-inhibited primary root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis. A rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein-1, was identified with Y8RE7 truncated at its C-terminus, resulting in reduced auxin biosynthesis and enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots. Y8RE catalyzed IPA to IAA conversion, with C-terminal truncation reducing enzymatic activity, indicating YRE is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and eth-inhibited elong in rice seedlings. Ethylene induced YRE expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots, while low IAA rescued eth response in rein-1, demonstrating eth-in elong depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed YRE-mediated aux biosynthesis functions downstream of OsIL, directly activating YRE expression.
A nationwide epidemiological study in Saudi Arabia investigated the trend of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NT) diseases, which are reportedly increasing globally. The study collected 527 isolates over 24 months and identified 34 NT species, including 17 rare ones, with M. simiae (22.6%), M. fortuitum (18.1%), and M. absus (17.8%) being predominant. New cases of M. riyense, a rare species, were also found. The study showed rare events like mycobacteremia, abscess, peritonitis, and ascites caused by M. wolii, M. hatic, M. duii, and M. monence. Diabetes and previous tuberculosis history were risk factors associated with NT diseases. NT disease and pathogen diversity is a challenge in Saudi Arabia. A plan for mycobacterial control is needed. Globally, pulmonary and extrapul infections by NT are increasing, despite immunosup illnesses being a major factor. NT diseases are not considered a public threat, but neglected. Isolates were identified using probe assays and sequencing of 16S rRNA, 16-23 ITS, rpo, and h65 genes. 75.1% isolates were pulmonary with 44.7% clinical significance. 76.5% were Saudi citizens, 34.2% elderly, and 65.3 male.
Yeast cells enter a quiescent state when starved of glucose or other macronutrients, acquiring characteristics similar to those of quiescent cells. The molecular determinants of quies entry and lifespan are not well understood. Using starvation-specific reporters, a subset of the yeast deletion library encoding signaling proteins was screened. Apart from previously characterized Rim15, Mck, and Yak1 kinases, the SNF/AMP complex, cell integrity, and cell cycle regulators were necessary for quies establishment and extension of chronological lifespan (CLS). Quies requires integration of starvation signals via multiple pathways. CL of mutants and single, double, and triple mutants of Rim, Yak, and Mck correlates with carbohydrate accumulation but not cell cycle status. Removal of glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes, especially GSY and T1, abolishes accumulation and severely reduces CL. Overexpression of G2 and T1 or supplementation of trehal to medium ameliorates CL defects of mutants. Yak, Rim, and Mck kinases mediate TOR-regulated accumulation and CL extension. Data support metabolic reprogramming to accumulate energy and antioxidant systems are coordinated by Yak, Rim, and Mck to ensure quies entry and lifespan.
Researchers have discovered that the influenza A virus's hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation plays a crucial role in compensating for fitness defects resulting from escape from anti-HA neutralizing antibodies. By using a method of error-correct viral sequencing, they found that antigen-free propagation selected viruses with mutations that modulated receptor binding avidity through the addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain. This suggests that glycosylation can increase the fitness of antigenic escape variants by restoring optimal receptor interactions, even in the absence of antibody pressure. The study expands understanding of viral mechanisms maintaining fitness during antigen evolution, including glycan addition, and highlights the power of high-definition virus sequencing in revealing novel adaptive mechanisms. The findings indicate that glycos can play a role in compensating for antigenic novelty and transmissibility, a proposed explanation for the discord between high mutation rates and Ab selection in vitro and slow population evolution in vivo.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of ventricular myocyte models to investigate the phenomenon of rate dependence, a property of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the cardiac action potential (AP). They simulated populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzed results to predict rate-dependent effects on multiple parameters, testing 40 parameters in each model at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates. The study identified various forward rate-dependent (FR) ionic perturbations and specific mechanisms, such as an increase in L-type calcium current FR accompanied by indirect rate-dependent changes in delayed rectifier potassium current. Inward rectifier potassium and sodium-potassium currents were found to be the most likely to produce FR prolongation. Statistical analysis showed models with minimal rate changes in AP shape have little FR potential, while those with large changes have considerable FR. This explains differences between species and ventricular types. The study provides insights into determinants of AP duration dependence and a strategy for designing beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs.
Researchers developed a new method to perform Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PAS) based on ICD-10 codes and biological test results, using a quantitative trait as a criterion. They applied this approach to thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated with thiopine drugs. Two methods for ICD-10 code aggregation were developed: ICD-10 hierarchy and mapping to existing ICD-9-CM PheAS codes. Eleven biological results were analyzed using discretization algorithms. Data from a French hospital's clinical warehouse between 2000 and 2013 were analyzed, with 442 records representing 10,252 ICD codes and 71,711 test results. Concordance between I-9M PheAS and I-10 codes validated phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with high TP activity (p=0.0004 and p=0.001, respectively). This is the first PheAS using I-10 classification, previously published PheAS were based on I-9-C. Temporal data for thiopine prescriptions and TP assays were considered, restricting analysis to events after initiation. Biological results validated phenotypes from I codes. A method to perform PheAS on quantitative trait using I-10 codes and test was developed, identifying associated phenotypes in pharmacogenomics.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies on stem cell transplantation in spinal cord injury found that allogenic stem cell treatment improved motor function by 27.2% (95% CI 25.0-29.4) in 5,628 animals and sensory function by 26.3% (95 CI 7.9-44.7) in 473 animals. Heterogeneity between experiments was mainly due to stem cell biology, differentiation, implantation route, and delivery method. Stem cell implantation did not improve sensory outcome in females and was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. A dose-response relationship supported biological plausibility. For motor outcome, heterogeneity was due to experimental design and outcome measure. Location, injury method, and immunosuppression impacted results. Reporting bias was higher than in neuroscience but still suboptimal. Motor studies without blinded outcome assessment gave inflated efficacy. Extensive preclinical literature suggests stem-cell therapies may offer promise, but internal validity and bias likely lower efficacy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the patterns and dynamics of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) reinfection after treatment. The review included 154 studies, with 51 providing STH rates pre- and post-treatment and 42 determinants of predisposition to reinfection. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, Ascaris lumbricoid prevalence reached 26% (95% CI: 16-43), 68 (95% CI 60-76), and 94 (95 CI 88-100) of pretreatment levels, respectively. Trichuris trura reinfection prevalence were 36 (95 CI 28-47), 67 ( CI 42-100), and 82 ( CI 62-100), and hookworm 30 ( CI 26-34), 55 CI 34-87, and 57 CI 49. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were correlated with pretreatment status. S reinfections occurred rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoid and T. trura. Frequent anthelmint drug administrations are needed to maximize benefit of preventive chemotherapy. Integrated approaches emphasizing health and sanitation are required to interrupt transmission of STH.
Researchers investigated the deregulation of metabolic processes in nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) using a new method called Minimum Enrichment Analysis (MiA) applied to mouse and human omics data. NAD is a spectrum of diseases from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Traditional pathway analysis requires predefined maps, which can be biased due to different annotations and cannot capture complex interactions. MiA generates minimal networks (Mi) of reactions for a target metabolite from genome-scale metabolic (G) networks. The authors applied MiA to deregulated Mi and identified key regulators in NAD phenotypes, such as fatty liver and inflammation in humans and mice. Key deregulations were found in cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and hexadecate synthesis, and regulators of hydrogen peroxide synthesis differed between humans and mice. Specific Mi demonstrated characteristics of NAD phenotypes were identified. MiA is applicable to any G and target metabolite, making it flexible for studying metabolism in any disease or organism.
A model of primacy coding, where the identity of an odor is encoded by the types of receptors that respond earliest, provides a compact and informative representation that can be efficiently interpreted by the brain. Numerical simulations and statistical analysis show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types in the prim representation, but weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of odor intensity and the information is useful for performing olfactory tasks close to experimentally measured. Interestingly, smaller receptor repertoires can be advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests that overly sensitive receptors can dominate the response and make the array useless, allowing prediction of receptor adaptation to environmental changes. Primacy is more useful than binary and normalized coding as the sparsity of representations is independent of odor statistics, unlike alternatives. It provides an efficient representation independent of intensity and helps identify odors in olfactory cortex.
Researchers investigated the neutralization profiles of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMA) targeting different regions of the HIV envelope (Env) protein. They found that bnMA targeting the V2 apex and gp41 regions of Env were more likely to display non-sigmoid neutralization curves with plateaus below 100% neutralization, while those targeting the high-mann patch were less likely to do so. CD4 binding antibodies also showed this behavior infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was observed in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell-grown virus panel derived from patient samples. Additionally, bnMA were tested against a panel of molecular clones produced in 293 cells and PBMC and assayed in TZ-bl cells, with examples of plateaus below 90% seen in both types of virus with no consistent patterns. The study suggests that incomplete neutralization and nonigmoid neutral curves are possible for all bnMA against a range of viruses produced and assayed in cell and primary cells, with implications for use in therapy and vaccine design.
Researchers developed a computational model of human metabolism to investigate how cancer cells utilize glucose and glutamine to produce energy and biomass. They simulated various scenarios with different glucose and glutamine uptake rates and found that in a subset of proliferating cells, glucose was converted to lactate even in the presence of oxygen. High glutamine utilization decreased glucose oxidation and increased lactate production from glutamine when oxygen was limited. This metabolic pattern was optimal for biomass and ATP production, requiring a branched TCA cycle and glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation for lipid and protein production, sustained by redox-controlled reactions. Experimental validation in a K-ras cell line showed glutamine-induced metabolic changes consistent with the model. The findings suggest a metabolic reprogramming underlying cancer growth, where competition between glucose and glutamine may play a role. The Warburg effect, aerobic glycolysis, and glutamine utilization are hallmarks of cancer cell growth. A constraint-based approach was used to evaluate metabolic wirings for biomass formation from glucose and glutamine under varying conditions. The study identified conditions promoting cancer metabolic rewiring, where glucose is redirected to lactate in the presence of oxygen. Glutamine utilization decreased glucose oxidation and increased lactate production from glutamine when oxygen was limited. This pattern was optimal for biomass and ATP production, requiring branched TCA and glutamine reductive carboxylation for lipid and protein production, sustained by redox reactions.
Researchers investigated the interactions of the prion protein (Pr) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel (PrPnd) and Shadoo (Spr), in a cell culture model permissive to prion replication. They found that the three prion family members populate similar molecular environments in neuroblastoma cells and interact with each other. Direct interactions were confirmed between Pr and the neural adhesion molecule lamin, Na+/K-ATPase, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI), reconciling previous findings. Experiments showed Pr interactions with PDIs extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and may play a role in PrSc accumulation. A hypothesis proposes that Pr organizes its environment through binding adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, recognizing oligann-bearing membrane proteins. The study suggests biochemical interactions among prion family members exist.
During influenza virus infection, a type 1 pro-inflammatory cytokine response is typically induced, but type 2 cytokines are also produced. Type 2 cytokines are linked to asthma exacerbation, but may also provide protection. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a type 2 cytokine essential for eosinophil maturation and egress from the bone marrow. In a mouse model of influenza infection, IL-5 was released into the airways and eosin accumulated in the lungs, particularly during recovery. The source of IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in the infected lungs. IL-5 production by IL2 was enhanced by interaction with NKT cells and alveolar macrophages (AM), which produced IL-33. This interaction led to abundant IL-5 production by IL2 and eosin accumulation during recovery. IL-5 was previously reported in the lungs during IAV infection, with a peak release at 4-8 days post-infection. In this study, IL-5 was detected in bronchoalveolar lavage at 4 days post-infection, peaking at 7 days post-infection. IL-5 is essential for eosin generation and egress, and local production in the lungs can cause eosinophilia, exacerbating asthma. IL-5 continued to be produced during recovery, responsible for eosin accumulation.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NT) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of NT disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively identified 102 cases of NT infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. Clinical records were accessed to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with NT infection and identify risk factors with death. Multi-locus typing and antimicrobial testing was performed on all organisms. 71% of NT patients were HIV-infected, 90% were adults, 71 were male, and 33 reported intravenous use. 26/92 (28) patients had known outcome; HIV was associated with death (p=0.039). Enteridis Sequence (ST) 11 and Typhimium (ST 19, 34, 154) were the most identified serovars. Tyim was more common in HIV-infected (p=0.003). Isolates from HIV-inf patients exhibited reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamox than HIV-negative (p=0.037). NT disease is severe in Vietnam with high mortality. In sub-Saharan, HIV was factor for death, majority burden in population HIV-inf adult.
Researchers have developed a method using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to identify viral and phage structural proteins, which are crucial for the survival and pathogenicity of viruses. These proteins are difficult to detect due to low sequence conservation, few conserved catalytic sites, and limited data. The ANNs were trained on amino acid frequencies and correctly classified a large fraction of test cases with high specificity and sensitivity. Adding protein isoelectric point as a feature improved accuracy, especially for major capsid and tail proteins. Electron microscopy validated predicted proteins with no similarities to known sequences self-assembled into virion structures. The ANNs are a new tool for identifying phage and prophage proteins difficult to detect by bioinformatic analysis. They will be valuable when in vitro propagation is not practical or possible.
Researchers have identified a protein called interferon-stimulated gene oligoadyl synthase-like (OAS) as an interaction partner of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSH) protein ORF20. ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle were not well understood. Three isoforms of OR20 were localized in the nuclei and nucleoli of transfected cells. Quantitative purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) identified specific partners of OR20, including ribosomal proteins and AS. Both endogenous and transiently transfected AS co-immunipitated OR20, and this interaction was conserved among OR20 isoforms and OR20 homologs in other herpesviruses. Characterization of AS interacting partners by q-APMS identified a similar interactome to OR20. OR20 and AS copurified with 40 and 60 ribosomal subunits and associated with polysomes. OR20 did not have a global effect on translation, but enhanced RIG-induced expression of endogenous AS in an IR3-dependent but IFN-independent manner. AS has antiv activity against some viruses, but its role in gammaherpesviruses was unknown. OR20 and AS expression were induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuLT-rSH.219 cells. Intriguingly, AS enhanced KSH infection. During KSH OR20 mutant, AS-dependent infectivity was lost.
A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. A total of 913 feile children aged 1-15 years were admitted to the Children's Emergency of Irrua Teaching Hospital over a year. 373 (40.9%) had fever, of which 108 (29%) presented with convuls. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%; 95% CI 1.9,5%) in feile admissions, 3/108 (2.8%) in Cases and 10/265 (3.8) in Controls. The odds ratio of LVD in Cases versus Controls was 0.73 (95 CI 0.2,2). Only vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with increased prevalence of L. L is an important cause of undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas but not associated with convuls in feile children. Its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation underscores the importance of high suspicion in diagnosis. Screening feile with undifferent fever in endemic for L could be an important public health measure.
Researchers investigated the role of the karri receptor KINSENSITIVE2 (KAI) in drought resistance in Arabidopsis thalian. They found that mutations in the KAI gene result in hypersensitivity to water deprivation, leading to increased water loss, cell damage, and stomatal aperture, and cuticular permeability. Transcriptomic and biochemical analyses revealed reduced anthocyan biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) in K2 plants. Genome-wide analysis identified genes associated with these changes, suggesting crosstalk between ABA and KAI signaling in drought responses. Comparison with strigolone receptor mutant d14 (DWAR14) indicated strigones also contribute to drought adaptation, but not through cuticle development. The study suggests chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI and D signaling may improve drought resistance. K2 is activated by binding KAR or an unknown ligand, regulating downstream genes in cuticle, stomatal, anthyan biosynthesis, and membrane integrity, contributing to drought adaptation.
Researchers have investigated the role of insulin signaling in the growth and development of Schistosoma japonicum, a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans. They focused on the insulin receptors (SIR) of S. japonicum, which they had previously cloned and characterized. Using a technique called biolayer interferometry, they showed that human insulin binds to the L subdomain of recombinant SIR1 and SIR2 produced in Drosophila cells. They then used RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of SIR in S. japon in vitro and found that, in addition to reduced transcription, the levels of other downstream genes in the insulin pathway associated with glucose metabolism and schosome fecundity were impacted. A significant decrease in glucose uptake was observed in SIR-knockdown worms compared to lucase controls. In vaccine challenge experiments, recombinant SLD and SLD depressed growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal production in S. japon in mice with low challenge. These results emphasize the potential of SIR as vaccine candidates against zoonotic schosomiasis in China and the Philippines.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a significant cause of disability in the Pacific region, affecting over 96% of the 1.7 million population at risk of infection. Mass drug administration (MDA) has reduced lymphatic filariasis prevalence, but vector biology complicates the MD strategy in some regions. Obligate mosquitoes provide targets for breaking the LF cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, in the South. Researchers demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in Aedes aegypt (CP strain) stably infected with endosymbiotic Wolbachia from Aedes albopictus. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays show CP males are competitive, resulting in population elimination when introduced into wild Aedes aegpt populations. The findings demonstrate feasibility and encourage field tests of the vector strategy as a supplement to ongoing MD efforts.
A study was conducted in Uram District, Tanzania to estimate the burden of Rhodesian trypanosomiasis (HAT) in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and financial costs. Data from 143 patients admitted to Kali Health Centre in 2004 for HAT treatment were analyzed. Direct and indirect costs incurred by patients and health services were calculated. DALs were estimated using the Global Burden Project methods and previous H estimates, assuming 45% under-reporting. The DALs for H in Uram District without and with weighting were 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95% CI 209.1-362.6) respectively. With 45% underreporting, results were 622.5 (95 CI 155.3-109.9) and 978.9 (95 CI 201.1-187.8). The cost of treating 143 patients was $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and services $11,841. Indirect non-medical costs for 143 were $9,781. The study shows H imposes a significant burden on rural communities in Tanzania, highlighting the need for location-specific estimates in settings like Tanzania where diseases are focal and concentrated. The re-emergence of H in Uram continues to burden health systems and communities. The study used hospital records and estimated underreporting T. b. rhodesi H in the district. The disease is neglected and not a priority in endemic districts. This is the first H assessment for Tanzania and second for Africa. Previous studies on neglected diseases and zoon have been conducted in Tanzania, including brucellos, showing high burden on health and communities.
Researchers studied mice with a genetic mutation in the Ngly gene, which codes for a de-glycosylating enzyme Ng1, and found that they were embryonically lethal in C57/BL6 background. However, deleting the Eng gene, which codes for another de-glycosylating enzyme that leaves GlcNAc at glycosylated Asn residues, partially rescued the lethality of Ng1-deficient mice. Additionally, changing the genetic background of C57/BL6 mice by crossing with an outbred ICR mice also partially rescued embryonic lethality of Ng1-deficient mice. Viable Ng1-deficient mice in C57/6 and ICR background showed a severe phenotype reminiscent of symptoms of Ng1-deficiency, which were strongly suppressed by deleting Eng in C57/6 and ICR background. Defects in Ng1/Eng-deficient C57/6 and Ng1-def C57 and ICR mice resembled symptoms of patients with Ng-deficiency. These findings suggest Ng1 or Ng1/Eng-deficient mice as valuable models for studying pathogenesis of Ng-def and cytoplasmic ENG as a potential therapeutic target for this disorder. The lethality of Ng1-def mice was mainly due to de-glycosylation function, as it was partially suppressed by deleting Eng. The study characterized the function of Ng gene in mice, consistent with reports on Ng-def human subjects. The lethality of Ng1 mice was partially rescued by deleting Eng or changing genetic background.
Researchers studied how the gene expression of the hunch (hb) gene in fruit fly (Drosophila) embryos is controlled by a maternal gradient of the Boid (B) protein. Gene expression is subject to noise, which can produce variability, but this must be constrained for reproducible and coordinated development. They characterized the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output on promoter structure and transcription dynamics using a model of the hb promoter with variable B and self-regulatory binding sites. Parameters were fit to data from wild-type, self-regulatory mutant, and lacZ reporter constructs. Results indicate that wild-type self-regulatory hb noise is dependent on transcription and translation dynamics, not B fluctuations. Constructs lacking self-regulation show that multiple B binding sites in the promoter play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to variation in B binding site number across species. This study identifies ways promoter structure and dynamics reduce noise, applicable to many genes with multiple sites, cooperativity, and self-feedback. The results contribute to understanding of reproducibility and determinacy in early development.
Researchers have quantified the strength of selection against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans by developing a novel method to estimate genome-wide strength and density of selected sites using Neander allele frequencies in modern human genomes. They found that East Asians had higher initial Neander ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The bulk of purifying selection against Neander ancestry is attributed to weakly deleterious alleles, which were effectively neutral in Neander but became selected against in humans due to larger population size. These alleles imposed a heavy genetic load on early human-Neander hybrids. The study suggests effective population size plays a significant role in shaping introgression levels, more than previously thought. The approach is one of the first to estimate strength of selection against autosomal Neander alleles in anatomically modern humans. The results enhance understanding of selection's impact on Neander contribution to human genomes and shed light on Neander-human hybridization. Patterns of Neander ancestry in humans are consistent with genome-wide purifying selection of weakly deleterious alleles. The bulk of selection against Neander may be due to accumulation of neutral alleles in Neander, purged by selection in humans due to larger population size. Weakly deleterious alleles in Neander had a profound effect on Neander introgression levels. The study suggests differences in population size and neutral dynamics determine introgression levels across species and genome.
Researchers have investigated the control of stochastic gene expression by host factors at the HIV promoter, specifically the long terminal repeat (LTR), which orchestrates various aspects of the viral life cycle, including gene expression and replication, and establishment of a latent state. In a model of HIV-1 provirus, L-GFPRESat, bimodal gene expression is dynamic, with cells switching between active (Bright) and inactive (Off) modes, contributing to establishment and maintenance of proviral latency. The HIV promoter contains cis-acting Sp and NF-κ elements that regulate expression via recruitment of activating and repress complexes. Mutations in Sp and NF-κ elements were introduced in lentivirus variants, and flow cytometry, mRNA quantification, pharmacological perturbations, and chromatin immunoprecitation revealed significant differences in contributions to viral regulation. Sp sites stabilize both Bright and Off states, promoting gene expression and histone acetylation deacetylation. NF-κ sites exhibit distinct properties, with κ site serving a stronger role than site II. Sp site plays a role in recruitment of p300 and Rel to promoter. Analysis of 362 clonal cell populations with variants showed mutations in Sp sites yield 6-fold higher frequency of clonal bifcation compared to wild-type. Each Sp and NFκ site differentially contribute to regulation, Sp functionally "amp" transcription noise and modulate frequency and maintenance of viral latency.
A comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate the performance of 11 orthology projects and methods, including COG, KOG, Inparan, Ortho, Ensembl, Com, Homene, Round, EggNO, OMA, and two standard methods, bidirectional best and reciprocal distance, in terms of phylogenetic and functional analysis. The results showed that OMA and Homene performed best in phylogen tests and functional analysis with high specificity, while OrthoCL outperformed Ensembl and Inan at lower specificity but higher coverage. EggG provided the largest coverage for broad functional grouping but was not specific for phylogen or detailed analysis. In terms of methodology, Ensembl's complex reconciliation approach was outperformed by pairwise methods in phylogen tests, and bidirectional best-hit outperformed more complex algorithms. The study provides guidance for orthology users, introduces methodology for verification, and sets standards for current and future approaches. Phylogen tests showed OMA and Homene best performance, also in functional tests with high specificity. OrthoCL outperformed Ensembl and Inan at lower specificity but higher coverage. Egg provided largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories. The study compared 11 projects on both phylogen and functional definitions, obtaining consistent results for objective comparison.
Researchers have developed a computational drug repurposing pipeline to discover new therapeutics for schistosomiasis, a neglected disease caused by parasitic helmin infection. The current treatment, praziquel, is 40 years old and mass administration is leading to drug resistance. The pipeline used phenotyp screening to identify protein kinases as new targets, essential in parasite biological processes. Focusing on this class, the kinome of Schistoma japonicum was elucidated, and updated kinomes of S mansoni and haobium compared to the human kinome. Potential targets of existing inhibitors unique to Schos species were identified, suggesting novel and approved drugs that inhibit them, including bosutin, dasatin, imatinib, vetan, saratin, tidegl, alvid, dinlib, and 22 new targets CHK, CDC, WEE, PAK, ME1. Primary and secondary targets in Schos of approved drugs were also suggested for novel therapeutics development.
Researchers studied the folding and binding mechanism of the pID domain of the transcription factor CREB to the K domain of coactivator CB. Using a topology-based model, they predicted a coupled folding and binding mechanism with the existence of partially bound intermediates. Transition path and Φ-value analyses showed that the binding state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying CREB becomes structured after committing to binding. The change in structure following binding is reminiscent of an induced mechanism, contrasting with models where binding occurs to pre-structured conformations existing in the unbound state. Increasing the amount of structure in unbound pID reduced the rate of binding, suggesting a "fly-casting-like" process. Inclusion of non-native interactions formed non-specific complexes enhancing the rate of binding but not changing the mechanism. The study explains how unstructured can confer an advantage in target recognition. Simulations agree with a recent NMR study and aid interpretation of binding kinetics.
A systematic review was conducted to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) between 1942 and 2014. The study aimed to assess the progress towards the World Health Assembly's 2012 resolution to eliminate schistosomias by 2020. A total of 132 articles were included, providing 1242 prevalence and intensity data points, mostly from Brazil (69.7%). Studies published after 2000 showed 'hotspots' of high prevalence in Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia, requiring updated epidemiological status to redesign national programs. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up surveys are needed to verify status. Heterogeneity in methodologies made cross-national comparisons difficult. The burden of chronic infection may persist even in countries with eliminated transmission. Standardization of monitoring and evaluation is recommended, using WHO guidelines. Meeting the elimination goal requires improved epidemiological data by age and sex.
Researchers investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 viruses transmitted during heterosexual transmission by sequencing 167 full-length genomes and generating 40 infectious molecular clones from six transmission pairs. They found that transmitted/founder (TF) variants, selected during transmission, did not have increased replicative capacity or interferon resistance compared to non-transmitted (NT) variants from the same pairs. In vitro assays, TF variants did not show higher infectivity, replicative capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells or monocyte dendritic cells, or resistance to antiviral effects of interferon-α (IF-α) compared to NT variants. This suggests that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to immune responses reduces transmission potential. 

The study used single genome amplification to assess genetic selection during transmission and cloned TF along with NT variants to evaluate in vitro fitness, including particle infectivity, neutralizing antibody resistance, replicative capacity, and IF-α resistance. Unlike previous studies, this research examined full HIV-1 proteins from both partners and evaluated genetic and phenotypic signatures during transmission. HIV-1 transmission was not mediated by viruses with higher interferon resistance, indicating factors other than IF-α resistance determined fitness in these pairs. In vitro assays with exogenous IF-α, previous studies found subtype B and C TF variants resistant to IF-α compared to chronic or NT from same individual. This suggested selection during transmission for variants escaping innate immunity, specifically IF-α effects.
Lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling induced by filarial parasites have significant implications for the pathogenesis of lymphatic filariasis. In mouse models without an adaptive immune system, lymphatic dilation occurs due to filarial infection, but severe lymphedema and elephantiasis require an intact immune response in human infections. Human lymphatic endothelial cells exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected serum showed significant proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Live parasites or filarial antigens induced LEC proliferation and differentiation. Serum from microfilar positive patients and those with chronic lymphatic obstruction showed increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. Differentiation of L into tube-like structures was associated with increased matrix metalloproteases and TIM inhibitors. Gene expression by live parasites in LEC compared to parasite-exposed LEC showed filarial altered expression of genes involved in cellular organization and junction pathways, decreasing transendothelial transport. Filarial parasites directly induce lymphogenesis and differentiation, providing insight into lymphatic pathology in filariasis.
Researchers have developed a method to amplify and sequence the genome of a single bacterial cell using a microfluidic device with 60-nanol reactions. This technique, called Multiple Displacement Amplification (DA), eliminates the need for culturing the bacteria in a laboratory. The device isolates individual Escherichia coli cells and amplifies their genomic DNA in a small volume, reducing nonspecific synthesis from contaminant DNA and primer interactions. The quality of the amplification was assessed by qPCR and compared to standard 50-μl volumes, showing favorable results. Amplification bias was greatly reduced in nanol volumes, providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from both microl and nanol volumes provided high-quality data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing from single cells.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of hantavirus transmission in the Atlantic Forest biome, focusing on the role of rodent hosts and landscape structure. They analyzed 283 rodent capture records and used geographically weighted models to test predictors of havirus host proportions. Results showed that havirus host proportions were positively influenced by landscape diversity, not specific habitat or agricultural type. Local mammal diversity also positively correlated with pathogenic havirus host proportions, suggesting habitat quality may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarcane plantations increased rodent host proportion, while defaunation did not correlate with pathogenic havirus genotypes. The match between hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, coldspots 20%. Spatial land use influenced havirus hosts across the Atlantic Forest. Findings suggest disease surveillance should be reinforced in southern and southeastern regions with high host and vulnerability. Rodent community interactions with disease may be more complex than hypothesized.
Researchers investigated the role of BCL family proteins in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. They found that the survival of infected cells depends on BCL, a pro-survival B2 protein, due to suppression of the expression of another pro-surival protein M1. Treatment with BCL inhibitors or deficient BCL gene expression induced BAX/BA-dependent apoptosis upon flavivirus infection. Flivirus attenuated protein synthesis, leading to reduction of short-lived proteins like M1. Inhibition of BXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. The study also examined the role of BXL in death of JEV-infected cells in vivo. Deficiency of BXL or administration BH mimetic compounds increased survival after J infection and suppressed inflammation. Results suggest BXL plays a crucial role in survival of cells with flaviruses, and BXL may be an antiviral target to suppress Flavidae viruses.
A study estimated the economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam from 2005-2014, incorporating direct and indirect costs of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), dog vaccination, livestock losses, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs. Data from interviews, literature, reports, and primary collection were used. The total economic impact of canine rabies was $719 million over the 10-year period, with 92% being P-related costs. Canine rabies created 36,560-45,700 DALs and 914 human deaths were reported, with a rate of 0.11 deaths/100,000, lower than Asian countries. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75. Results indicate that rabies impacts in Vietnam are consistent with Asia, with large P expenditures and small investments in vaccination. 

The majority of rabies costs in Vietnam are associated with P and minimal with vaccination. Livestock losses are insignificant, but may be regionally significant. Comparing prevention and control measures, Vietnam is consistent with other Asian countries, spending more on P than preventing through vaccination. P compose 92% of burden while vaccination is 6%.
The Type II Secretion System (TSS) is a molecular machine responsible for secreting fully-folded substrates across the bacterial outer membrane. A key component of the machinery is the secretin, a multimeric outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. Researchers have identified three forms of TSS based on the characteristics of their secretin pores, with the Klebsella and Vibrio types being distinguished by the pilot protein that mediates transport and assembly into the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the novel pilot Asp from Vibrio cholera was determined, showing convergent evolution where Asp is functionally equivalent yet structurally unrelated to pilotins in Klebsella and other bacteria. Asp binds to a specific sequence in Vib-type secretins, enhancing secretin assembly, and homologs of Asp are found in Vibrio species and few Escheria Shella with Vib-type TSS. In Vibrio and Shella species with Vib-type TSS depend on Asp pilot to assemble a functional TSS. The correlation between Vib-type secretins, Asp-pilotins, and substrates in diverse bacteria may be due to acquisition of a complete secretin-pilot-substrate unit with the TSS operon. The structure of Asp shows no similarity to Pul-Out family proteins, but biochemical analysis demonstrates binding to S-domain in Vib-type secretins, distinguishing S-domains of Klei and Vib secretins.
Researchers have identified a protein, Omp37, on the surface of pathogenic Leptira bacteria that binds to human elastin, a protein found in skin and blood vessels. This binding is a crucial step in the bacteria's ability to adhere to and colonize host tissues during infection. The study used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to test the binding capacity of Omp36, O37, and O47 to various host components, and found that O37 binds to elastin with high affinity, as well as fibrin, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and laminin. The binding to elastin was enhanced by antibodies against O37, suggesting that the protein plays a role in the bacteria's attachment to elastin-rich tissues. O37 was also recognized by sera from patients with acute leptospi and infected hamsters. The protein was detected in pathogenic Leptira but not saprophytic Leptira, indicating its involvement in virulence. The researchers hypothesize that O37 facilitates the bacteria's initial attachment to skin through its strong affinity for elastin, a key step in the infection process. Further investigation is needed to understand the protein's role in virulence and the development of diagnostic and protective antigens for leptpi.
Researchers have developed a model to estimate the probability of broadly neutralizing antibodies 4E10 and 2F disabling the gp41 trimer after cell-HIV adhesion. These antibodies, isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external (MP) region of gp41, which are transiently exposed during viral entry. The model calculates the probability of an antibody disabling the epitope before fusion is complete, given the antibody concentration. When 4E or 2F bind the MP, a conformational change results in a stably bound complex. The model predicts that for these antibodies to be effective, the time to disable epitope must be shorter than the time bound in conformation, about five minutes or less for 4E and 2F. The study investigates the role of avidity in neutralization, showing 2F IgG is more effective than 4E, attributed to 2F interacting more stably with viral membrane. The model elucidates parameters determining ability to disable epitopes and extends to analyze neutralization data, predicting dependencies on antibody binding rate, fusion rate, and number of gp bridging virus and cell. Analysis indicates a small number of gp bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion.
A longitudinal study was conducted in three hyperendemic foci in Mali and Senegal to assess the effectiveness of 15-17 years of annual six-monthly ivermect treatment in controlling onchercias infection and transmission. The study aimed to determine if treatment could safely be stopped after 5 years. Skin snip surveys were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 people and 46,600 blackflies for Onocerca volulus larvae using a DNA probe. Results showed a declining infection and transmission trend after treatment, with two sites reaching zero microfilar and vector infectivity 3-4 years post-treatment. The third site, with high pre-treatment infection, showed a decline to low levels 3-5 years post-treatment. Infection and transmission indicators were below elimination thresholds. The study established proof-of-principle onocercias elimination with iverectin treatment in some African endemic foci. The results informed the shift from onercias control to elimination in Africa.
Researchers have investigated the role of the capsid protein VP4 in the entry of human rhinovirus, a non-envelop virus that causes the common cold, into cells. They produced a recombinant version of VP4 with a histidine tag and found it induced permeability in liposome membranes. Studies showed that VP4 forms a multimeric pore with a size consistent channel for single-stranded RNA transfer. The permeability was influenced by pH and similar to that induced by infectious virus. This provides a mechanism for VP's involvement in entry and a model for exploring it as an antiviral target for the picornavirus family. VP is myristoylated at its N-terminus, a feature of proteins with membrane binding properties. Previous studies showed VP's role in picavirus entry and membrane permeability, with mutations affecting virus ability to deliver genome into cells. This suggests VP as an antiral target for the family.
Francisella tularens (Ft) is a highly infectious, Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease classified as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human isolates of F. tularens produce lipid A similar to Francisella novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice. Researchers identified three enzymes required for lipid carbohydrate modifications: mannose (m1), galactamine (m2), or both (mK). Mutants lacking galactamine (m2) or galosamine/mannose (m) were attenuated in mice by pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. Aerosolization of mutants (m2 and mK) provided protection against wild-type (WT) Fn, while subcutaneous administration of mK provided protection from WT Fn. Infection of alveolar macrophage line by mK induced higher levels of tumor necrosis-α (TN-α) and macrophage inhibitory-2 (M-2) compared to WT Fn. Bone-derived macrophages (Bø) from Toll receptor (TLR) and TLR/4 knockout mice infected mK produced higher amounts of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and M-2 than Bø infected WT. However, production IL-6 and M-2 was undetectable in Bø from MyD- mice infected either. My- mice were susceptible to m infection. The ability of m to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chem production and innate responses mediated by My signaling may be responsible for attenuation, leading to induction of immunity by this mutant. Lipid of Francisella differs from classical enteric bacteria in structure and biological activities, with tetra-acyl chains of 16-18 carbons length and phosphate at 4 position removed by L phosphatase. This can be modified by addition galosamine onto 1-phosphate. Activation of innate system and induction pro-inflammatory via My-mediated were essential for clearance m and possibly protection.
Researchers investigated the role of Era, a ribosome-associated GTPase, in Staphylococcus aureus. Era is a conserved across domains of life and essential in many species, but its function in ribosome assembly is unclear. The study found Era is not essential for S. aureus growth, but important for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. Era interacts with 16S rRNA endonuclease Y and DEAD-box helicase C. Both Era and C are required for rRNA processing and growth at suboptimal temperatures. Era and C also interact with ppG synthase Rel, with Rel positively impacting Era's GTP activity but negatively affecting C's helicase activity. In its G-bound form, Era acts as a hub on the ribosome, directing enzymes in r processing and subunit assembly. The stringent response, induced by ppG, inhibits Era's activity, contributing to slowed growth phenotype. Era's interactions with Y and C are crucial for rRNA homeostasis and growth at low temperatures. Era and C also interact with pp synthase/hydrolase Rel, with rRNA processing controlled in stringent-dependent manner. The stringent response impacts RA-Gase function through Rel's interactions with Era and C. Era acts as a guide for r/rib maturation enzymes to substrates.
Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) induces vascular insufficiency in experimental animals through unknown mechanisms. This study shows that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) deficiency in mice causes strikingly increased sensitivity to LT, while deficiencies in other NOS enzymes (iN and eOS) have no effect on LT-mediated mortality. The increased sensitivity of N- mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin or cytokine responses and could be replicated in N-sufficient wild-type (WT) mice through pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme 7-nitindazole. Histological analyses showed LT induced changes in heart morphology of N- mice with rapid appearance of inter-fiber spaces but no apoptosis of cardiocytes. LT WT mice had no histopathology observed at light microscopy. Electron analyses of LT mice revealed pathological changes in hearts of both N and WT mice varying in severity and timing. Endothelial necrosis and degeneration, interocyte edema, myament degeneration, and sarcoplasmic reticulum alteration were observed in LT WT and N mice. Furthermore, biomarkers of cardiac injury myoglobin, cardiac troponin, and fatty acid protein were elevated in LT mice rapidly by 6 hours after injection and reached rarely in mice. Cardiac protective therapy and allopurin had no beneficial effects in LT mice. Surprisingly, nitric scavenger carbox-PT showed some protection against LT. Echocardi on LT mice indicated reduction in fraction following treatment in N and WT, indicative of contractile in heart. The heart is an early target of LT in mice and a protective role for N against cardiac damage.
Researchers have developed a method to introduce targeted gene disruptions in parasitic nematodes using CRISPR-C9. They used this method to disrupt the twitchin gene (unc-22) in the human parasitic worm Strongyloides stercalis, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. The mutations were heritable and passed through generations. A similar approach was used to disrupt the unc-22 gene in the rat parasitic nemode Strongyloides ratti. The study demonstrates the applicability of CRPR-C9 to parasitic nemodes, enabling future studies of gene function in medically relevant but previously intractable parasites.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to describe the effects of ribosome drop on translation and ribosome density along the mRNA. Ribosome drop is a phenomenon where ribosomes terminate prematurely during translation, affecting protein expression efficiency, particularly under stress conditions like amino acid starvation or high recombinant protein expression. The model shows ribosome termination leads to non-intuitive ribosome profiles, such as increased density from the 5' to 3' end. Importantly, it predicts ribosome drop's effects on translation are mRNA-specific and quantifies resilience to drop, showing mRNAs with ribosomes are less affected than those without. Among mRNAs without ribosomes, resilience to drop correlates with elongation rate, fast codons being less affected. Genome-wide analysis in S. cerevisiae reveals mRN coding proteins involved in translation machinery, using fast codons, are resilient to ribosome drop. In physiological conditions, mRN coding regulatory stress proteins are less resilient to ribosome drop. The model explains variations in translational efficiency by accounting for ribosome behaviors and mRNA variations in rib density from ribosome studies.
The World Health Organization's strategy to combat soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children is based on morbidity control through routine deworming of school and pre-school children. However, transmission persists due to reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment, necessitating continued deworming for extended periods or until socioeconomic and environmental conditions interrupt transmission. The feasibility of interrupting transmission using mass administration (MDA) is uncertain due to challenges in sustaining high coverage across communities. The DeW3 trial tests the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission, with three years of treatment followed by two years of surveillance. Given reinfection rates, a two-year treatment period is considered adequate to assess bounce or interruption. This study investigates criteria to determine interruption at earlier points. A stochastic individual-based model simulates De3 community cluster-randomized trial, comparing control (annual treatment of children with MDA) to intervention (community-wide biannual with M). Simulations were run for Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm (Necator american) at six months after last MDA and impact of M coverage to assess likelihood of bounce or elimination. Results suggest clusters should be assessed after two years unless interruption can be ruled out through low coverage. Models indicate homogeneous prevalence following high M across clusters do not allow discrimination between bounce or interruption within 24 months.
Researchers evaluated a conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholera O1 O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy fragment (Tc). Mice were immunized intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSP:Tc or OSP only, or with or without dmLT, a non-toxigen immunoadju derived from labile toxin Escheria coli. Significant IgG antibody responses to OSP were detected following single immunization in mice receiving OSP:Tc with or without adju. Anti-PS responses were detected following second immunization in these cohorts. No OSP or anti-PS responses were detected in animals receiving unjugated OSP or without immunju, and animals receiving immunju alone. Responses were highest in immun with adju. Serum-OSP and antiPS were detected in mice OSP:Tc with or withoutju, and unconjug OSP. antiPS and vibriodal responses were in all cohorts except immunju alone. No Ig antiOSP or antiPS developed any group. Administration OSPc and adju induced memory cell targeting OSP and 95% efficacy in mouse lethality cholera model. A protectively immunogenic cholera conjugate in mice is described. Development cholera conjug vaccine could induce long-term immunity, especially children poorly respond polysac antigens.
Researchers investigated the interaction between the fungus Candida albicans and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a neutropenic mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination. They found that Candida albicans inhibits the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by suppressing the expression of the pyelin and pyoverine genes, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. Deletion of the pyelin and pyine genes attenuated Pseudas virulence. Heat-killed Candida alb had no effect on Pseud, whereas Candida secreted proteins directly suppressed Pseud pyine and pyelin expression and inhibited Pseud virulence in mice. Interestingly, suppression or deletion of the pyelin and pyine genes had no effect on Pseud's ability to colonize the GI tract but decreased Pseud's cytotoxic effect on cultured colonocytes. Oral supplementation restored Pseud virulence in Pseud and Candida colonized mice. The findings provide insight into how bacterial-fungal interactions modulate bacterial virulence in the intestine, highlighting a novel mechanism of fungal inhibition of bacterial effectors critical for virulence but not colonization.
Researchers investigated the rate of reversion to wild-type (WT) virus from escape mutant (EM) virus in Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) and Simian/Human Immunodeficiency Virus (SHIV) infections. EM virus evades CD8+ T cell recognition and is often observed in HIV-1 and SIV infections, and is less replicatively fit compared to WT virus, as demonstrated by reversion to WT upon transmission to a naive host and association with lower viral load in vivo. The rate of reversion is highly variable. Researchers quantified reversion to WT of SIV and SHIV viruses containing minor amounts of WT in pig macaques using PCR. Infection with mixes of EM and WT containing ≥10% WT results in rapid outgrowth of WT at SIV G CD8 cell epitopes within 7 days of infection. In contrast, biologically passaged SH229 viruses with smaller proportions of WT or molecular pure EM239 demonstrated delayed or slow reversion. WT was detectable ≥8 days after inoculation and ≥ weeks to become dominant quasis. Delayed reversion associated with lower loads. The diversity of infecting inoculum determines timing reversion to WT, which predicts infection outcome. Delayed reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 cell escape suggests opportunities to reduce pathogenicity during early infection.
Researchers studied yeast populations from Evolution Canyon, Israel, and found that some strains exhibit high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. They discovered that cadmium resistance is primarily caused by enhanced function of the metal efflux pump PCA1. Molecular analysis showed that this enhancement is due to mutations in the promoter region, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Experiments demonstrated that single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA promoter quantitatively increase its activity and enhance cells' cadmium resistance. The critical nucleotides found in EC strains are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other species, suggesting they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides diverged in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, giving cells advantages under cadmium low or absent conditions. The study suggests a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by tradeoff metal resistance.
Researchers have identified three major oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer (GC) that are significantly related to patient survival: proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-caten. These pathways are deregulated in over 70% of gastric cancers. The study used an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic activation in 301 primary gastric cancers and functionally validated these predictions in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway showed reproducible and significant differences in survival in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions play a role in disease behavior. Gastric cancer can be taxonomized by oncogenic activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway by expression permits study of multiple pathways simultaneously in cancers at scale not achievable by other platforms.

The study developed an in sil method to map pathway activation in complex tumor profiles and validated pathway classification using breast cancer examples. The method was applied to eleven oncogenic pathways implicated in gastric carcinogenesis, including RAS, p53, BRCA, W/βaten, E, SRC, MYC, NFκ, histone deacetylation, and stem cell signatures. The strategy involves four steps: defining pathway signatures, mapping signatures onto cancer profiles, validating predictions, and applying to primary GC. Gastric cancer is the second cause global mortality, with most patients diagnosed advanced. Deregulation of oncogenic pathways such as E, KAS, p, and W/βaten occur in GC, indicating molecular heterogeneity.
Researchers used the concept of stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) to analyze the Escherichia coli K12 genome and found that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions known or inferred to contain promoters, but rarely in coding regions. They investigated whether genes in different functional categories have characteristic IDD in their upstream regions and found that strong IDD sites in E coli12 are statistically overrepresented in upstream of genes encoding transcription regulators, particularly those responding to physiological and environmental stimuli. If a pathway is controlled by a transcription regulator whose gene has a destabilized 5' flank, the genes (operons) in that pathway usually contain strongly destabilized IDD sites in 5' flanks. This association was observed in 38 of 43 free-living bacteria genomes but only 4 of 18 endosymbion or obligate parasitic bacteria. The study suggests IDD sites 5' to genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes known to alter superhelicity, proposing they are active participants in superically mediated mechanisms governing gene expression in response to physiological or environmental changes.
In the fungus Podospora anserina, a network of high-mob group (HMG) transcription factors regulates the sexual cycle, with 11 out of 12 HMG genes involved in this process. The HMG proteins are DNA-binding proteins characterized by the H-box motif and play crucial roles in genomic functions and control of genes in developmental and metabolic pathways. Systematic deletion analysis of uncharacterized HMG genes revealed none are essential for viability, but seven involved in sexual cycle. Two H-box display striking features: PaMG5, an ortholog of Ste11 from Schizosacomyces pombe, is a pivotal activator of mating-type genes in P. anina, whereas PaMG is a repressor of several specific to stationary phase, notably hyphal anoses. Transcription analysis of H-box in H-box strains indicated PaMG is the hub of a network of H-box that regulate mating-type and mating target genes. Genetic analysis revealed this network also controls fertility genes not by mating transcription factors. PaMG and Ste are conserved regulators of mating genes, although P and S diverged 550 million years ago. Two H-box, SOX and upstream S, play role in sex determination in mammals. P and S mating genes and upstream form a module H-box analogous S/SOX, revealing common sex regulation in animals and fungi.
During the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic, there was a lack of data on the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids and the risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. To address this, an observational study was implemented in Sierra Leone to determine the persistence of Ebola in survivors' body fluids. The study was conducted in two phases: the first phase assessed Ebola virus persistence in semen of 100 adult men within five months of protocol initiation, and the second phase evaluated persistence in multiple fluids (semenstrual, blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, tears) of 120 men and 120 women. Data informed national and global guidelines in real-time, demonstrating the need for semen testing among Ebola disease survivors. The study accelerated implementation of such programs in virus-affected countries and informed persistence of Zika virus studies. Research is crucial in responding to poorly characterized epidemics, with adequate resources needed to answer critical questions to inform efforts. Prior to the epidemic, data on Ebola virus persistence in survivors' body and transmission risks was limited, with World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control guidelines recommending abstinence or condom use for three months post-discharge. During the epidemic, clusters of sexual transmission from survivors occurred, leading to concern about virus transmission from semen and other fluids. The Sierra Ebola Virus Study commenced enrollment within five months of discussions and published baseline results within 10 months, leading to community and public demand for understanding EBO persistence after recovery.
Researchers have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments to study the chemotaxis sensory system in Escheria coli and predict the chemical gradients the bacteria encounter in their natural environment. By analyzing dose-response curves, they found that the cells typically experience exponential gradients, which lead to log-normal stimuli and maximal velocity. This is the first step in deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible microenvironments, such as the human intestine. The study used a multidisciplinary approach, combining information theory, simulations, and swimming measurements to show that maximizing information implies maximizing alignment of cell trajectories with the chemactic index and velocity. The chemaxis system has evolved to maintain perception in these gradients, as indicated by the Weber-Fech law, which focuses on perception changes in concentration as useful for the cell. To fully characterize the environment, the study matched statistical properties of stimuli to cellular responses, assuming optimization criteria. The chemaxis enables bacteria to detect and migrate in gradients of nutrients and toxins, with a simple system of few components well understood at the molecular level. The study connected phenomenological laws to information at the molecular level, showing a link between transmission and drift.
Researchers have investigated the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for the long-term supply of blood cells, and found that their lifespan varies among identical cells within the same animal exposed to the same environment. This raises the question of what controls the lifespan of HSCs. A new model based on reliability theory explains the diversity of lifespans of Hs using clonal repulation experiments and computational-mathematic modeling. The model shows that repulation failure of Hs is largely anti-persistent or mean-reverting processes, where failure rates increase during population division events and are counteracted by repair processes, leading to a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior. This crossover is due to an increase in mean failure rate of self-renew, leading to clonal extinction, suggesting Hs repair capacity is self-limiting. Lifespan of each H depends on amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in failure kinetics, with shorter and longer-lived Hs differing in pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations. This implies lifespan is determined by preprogrammed differences in repair capacity.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which antibodies prevent tissue damage caused by migrating helmin larvae. Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from chronic helmin infections, with no effective vaccines available. Antibodies and alternatively activated macrophages (AAM) play a crucial role in protective immunity against helmin infections. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these multicellular parasites were unclear. This study demonstrates that helmin-specific antibodies induce the trapping of migrating helmin larvae and prevent tissue damage following infection with the murine parasite Heligomosomoides polygyrus baker (Hp). Mice lacking antibodies (J−/−) or activating receptors (cγ/−) harbored highly motile larvae, developed tissue damage and accumulated Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around larvae. Antibodies with helmin larvae reprogrammed macroph to express wound-healing genes, including Arginase, and Argase product Lornine directly impaired larval motility. Antibody-induced Argase expression in vitro and in vivo occurred independently of IL-4α signaling. A novel IL-α-independent mechanism of macroage activation is antibody-dependent, mediating anti-helmin immunity and preventing tissue disruption by larvae. Macrophages were reprogrammed by helmin antibodies without IL-α signaling, indicating a novel pathway of macroage differentiation. Antibodies in helmin antigens elicited a subtype ILα-independent activated macroages, referred to as helmin-antib activated macroages (HAM).
Researchers have developed a new, non-invasive method to visualize DNA dynamics during the early stages of double-strand break (DSB) processing in living cells. This method, called ParBINT, uses oligomerization to form visible foci, allowing for real-time analysis of resection in single cells. By applying it to the HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, they provided the first-time analysis of resection in living cells. Monitoring the dynamics of chromatin next to DSB revealed transient confinement of damaged chromatin during early resection, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. Resection in y70 mutant began ∼10 minutes earlier than wild-type, defining the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. This new method will be applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome dynamics and function in normal and pathological contexts.
Researchers developed an epidemiological model to study the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, in humans. They aimed to estimate the frequency and timing of reinfections in people living in areas with active vector-borne transmission. Using a stochastic agent-based model, they analyzed data from Argentinean villages where 56% of humans were infected with different genotypes of T. cruzi. The model predicted 0.032 (0.008-0.042) annual reinfections per individual, with 98.4% occurring in the chronic phase. Parasites escaped the adaptive immune response in 20% of re-infections. Low reinfection rates were attributed to inefficient vector transmission rather than immune response. Estimated risks of reinfection during chronic disease were 14-18% and 21-70% after 5 and 30 years, with individuals reinfected 1-3 times. This study provides insights for vaccine development and understanding of chronic disease risk in endemic areas.
A study investigated the relationship between pre-existing immune responses to deng virus (DENV) and the outcome of subsequent infection in a cohort of Thai school-aged children. Blood samples were collected from children who experienced subclinical DENV infection or developed deng illness, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated in vitro with DENV to measure cytokine secretion. Significant differences were found in cytokine production based on the type of D used for stimulation and occurrence of illness. Secretion of IL-15 and MCP-1 was higher in PB of subjects who developed symptomatic D infection, while IL-6 was produced by PB from all who developed symptomatic versus 59% with subclinical. Secretion of IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, RANT, GM-CSF, and TNα was lower in PB from symptomatic subjects. These findings demonstrate differences in pre-existing responses to D associated with clinical outcome. Higher levels of some cytokines in symptomatic and higher of others in subclinical support existence of both protective and pathologic profiles. Clinical-immun correlations may be useful for evaluating responses to deng vaccines.
In the Drosila wing imaginal disc, Hedgehog (H) forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. However, a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and H concentrations has not been demonstrated. This study provides evidence that interpretation of H signaling depends on the history of exposure to H and proposes that a single concentration is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Mathematical modeling predicts that at steady state, only two domains can be in response to H, suggesting the boundaries of two or more gene patterns cannot be specified by a static H gradient. Computer simulations suggest a "overshoot" of the H gradient, a transient in which H is expanded compared to the H-state. Temporal examination of H target expression shows patterns expand initially and then refine, providing in vivo evidence for the overshoot. The H gene architecture suggests overshoot results from H-dependent upregulation of Patched (Ptc). Altering the network such that P is no longer upregulated in response to H-signaling, patterns of expression, distinct in wild-type discs now overlap. Results support a model where H gradient dynamics, from P upregulation, play an instructional role in establishment of patterns.
Researchers have identified a new mouse mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), which disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. eleg) unc-79 gene. Lwt/L homozygotes are perinatal lethal, while Lightweight heterozygotes are hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate a conserved sensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants, extending to related unc-80 and nca-1;n-2 mutants. Lightweight heterozyotes exhibit altered response to anesthetic isoflurane, similar to unc invertebrate mutant phenotypes. They are hyperactive in novel environments, smaller than wild-type, and have increased food consumption with lean body composition. Lightweight heterozyotes voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The hypersensitivity and increased ethanol consumption in Lightweight heterozy mice, combined with hypersensitivity in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and n-1;n-2 mutants, suggest a conserved pathway influencing alcohol behaviors in humans. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed absence of confounding mutations in the 1.4 Mb interval. Behavioral alterations in Lightweight heterozy to ethanol and anesthetics are qualitatively similar to C. eleg and Drosila, but differences exist. The dominant phenotype of Lightweight results from a nonsense mutation in the mouse unc-79 homolog. Heterozygotes are hyperactive and altered to ethanol inhaled anesthetics, consistent with conserved mammalian unc-79 function. C eleg-79, unc-80, and n-1;n-2 mutants are hypersensitive to acute ethanol, suggesting this pathway determines sensitivity in vertebrates.
Researchers have identified the Anopheles gambiae's immune response to Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria, as a potential source of anti-malaria mechanisms. One such mechanism is the Imd pathway, a conserved signaling pathway with anti-P. falcum activity. Silencing Cas, a negative regulator of Imd, or overexpressing REL2, an I-controlled NF-kappa transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae that involves immune effector genes. However, unexplored features of this mechanism are essential for malaria control implementation. Using RNA interference to silence Cas and Imd components, genes participating in anti-Plmod signaling regulated by Cas were identified, representing targets for pathway overactivation. Imd is potent against ookin stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser against lateocysts. Cas silencing alone induces robust anti-P response in absence of gut microbiota. Imd components TEP, APL, and LR1 in infection-dependent defense were established, shedding light on laboratory versus natural intensity models. Results highlight considerations for I pathway manipulation in A. gambia to limit malaria transmission and reveal nuances in I-directed response P. falcum.
Researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMs) in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis caused by Paroccidioides brasili infection. BMMs were isolated from BAL/c mice and administered intravenously to mice infected with P. brasili at 8 weeks post-infection. An additional group was treated with itraconazole (TC) two weeks before BSC administration. Animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks post-infection. Histological examination showed increased granulomatous areas in BSC-treated mice, with significant increases in fibrocy count, soluble collagen, and collagen-1, T-β, MMP-8, and MMP-15 expression. Combined therapy BSC/TC reduced TIM-1 and MMP-13 expression. Human fibroblasts stimulated with lung homogen from infected BSC-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression. The study found that BSC infusion did not have anti-frotic effect, possibly due to interaction with fungus promoting collagen expression and tissue remodeling. Treatment with TC alone or combined with BSC induced collagen expression in humanroblasts similar to non-treated mice. Soluble collagen was reduced in lungs of TC-treated and BSC mice. Lung homogen from infected and BSC-treated mice induced higher collagen expression in humanroblasts compared to non-treated mice.
A recent study investigated the seasonal dynamics of phlebotine sand fly species that transmit Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infant in the Mediterranean region. The study found that the expansion of these vectors in the area is attributed to climate change, and their activity is typically seasonal. Data from 2011-2013 entomological investigations in 8 countries provided a baseline for understanding of fly population dynamics that may impact future transmission scenarios. 99,000 specimens were collected, describing the seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies from 6 species: P. periciosus, P. aasi, P. neglect, P. tobi, P. balicus, and P. kaki. Time of fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, and densities varied. Significant correlations were found between latitude and annual temperature and first fly appearance (April-June) and density (July-August). A 3-modal trend was recorded for P. bi in Cyprus, a novel for L. infant vector. Adult activity ended September-November, without correlation with latitude and temperature. The period of exposure to L infant in the region, inferred from adult densities, was a bell-shaped curve with a peak July-September, and May-October for 99% values. No transmission risk occurred December-March. A nocturnal activity peaked 11-2 am, with annual variations. Multiple collections provided homogeneous patterns of behavior, proposing sentinel areas for monitoring. Higher risk L infant transmission June-October (97% density), but not equally distributed, with earlier and more frequent in southern territories.
Orientia tsutsamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that primarily infects endothelial cells, but also replicates in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. Microarray analysis revealed that O tsugamushi altered the expression of over 4,500 genes, with significant upregulation of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes and M1 macrophage polarization associated genes. Otsamushi induced apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. The type I interfer response and M-associated cytokines were indispensable to the transcriptional changes in mononuclear cells from patients with scrubus. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of 613 genes, including interfer-related and M polarization features in patients, similar to Otsamushi-stimulated monocytes in vitro. This is the first demonstration that monocytes are polarized in vitro and ex vivo following exposure to Otsamushi. The study improves understanding of scrubus pathogenesis, where interferon activation of monocytes and subsequent M1 polarization are critical. 

Otsamushi induced a specific M1 phenotype and type I IF response in monocytes, with sustained upregulation of inflammatory genes related to increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients. Type I and II IF and M signatures were found in PBs from patients with scrubus, suggesting association with inflammatory complications. Activated monocytes play a major role in pathogen dissemination, hypothesizing a similar phenomenon in scrubus. Oam upregulated expression genes in polarized responses, including IL-6, IL-12, IL-23, GM-CSF, and CCL20. Monocytes with live Oam produced IF-β, while heat-killed unable to produce IF-β, demonstrating live Oam induced sustained I response. Approximately 15% of upregulated genes were cytokines or chemokines. Oam upregulates type I pathway and apoptosis genes. In vitro results related to expression in patients scrubus, highlighting IF-mediated monocyte role in scrubus pathogenesis.
Researchers have investigated how ants use visual memory to navigate complex environments, focusing on the insect brain's mushroom body (MB) circuit, previously studied for olfactory tasks. A spiking model of the MB developed for fruit fly (Drosila melanogaster) olfactory learning was applied to desert ants (Catagis vel) route learning, demonstrating its ability to rapidly learn routes through natural environments. The model's key principles, including one-shot learning of sparse codes, enable the MB to store hundreds of images. 

A spiking model of Drosila MB olfactory learning was adapted for ant route memory, using realistic stimuli from field experiments. The focus was on visual route learning, not olfactory cues. The MB's neural architecture can form the basis for Badley's algorithm. The MB has been extensively studied in olfactory learning, crucial for insects. A spiking model of adultros MB olfactory used three stages: olfactory inputs produced a spatio-temporal pattern in antennal lobe, consistent with flies and ants. The MB implements the familiarity algorithm for route following in simulation, learning 80-route images from real ant habitats and distinguishing from similar off-route images. The network, developed for simple olfactory learning, required minimal modification for complex navigation. Ants and bees have enlarged MB compared to flies.
Researchers have developed a system to study how Arabidopsis thaliana plants respond to bacterial infection by shedding leaves as a defense mechanism. They infected Arabidopsis leaves with Pseudomonas syringae, a pathogen lacking a type III secretion system, which failed to elicit abission response, suggesting abission is triggered by effectors. Key genes HAESA/HA2, INFRESC, and NES are required for pathogen-triggered abission to occur. Plants with mutations in phytoalexin, disease susceptibility, salicylic induction, and senescence genes fail to abise leaves normally. Bacteria contacting abission zones trigger strong abission, but long-distance signals from infected tissue alert abission of danger. A model proposes a threshold regulating leaf defense where minor infections are contained, but when out of control, leaves are shed. Salicy acid regulates both pathogen and drought-triggered abission. 

A Pseudas syring pv tomato DC0 was used to infect Arabid leaves to understand defense mechanisms. The system builds on a well-studied pathosystem where roset leaves from non-flowering Arabid are infected. A new model for pathogen-trigger abission in Arabid is defined. The abission pathway regulates floral abission for all forms of inducible abission in Arabid. Previous work showed Arab leaves can be shed in response to drought. This study shows Arab uses abission as a defense against bacterial infection. Abission is robust and triggered by disease or ET. Defense and abission pathways are connected, multiple components necessary for pathogen abission. Salicy is necessary for full pathogen and drought abission.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of direction selectivity in starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina, which play a crucial role in detecting image motion. They found that SACs generate larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion is from their soma towards dendritic tips than in the opposite direction. To study this, they measured electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli via somatic whole-cell recordings and quantified using Fourier analysis. Fundamental and harmonic components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating nonlinearity. Harmonic amplitudes and potential relationship suggest voltage-gated channels activation. Ca2+ changes in SAC dendrites by voltage monitored by two-photon microscopy showed distal dendrite tonically depolarized relative to soma, due to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamgic input and high-voltage Ca+ channels. Compartment modeling concluded that dendritic DS in SAC can be computed by dendrites relying on voltageated channels and dendritic gradient, providing spatial asymmetry for direction discrimination.

The study used CF and CP wave stimuli to evoke DS somatic and dendritic Ca+ responses. Dendritic Ca+ responses were seen in a minority of cells, while electrical responses were present in all. Inhibitory blockers showed DS can be generated by dend-intrinsic mechanism, independent of lateral interactions. Blocking GABA, GABA, and glycine receptors was required to block dendritic Ca+ signals, indicating GABA and glycine lateral inhibition contributes to DS SAC. Pharmacological data showed DS persists when GABA receptor connections are blocked, indicating SAC generate DS by themselves. VGC, Ca channels and dendritic gradient are involved. Optical recordings showed strongest Ca+ increases in distal dendrites near synapses.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the mechanisms of pathogenesis, infective dose, and virulence in 43 human pathogens from diverse taxonomic groups. They found that pathogens using locally acting molecules require a lower infective dose than those using distantly acting molecules. Contrary to the prediction, pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators were not more virulent. Instead, virulence was negatively correlated with infect dose and higher in pathogens infecting skin compared to ingested or inhaled. The study suggests that broad comparative analyses can explain variation in parasite traits such as infect dose and virulence, highlighting the importance of mechanistic details. Pathogens with distantly acting immune mod had significantly higher infect doses than locally acting molecules. However, no significant relationship was found between virulence and mechanism of pathogenesis. Case fatality was negatively related to infect dose, with pathogens infecting skin resulting in higher fatality than ingested or inhaled.
Researchers studied the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, which causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting 200 million people worldwide. They used a bioinformatics tool to analyze the 3' untranslated regions (3-UTR) of differentially expressed transcripts between juvenile and adult stages and found that the miR-277/498 family was significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult. A novel miRNA, sm-mi-498, was identified, located proximal to smi-277, suggesting a miRNA cluster. Hairpin structures were proposed for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. Expression of smi-277/498 was upregulated in adults, while their targets were downregulated in adults but not in immature females. smi-498 was expressed in tegument cells near the oesophagus and throughout the male body. The study suggests mi-277/498 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation during juvenile development and sexual maturation of females. A combined approach, including mi-target finder, was applied to schistosomes for the first time, providing evidence for the role of miRNAs in intra-malian development. The study identified a group of genes regulated by mi-277.
Researchers conducted a 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in a cave inhabited by horseshoe bats in Yunn Province, China, discovering 11 new strains with full-length genomes. Analysis of these strains, along with previous findings, revealed high diversity in the S, OR3, and OR8 genes. Notably, strains with high similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervar N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S1, OR3, and OR8 regions were found. Additionally, S-CoVs with similarity to human S-Co in OR3 and split OR8a,8 were discovered. Recombination analysis showed frequent events within S and around OR8 between S-Co. It is hypothesized that the direct S-Co progenitor may have originated from sequential recombination between S-Co precursors. Cell studies demonstrated three identified S-Co with different protein sequences can use human ACE as receptor, indicating close relationship to S-Co. This study provides insights into S-Co origin and highlights preparedness for future S-like diseases.
Researchers have examined the potential impact of density-dependent fecundity on the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT), a method used to detect drug resistance in human hookworms. Density-dependent fecundity refers to the phenomenon where female worms increase egg production in response to relaxation of density constraints, such as drug treatment. This can lead to underestimation of drug efficacy in FRT, as worms that survive treatment may increase egg output compared to pre-treatment levels. The degree of underestimation depends on worms' ability to increase egg output, which is constrained by their pre-treatment output. As worms in different hosts have varying densities, effects on efficacy may vary within groups. To improve measurements, cases with heaviest infections may be omitted from FRT, as they have greatest potential to increase output upon density relaxation. This highlights the need for new resistance methods, such as in vitro assays or genotypic changes, to monitor drug effects on isolated worms. In humans, anthelmint efficacy may not meet livestock criteria, suggesting suboptimal dosing, and constraints may be removed as density decreases. A study on canine hookworms showed increased output coincided with drug reduction, indicating density-dependent fecundity. Given its occurrence in human STH, this phenomenon likely applies. FRT may be distorted by density fecundity, making apparent drug changes difficult to identify amidst dynamic worm biology.
Researchers investigated the role of heparan sulfate (HS) in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SH) signaling during lung development. They found that deletion of HS synthase1 in epithelial cells resulted in expanded branching tips and reduced branching, associated with mesenchymal defects. FGF10 expression and FGF signaling were increased in mutant lungs, suggesting a non-autonomous mechanism. Reduced SH signaling was observed, responsible for suppressing F10 expression. Reactivating SH in mutant lungs rescued tip dilation and attenuated F signaling. Importantly, biologically active SH proteins were reduced in mutant epithelium and wild-type mesenchym cells. The study highlights HS as a key player in dictating SH signaling for lung morphogenesis. Decreased SH activity led to elevated F10 expression, contributing to dilated tips. Production of biologically active SH was reduced after HS loss in epithelium. HS is crucial in SH-producing epithelial cells for SH activity and lung morphogenesis. Epithelial HS deletion caused branching defects, including enlarged tips, decreased branching, and F10. SH signaling was reduced, essential for HS dictating SH-F10 cascade. Prior studies examined HS function in lung morphogenesis. HS synthase ablation in epithium resulted in reduced biologically SH particles on epith and mesyme, and reduced activity in receiving cells, causing F expression, leading to expanded tips and branching.
Paired-end sequencing is a technique used to detect genome rearrangements and structural variations on a genome-wide scale, particularly for copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and produce novel genes. Researchers investigated how much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement and localize them using theoretical models and simulations. A formula was derived for the probability of a fusion existing in a genome given paired sequences. This formula was used to compute fusion probabilities in breast cancer samples, finding accurate predictions with a small number of large fragments. The ability to detect fusions depends on gene length distribution and sequencing parameters impact breakpoint detection, localization, and gene detection, even with errors suggesting false rearrangements. These results are useful for calibrating future sequencing efforts, especially large-scale cancer studies enabled by next-generation technologies.

Paired-end sequencing detects rearrangement breakpoints, where non-adjacent coordinates in the reference are adjacent in the cancer genome. Breakpoints were extended to examine fusion detection. Next-generation technologies will provide reliable and precise fusion detection, enabling systematic analysis of genomic events leading to cancer. Maximizing fusion probability with least sequencing depends on factors including end-sequenced clones, fused gene length, and breakpoint errors. Theoretical and empirical formulae elucidate design trade-offs for current and next-generation technologies, making clones more reliable for multiple samples with limited paired reads. Paired sequencing errors include artifacts, assembly, sequence mis-mapping, leading incorrect fusions or false positives.
Researchers have proposed a mathematical model to explain the behavior of chemotaxis, a process by which cells sense and move towards chemical gradients. The model consists of three modules: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. The motility module is an excitable network that responds to uniform and gradient stimuli, while the gradient module is a local excitation-inhibition network that biases direction. The polarization module is linked to the motility network through the cytoskeleton, allowing cells to move persist and acquire front-back sensitivity. Simulations using a mechanical model of the cell cortex show that the modules recreate behaviors of chemotactic cells. The model demonstrates that adaptation is not required for chemaxis, as cells without it perform less efficiently. However, adaptation allows cells to adjust sensitivity when the midpoint of the gradient is raised. The model also shows that polarized and unpolar cells can coexist in a population and acquire polarity during migration. The LEG-B model simulates movement under various scenarios, illustrating the complexity of chemactic machinery. Experiments have shown that chemaxis pathways have redundancy at the biochemical level. The model proposes that chemaxis is an excitable network activity biased by chemoattract stimuli, with motility achieved through pseudodial protrusions.
Tudor domain-containing protein 6 (TD6) is a male-specific protein essential for chromatin body (Ch) structure and elongated spermatid development and fertility. In meiotic prophase I spermatocytes, TD6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, supporting splicing. TD6 also associates with spliceosomal protein Sm in the absence of RNA and arginine methylation-dependent manner. In TD-/-diplot spermatocytes, PR5 association with Sm and arginine methylation of Sm are reduced. TD deficiency impairs assembly of spliceosomes, featuring 3.5-fold increased U snRNPs in the nucleus. These deficiencies in splice maturation correlate with decreased numbers of SM-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in snRNA maturation. Transcript analysis of TD-deficient diplot spermatocytes reveals high numbers of splicing defects such as aberrant intron and exon usage as well as aberrant splice junctions. This study demonstrates a novel function of TD6 in splice maturation and mRNA splicing prophase I spermatocytes.
Researchers have developed a new Bayesian model to study the acquisition and clearance of bacterial colonization within a host, which improves upon previous methods that relied on a fixed genetic distance threshold to determine whether isolates are the same or different. The model provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, enabling the determination of bacterial clearance and acquisition from sampled genomes over time. It explicitly models within-host population variation using genetic simulation and uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for inference. The method was validated through simulations and applied to a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a longitudinal study. The model does not rely on a heuristic distance threshold, unlike previous approaches, and provides uncertainty estimates for relevant quantities. The study of colonization dynamics is based on inferring whether bacteria from collected over time represent the same or distinct events, allowing calculation of acquisition and clearance rates. Whole-genome sequencing provides a measure of genetic distance between isolates, used to infer their relationship. The model defines'strain' as a population of closely related isolates.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem initiates leaves and flowers, and lateral merist in highly ordered, spiralled or whorled patterns via phyllaxis. It is accepted that the transport of the hormone auxin plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that hormone transporters of the PIN family create auxin maxima at precise positions, which would lead to organ initiation. To explain how transporters could create flux to regions within the plant, concepts have been proposed. A hypothesis, canalization, proposes transport act by amplifying and stabilizing existing flux, which could be initiated, for example, by diffusion. This explains organized auxin flux during vein formation, but shoot apical meristem a hypothesis proposed, hormone would be transported to areas with highest concentrations. This implies coexistence of two different mechanisms for allocation in membrane, based on sensing and on concentration. Patterning processes require interaction of hundreds cells, impossible to estimate on intuitive if scenario plausible or not. Therefore, modelling provides means to test hypothesis. Using computer tool, show flux-based hypothesis explain auxin at meristem, providing unifying concept for control in plant. Experiments required to distinguish flux-based and other hypotheses.
Researchers have developed a new approach to refine wet lab experiments using in silico searches to identify diagnostic peptides for visceral leishmaniasis. They combined high-quality genome sequences and bioinformatic tools with lab experiments to create improved point-of-care tests for early detection and surveillance. Previous studies showed IgG as a biomarker for clinical status in rapid tests using crude antigen, but replacing it with specific antigens led to more robust tests. Immunoblots revealed L donovani proteins detected by IgG from patients. Mass spectrometry identified antigens and searched for constitutive expression and accessibility to B-cells. Epitopes were mapped in silico and screened in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes with VL and non-emic control sera, showing 90% sensitivity with Sudanese sera. Over 90 proteins from immunobl did not meet criteria and were excluded. Predicted epitopes from shortlisted identified the most reactive for IgG, 84% (95 CI 60-97) with VL sera. In sil searches reduced lab experiments, focusing on candidates with protein features, predicted epitopes were screened in arrays, identifying the most promising for IgG and specificity. This strategy can be applied to develop robust IgRDTs for monitoring status in VL.
A study of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries, including Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Iran, and others, found that 61.5% of cases had granulomas, with 25.2% being caseating, 4.6 suppurative, and 70.2 tuberculoid without necrosis. Caseating and tuboid granuloma groups differed significantly in geographical distribution, with more cases in Saudi Arabia (p<0.0001). Histologically, both groups differed in distribution of Ridley's pattern (p<0.000), with doubling 3 in caseating granulomas (31% vs 15%) and 5 in tuboid granuloma (38 vs 19%). Time to healing was shorter in tuboid vs case (4.0 vs 6.2 months). Parasitic index, species, and other variables did not differ between granuloma groups. An 18.2% of all cases had caseating granulomas, suggesting CL should be considered in differential diagnosis for caseating granulomas in endemic regions. Cases with caseating granulomas showed slower healing, no association with species, possibly due to worse immune response or aggressive leishmania strains.
Researchers have identified a gene, Zfp69, a zinc finger transcription factor, as a candidate for the diabetogenic effect of QTL Nidd/SJ, which is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in mice. The gene is located on distal chromosome 4 and was identified through interval-specific congenic introgression of SJ into diabetes-resistant C57/BL6 and subsequent cross with NZO mice. Analysis of genes in the critical interval by sequencing, qRT-PCR, and RACE-PCR revealed allelic variance of Zfp in NZ and C57/6, disrupted by a retrotranson IAP1 in intron 3, resulting in a truncated mRNA lacking KR and Znf2 domains, whereas diogenic SJ, NON, and B alleles generated normal mRNA. The diogenic ZfpSJ allele produced hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased liver triglyceride levels when combined with B6-Vob background. The human orthologue ZNF642 mRNA was increased in adipose tissue from type 2 diabetes patients. Zfp is likely the candidate for diogenic effect of NiddJ and retrotranson I1 contributes to genetic heterogeneity of strains. Expression in adipose tissue may play a role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Positional cloning of diabetes genes may provide insights into pathogenesis of obesity-associated diabetes. A QTL Nidd on dist chromosome 4 was previously identified in NZ and SJ outcross, exhibiting high LOD for blood glucose and doubling diabetes in NZxSJ backcross. Zfp was identified as likely candidate for diogenic effect of Nidd and aggravating obesity diabetes in NZ and hyperglycemia in B6ob mice.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive model to predict cell differentiation in the vertebrate hematopoietic system, a complex system with many branching pathways and cell types. The model integrates regulatory and signalling pathways controlling cell differentiation, using qualitative data and logical formalism for dynamical analysis. To handle the network's size and complexity, an original reduction approach and state identification algorithm were used. Simulations were performed in various environments to assess the effects of heterogeneity on cell differentiation, revealing stable states corresponding to Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes, as well as transient hybrid cells co-expressing combinations of Th, Th, Treg, and Th17 markers in environment-dependent fashion. The model highlights the nature of these types and their relationships with canonical subtypes, and can be used to explore novel pathways in silico.
Researchers used a thermodynamic model to investigate the mechanisms controlling genome-wide patterns of transcription factor binding during early Drosila development. They evaluated the contribution of different biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of embryonic-posterior patterning. Predictions based on sequence and protein-DNA affinities achieved a correlation of ∼0.4 with experimental measurements in vivo. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among factors and spatial patterning modeling had little effect on accuracy. A major source of error was prediction of events not occurring in vivo, attributed to reduced chromatin accessibility. Experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility improved predictions to ∼0.6-0.9 for various factors across target genes. The model was used to quantify roles of sequence, accessibility, and cooperativity. Results showed binding in open chromatin can be predicted by sequence specificity of individual factors with minimal interactions. A combination of experimentally determined chrom accessibility and computational models may predict binding of any transcription factor with precision.
In Drosophila imaginal discs, the basic helix-loop helix (bHL) transcription factors Daughterless (Da) and Extramacchaetea (Em) regulate cell cycle progression through transcriptional control of the Cdc25 phosphatase string. During epithelial cell development, the G2/M transition and proliferation are controlled by Em via Da. Ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced Em or high Da levels rescues proliferative defects in mutant cells. Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string. In Drosila, Em is required to downregulate Da, triggering mitosis via transcriptional activation of the conserved cell cycle component C25. Em and Da are essential proliferative factors for various cell types, expressed in addition to nervous precursors. The interaction between these proteins and other bHL factors determines cell fate in developmental contexts. In Drosila, Da and Em are the sole representatives of classes I and VHL, facilitating functional studies.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive pipeline to analyze phosphoprote data from interventional experiments to identify key proteins and signaling networks involved in cell growth and development. Phosphoproteomics is a tool to determine relative phosphorylation levels on a large scale, but differs from proteomics due to limited detectable sites per protein. The pipeline includes phosphopeptide analysis, correlation, network analysis, and causal discovery, and compensates for missing data issue in proteomics. The dataset was generated using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling Amino acids in Cell) with kinase-dead mutants. The pipeline was applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentous growth, identifying 5 high-confidence proteins and 19 hub proteins, all involved in stress responses. Nine have direct or indirect involvement in filament growth. Four predicted proteins were validated by phenotypic experiments, showing differential growth. The pipeline presents a systematic way to discover signaling networks using phosphrote data and suggests candidates for investigation. The methodology is applicable to other interventional studies via different platforms.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster male germl to determine if it undergoes dosage compensation or meiotic inactivation. They found that X-wide dosage compensation is absent in most of the Doph male germl, contradicting previous reports. Microarray analysis showed no evidence for X-specific inactivation during meiosis. The expression of transgenes driven by autosomal spermatogenesis promoters was reduced when inserted on the X versus autosomes, but this difference was established premeiotic and persisted in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression could not be explained by dosage compensation, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism limits expression from X during sperogenesis in Doph. These findings resolve conflicting reports and have implications for genome evolution and speciation in Doph.
Citrobacterium infection in mice is a model for human diarrheal disease caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The pathogenesis of both species depends on forming epithelium-adherent microcolonies, known as "attachment/effacement" (A) lesions. These microcolonies must be dynamic and self-renew by refection of rapidly regenerating epithelium. Research shows that colonic epithelial A microies are clonal populations and depend on clonal growth to persist. In wild mice, microies are established within 18 hours of infection, shaping intestinal infection geography and severity. Mechanistically, resistance to A lesion formation is mediated by TLR-My88/Tr-dependent signaling and induced by virulent C. rodium in a virulence-dependent manner. Establishment of C. rodium pathogenesis is restricted to a short window determining disease severity. 

The development of colonic C. rodium pathogenesis is dependent on early-host interactions. A lesions determine severity from single-bacterial epithelial events within 18 hours. The study focused on early A development shows initiation is limited to a stage. Established clally-renew A lesions trigger innate response protecting epith from de novo formation by luminal bacteria, determining disease outcome. Colonic A lesions depend on cell-to-cell spread, not continuous seeding from plankic luminal colonizers compensating epith shedding. Data reveal epith-adherent C. rodium from a small population (bacterium per micro) subject bottleneck.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, such as species or genes, when only a fraction of each population is sampled due to data collection or sequencing limitations. Current methods for estimating overlap from incomplete samples are biased and uncertain. The new method, based on Bayesian inference, accounts for sampling rates and provides unbiased Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap and quantifies uncertainty. This approach is relevant in ecology and epidemiology, particularly for malaria, where the number of species or genes in each population is known. The method can be used to study the trade-off between sampling effort and uncertainty. It differs from existing non-probabilistic indices and metrics, which assume complete species counts, leading to bias. The approach can be extended to other cases by changing assumptions or sampling statistics. The method was tested on a scenario of two Plasmodium falciparum parasites with 60 types each, estimating the true overlap from samples sharing types. The goal is to quantify uncertainty in estimates when sampling is stochastic. The method underestimates overlap when samples are small, but can be improved with whole-genome data as prior. This opens analysis of Plasmod spp multigene families and β-divers in multig families with fixed or sampled sizes.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms regulating the active state of eukaryotic kinases, enzymes that phosphorylate proteins through a conserved catalytic core. Using cAMP protein kinase as a model, they employed biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to identify conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that harmoniously regulate the active mechanics. A salt bridge between lysine from the β-strand and glutamate from α-helix, and electrostatic interaction between phosphorylated loop and α-helix and hydrophobic residues of Regulatory Shell were found to be crucial. Contrary to previous thought, the conserved lysine in β-str was not required for phosphorylation but essential for active state. 

The α-phosphates interact with lysine in β-str, forming a salt with glutamate αelix. Initially, it was assumed lys was for ATP binding and glutamate for stabilizing lys. In absence of salt and electro interaction, active mechanics can be regulated through Shell. Enhancing hydrophity of from leucine to phenylane connected β-region and α-h through hydro interaction between Sh2 and Sh from β-region and RS αelix. Replacing lys with glutamine rescued catalytic activity by repositioning lys onto loop. Hypothesized inefficient catalysis due to hydroph clamp, lobe twisting, and misaligned ATP. Breaking salt by mutating glutamate to alanine destabilized active associated with Shell, unable to undergo autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation, or catalysis. However, Shell assembly was partially restored by coexpressing with, introducing interaction between phosphorylated loop and αelix. Despite not required for phosphorylation, lys is structural sensor facilitating state by coordinating β-region with αelix.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) from 2000-2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF). The World Health Organization recommends post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of LF. This study compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-M surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 and a community-based survey of people ≥8. In 2016, a systematic school-based TAS was conducted in 29 elementary schools and a cluster survey in 28 villages on two islands, collecting data on demographics, risk factors, and blood samples for circulating filarial antigen (CA) using Alere Filariasis Strip. The school TAS (n=114) identified 9 antigen-positive children with an adjusted CA prevalence of 0.7% (95%CI: 0.3-1.8), while the community survey (n=7,711) identified 102 antigen people with an adjusted CA of 6.2% (95%:4.5-8.6). C prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school TAS had limited sensitivity (0-23.8%) and negative predictive value (25-83.3%) but high specificity (83.3-100%) and positive value (0-100%) for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community survey identified antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both confirmed recrudence of LF transmission.
In zebraf, sex determination is a complex and polygenic, influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors, with germ cells, particularly oocytes, playing a crucial role in female development. Recent studies have shown that oocytes are required throughout adult life to maintain the female phenotype, but the mechanism is unknown. This study investigates the role of two oocyte-produced signaling molecules, Gdf9 and Bmp, in female sex determination and maintenance in zraf. Mutations in Bmp result in females developing normally but switching to males during mid-to-late juvenile stage and becoming fertile. Aromatase c19a1 mutations show estrogen production is necessary for female development, and Bmp's function in sex maintenance is linked to regulating estrogen biosynthesis via promoting estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle. Bmp mutant females initially develop normally, but oocytes degenerate at early stages and premeiotic cells switch to sperogenic, transforming the gonad to a testis. The study provides insights into oocyte regulation of sex maintenance in zraf. The hypothesis is that o-somatic gon interaction stabilizes c19a1 expression and estrogen production by the somatic gon. Consistent with this, the somatic gon expresses probable Bmp receptors. Cypa1 functions as a switch determining female vs male in zraf and medaka, animals lacking oocytes develop as males, regardless of genotype, and oocytes are required in adult zraf life to maintain sex. This study identifies genes c19a1 and Bmp required for female development and maintenance, establishing a pathway for sexual development and maintenance inraf conserved in fish.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in controlling morphogenesis along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals by regulating target genes within their broad expression domains. To achieve high regulatory specificity, it is proposed that H proteins co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their targets in a context-dependent manner. However, few of these factors have been identified. This study analyzes the regulation of the death gene reaper (pr) by the H protein Deformed (D) and suggests that activation of pr expression in the anterior maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of D with eight functionally diverse transcription regulators on a minimal enhancer. Context-dependent combinations of H proteins and other factors on small H response elements (HRE) could be responsible for spatio-temporal expression of H targets. Eight transcription regulators, Apt, G, Gcm, E, En, Sl1, Br, Doc, and Disco, are required in addition to H protein D to regulate pr expression in a subset of maxillary cells. D is active throughout the maxillary, whereas pr is found locally, suggesting additional factors contribute to D-dependent pr expression. Proper spatio H target regulation is achieved by combined action of multiple regulators: H proteins and structurally diverse factors. Studies on Ex and H revealed H regulation includes complex formation between H and co-regulatory factors. The ability of a broadly H protein to regulate a gene in spatial and temporal context is achieved H-independent recruitment of context-specific factors to cis-sequences in H.
Researchers investigated the genetic requirements for signaling from an autoactive Arabidopsis thaliana NB-LRR protein, ADR-L2, which functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in defense responses. ADR-L2 acts as a "helper" to transduce specific activation from sensor NB-LRs and its activity does not require an intact P-loop. ADR-L and two related members are required for unregulated cell death in lsd mutant. An autoactive mutation A1-LD484 was generated in a homology motif M, leading to dwarf plants with increased resistance and high SA levels. The phenotype requires intact P, suggesting A-L484 phenotypes reflect canonical NB activation. A-L484 was used to define signaling requirements. Signaling from A-L484 does not require NAD oxidase and is regulated by E1 and At1. Transcription of A484 is correlated with phenotyp outputs, both SA-dependent and-independent. Requirements for A484 resemble SA-dependent signal amplification and death observed in LSD. Importantly, A484 autoactivation is controlled by E and SA separable but linked pathways. A model provides insight into SA feedback loop including A2.
Researchers investigated the components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis and their interaction with the MOR6 protein, which mediates transcriptional silencing. They found that SUVH and SUV9, previously thought to be components of the RDM pathway, interact with MOR6 and contribute to transcriptional silencing. SUV2 and SUV9 can act in the same pathway as MOR6 or synergistically with MOR6 to mediate transcription silencing. ID2, another RDM component, interacts with MOR6 and mediates silencing of a subset of MOR6 target loci. Other RDM components, including Pol IV, V, R2, and DRM2, are also required for transcription silencing at subset MOR6 loci. MOR6 was previously shown to mediate silencing through heterochrom condensation. The SWI/SNF chrom-remodeling complex components SW3, SW3, and SWD interact with MOR6 and SUV9 and mediate silencing. These results suggest RDM components are involved not only in methylation but also in MOR6-mediated heterrom condensation. This study links methylation to heterrom condensation and enhances silencing at methyl genomic regions. The interaction between SUV9 and MOR6 suggests SUV9 binding to methylated DNA is required for MOR6 recruitment to chromatin. MOR6 interacts with ID2 and SW/S complex to mediate heterrom cond. Components work together to link methylation and heterrom cond, enhancing silencing at methyl regions. MOR6 functions in silencing loci targeted by RDM components. Whole-genome methylation and RNA-seq data show release of silencing in mor6 not associated with loss methylation.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp) in modulating phenotypes in vertebrates, using zebraf as a model. Hsp is a molecular chaperone that buffers genetic variation, potentially accounting for the variable penetrance and severity of heritable developmental malformations. Inhibition of Hsp did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains, but increased the severity of recessive eye phenotypes caused by paxb and su mutations. A previously unobserved spectrum of severe eye malations, including anophthalmia, microphthalm, and nanthalmia, was uncovered by limited Hsp inhibition. Breeding offspring from unaffected parents led to elevated malformation frequencies, revealing oligogenic nature. Unlike Drosila, Hsp inhibition decreased developmental stability in zraf, indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophia, microphthalm, and nanthalm phenotypes. Analysis of paxb mutation suggests a mechanism for buffering by Hsp. Zraf studies imply that mild perturbation of H at critical stages may underpin variable penetrance and expressivity of developmental anomalies where genotype and environment interact.
Researchers have identified and characterized N-terminal acetylation in Drosoph melanogaster, a common protein modification found throughout the tree of life where the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide becomes co-translationally acety after the removal of the initiating methion residue. Analyzing amino-terminal peptides from Drosila K167 cells, they detected over 1,200 mature Ntermini and found N acylation occurs with similar frequency in insects as humans. A sole determinant of N acylation is the X rule, which indicates acylation under all circumstances. This rule was used to genetically engineer proteins to study biological relevance of presence or absence of acetyl group, creating a generic assay to probe importance of N acylation. The assay was applied by expressing mutated transgenes in cell lines and flies. A straightforward strategy to study relevance of N acylation in cells and organisms is presented. The X rule seems conserved in lower and higher eukaryotes, proposing its use to study acylation in all species.
Researchers investigated the termination mechanism of RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) in Saccharomyces pombe, a crucial for tRNA production during cell proliferation and cancer. They used a tRNA suppression system to identify mutants with gain and loss of termination phenotypes, mapping 122 mutations to a 3.9 Å structure of the RN III elongation complex. Mutations cluster in the active center helix, loop, and pore, and funnel, indicating involvement of the cleavage domain of subunit C in termination. Purified RN III from a readthrough mutant exhibited increased elongation rate, supporting a kinetic model where elongation inversely relates to termination efficiency. Mutants showed correlations in vitro and in vivo, surprisingly synthesizing more RNA than wild-type cells, not accounted for by increased elongation. Activity was unrelated to the III repressor M1. Results show center elements of RN III, including C, are termination determinants, activating overall transcription. Mutations in cancer suggest an unforeseen mechanism of III activation in disease.
Researchers have developed a method to predict protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains using the structure of SH-phosphope complexes and the FoldX algorithm. This approach was shown to perform similarly to experimentally derived consensus and substitution matrices in predicting in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. The method was used to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH domains with known structure and phosphorylation state. Predictions were validated using literature-derived SH interactions and a probabilistic score from naive Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation, interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions. The predictions led to a new hypothesis for SH domains in signaling.

The method's portability to other SH domains remains to be shown, but FoldX was shown to predict in vitro thermodynamics of protein-phosphope complexes for nine SH domains, indicating applicability for genome-wide predictions. Structure-based prediction of SH-mediated protein-protein interactions has been addressed once. Future methods should account for biophysics and biology of SH domains. FoldX predicted in vivo interactions for nine SH-containing proteins and annotated with supporting information, providing a resource for experimental testing. Fold performed as well as consensus or substitution matrices in prediction in vitro and in vivo interactions. With phosphorylation and structure, Fold gave accurate predictions novel-protein interactions.
Researchers have identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (Cy40) that can dissolve toxic amyloid proteins, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These proteins, like tau, are intrinsically disordered and enriched with proline residues that regulate their structure and aggregation. Cy40, a cis peptid-proly isomerase (Pase), interacts with tau at proline-rich sites and dissolves amyloids in vitro. In a mouse model of tau accumulation, overexpressing Cy40 reduced oligomers and tangles, preserving neuronal health and cognition. Nuclear magnetic resonance revealed Cy40 interacts with tau at proline-rich sites. Additionally, Cy40 disaggregated other aggregating proteins with prolines, but lacking Pase activity prevented disaggregation. A unique property of Cy40 allows it to disaggregate energy-independently. This study introduces a novel protein disagase and demonstrates its capacity to dissolve intracellular amyloids. Overexpressing Cy40 in tauopathic brains suggests strategies to halt or rescue cognitive deficits associated with neurotoxicloids.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the formation and maintenance of heteroc patterns in cyanobacteria filaments, a type of cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms. The model combines the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacter with the diffusion of nitrogen along the filament, capturing the development and sustainment of heteroc patterns. This approach bridges the gap between macroscopic and microscopic processes of heteroc formation under nitrogen deprivation. The model simulates the behavior of a single cyanacter under different conditions and the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments by coupling their genetic circuits via diffusion. Results show that including diffusion and noise in the model reproduces the main features of heteroc formation and sustainment in cyanobacteria as observed experimentally. The model connects the regulatory network of cyanobacteria with the machinery of systems biology, capturing the development and maintenance of heteroc patterns. It reveals that noise plays a crucial role in the onset of differentiation, enabling characteristic heteroc patterns for various parameters. The model consists of a filament of cyanobacteria, each with a dynamical circuit, interacting through protein diffusion.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to investigate the association between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermect (CTI) program and oncherciasis, and their adherence to iverectin in three regions with high onchias prevalence. A cross-sectional survey was carried out in three districts, with 30 participants randomly selected per district. Adherence toiverect was comparable in Bang and Bafia (55.0% and 48.8%, respectively) and lower in Yab (40.7%). Perceptions of the program and disease were studied, and perceptions of the program were most determinant of adherence toiver. People with a "positive" opinion ofiverect distribution were more compliant than those with a negative opinion (40% vs 55 in Bang, 48 vs 62 in Bafia). Misconceptions about onchias transmission included lack of hygiene in Bafia and Yab, and high sugar consumption in Bang. Perceptions ofiverect distribution were strongly associated with adherence.
This study investigated the contribution of genetic and epigenetic variations to protein biomarkers for cancer and cardiovascular disease by combining DNA methylation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data with protein measurements. A total of 121 biomarkers were analyzed in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 positions and over 10 million SNPs. Epigenome-wide association study (EW) and genome-wide association study (GW) analyses were performed on 698 and 103 samples, respectively. The study identified 124 and 45 loci associated with biomarkers, with effect sizes up to 0.22 units per 1% change in DNA methylation and 4 units per copy of the allele. Most GW loci were cis-regulatory, while EW loci were in trans. Eleven EW loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including NL5 with CX11, CX9, IL12, and IL18. EW signals overlapping with GW loci were driven by genetic variants, while EW signals were confounded by smoking. Cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers had effect on DNA methylation, but not vice versa. Associations between biomarkers and methylation at numerous loci in the genome likely reflect genetic, environmental, or secondary effects of disease pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated how varicella zoster virus (VZV) affects natural killer (NK) cells, a type of immune cell that fights viral infections. They found that VV directly impairs NK cells' ability to respond to stimulation, leading to reduced cytotoxic and cytokine responses. Not only VV-infected NK cells were affected, but also NK cells exposed to VV in culture were inhibited. This impairment was dependent on direct contact between NK cells and V-infected cells. Profiling NK surface receptors showed expression was stable, but cells were still capable of releasing cytotoxic granules when signaling was bypassed. Key components of degranulation signaling were also perturbed. IFN-γ and TNF production were repressed in V-culture, especially in V-infected NK cells. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also infected NK cells and made them unresponsive to stimulation, but differently regulated cytokine production compared to VV. The study reveals a new strategy for VV to evade the immune system by inhibiting NK function.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanisms underlying apparent motion (AM), a phenomenon where two stimuli presented at different locations evoke a perception of a stimulus moving between them. They found that AM has a distinct effect on detection of gratings, limiting performance at high contrast levels, strongest when target orientation matches inducers. A population model of early visual processing, based on contrast normalization, predicts AM-related activation in visual cortex is too small to cause masking or perceived motion. Instead, suppression of early responses during AM is consistent with predictive coding, where higher-level motion predictions "explain" lower-level sensory input. AM induces responses in V1 cells tuned to locations and properties of inducers, interfering with actual stimuli perception. However, masking doesn't necessarily imply V1 activation. Predictive models suggest responses along AM path are suppressed when predictable, matching features and timing of moving stimulus. The study examined AM's influence on low-level processing by investigating detection of gratings along path, finding impairment when target matches inducers' orientation. A previous study reported masking at single stimulus level, maximum performance reduction not linked to uncertainty. A population model of V1 captures results, but can't rule out effects in other early cortex areas.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax plays a crucial role in the transformation of CD4+ T cells by promoting cell proliferation and survival, primarily through the activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of NF-κ target genes. To understand the underlying mechanism, it is essential for understanding HTLV-mediated transformation. Studies have suggested multiple mechanisms for Tax-induced IK activation, mainly due to blending of primary Tax-induced IK events and secondary IK events induced by cytokines secreted by Tax-induced IK-NF-κ activation. In a cell-free system, Tax-stimulated IK activation was reconstituted to dissect essential components for IK activation by Tax. Tax was found to be a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, with Ubc2, Ubc5, or U7, catalyzing assembly of mixed-link polyubiquitin chains. These mixed-link polyubiquitin chains are responsible for IK activation by binding to the NEM subunit of IK. The biochemical function of Tax in IK activation was revealed, utilizing minimal ubiquitination components for NF-κ activation.
Researchers conducted a systematic review of the relationship between the number of individuals introduced individuals (propagule pressure) and the success of alien species establishment. They used Bayesian meta-analytical methods to evaluate this relationship across various taxa, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. A positive effect of propagule pressure on establishment was found in all tested hypotheses, but success was most dependent on a range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect was primarily associated with analytical approaches, with larger effect sizes in animal introductions compared to plant introductions. No variation was accounted for by study scale (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy). The study reveals consistency in the relationship between propagule pressure and alien establishment.
Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a cytokine implicated in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases, enhances the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the decay of encoding mRNAs. The decay of these mRNAs depends on proteins (AUBs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region of mRN and facilitate either decay or stabilization. A novel ribonucleoprotein complex assembles in the presence of microRNA (miR16), leading to degradation of target mRN. IL-17 attenuates miR expression and promotes binding of stabilizing Aps over destabilizing Aps, reducing decay. mi16 independently directs competition between degrading and stabilizing Aps for mRN. Aps affect about 8% of the human transcriptome and mi16 is ubiquitously expressed, IL-17 may affect other processes besides inflammation.

IL-17 modulates interactions between Aps, mi16, and target mRN largely on specific sequences and structural restraints. Besides IL-17, IL-1 attenuates mRNA degradation. Epithelial and fibroblast IL-17 with TN- attenuates degradation mRN encoding inflammatory mediators, resulting in hyper production pro-inflammatory mediators. We report degradation mRN encoding IL-8, IL-6, and G-CS by AMD pathway, depending concerted Aps and mi16. Findings show modulation Ap-mi16 regulation by IL-17 on specific target, mi16 usage and Aps participation.

IL-8 degradation inhibited AUF absence mi16, IL-17 attenuated mi16 binding complex, and promoted IL-8 AUF, stabilizing IL8. Similar other ARE-mRN, variousps compete binding target, balance regulated IL- likely mi16. IL-17 inhibition mi16 and mi using LNA resulted attenuated decay. Stable mi expression lentiviral constructs mi16 (Utrecht, Netherlands) enhanced degradation.
A study was conducted in Uganda to examine the relationship between Trypanosoma brucei infection in humans and cattle in villages with and without reported cases of sleeping sickness. The study found that villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness had a higher odds of Trypanosoma brucei infection in cattle compared to villages without cases (OR: 2.94, 95%CI: 1.38-6.24). Cattle age was also a significant factor, with cattle between 18-36 months and over 36 months old having higher odds of Trypanosoma bruce infection than under 18 months old (OR:3.51, 95CI:1.63-7.51 and OR:4.20,95:2.08-8.67 respectively). Village sleeping sickness status had a significant effect on the detection of Trypanosoma rhodes in cattle, with higher likelihood in case villages (OR:25,95:1.2-520.71). A higher average Trypanoma bruce prevalence in a herd was associated with higher likelihood of Trypan rhodes detection (OR:25,95:1.2-520.71). The study suggests a strong association between high Tryoma bruce levels in a village and likelihood of detecting Try rhodes and village sleeping sickness status. This could be used to determine risk at village or parish level in endemic districts in Uganda.
Researchers have investigated the role of the NS complex in regulating housekeeping genes in Drosophila. The complex is composed of proteins NS1, NS3, MBD2, MCR2, and MOF, and is involved in the regulation of chromosomal and autosomal genes. While the function of the MSL complex as a dosage regulator is well understood, the role of the NS complex is poorly characterized. A comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of the four NS complex members throughout the Doph melanogaster genome revealed that 85.5% of NS-bound genes are constitutively expressed across cell types. NS-targeted genes have increased histone modifications H4ac, H3me, Hme, and Hac in promoter regions, and well-defined nucleosome-free regions and broad transcription initiation patterns. ChIP-seq of RNA polymerase II in NS1 and NS3-depleted cells showed that both proteins are required for efficient recruitment of II to NS-target promoters. The II reduction coincides with compromised binding of TBP and TFI to promoters, indicating the NS complex is required for optimal recruitment of the initiation complex on genes. Genes with most loss of II upon NS knockdown are enriched in Replication Element. The findings show the MO-containing NS complex regulates housekeeping genes by modulating II transcription initiation.
Researchers have developed a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FD), a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4 macrosatellite repeat and ectopic expression of DUX, a gene encoding a germline transcription factor. The model recapitulates epigen and D4 expression seen in patients and controls, including high D4 expression in germline, incomplete epigen repression in somatic tissue, and FD-specific variegated D4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4 chromatin relaxation. The study suggests somatic epigen silencing of D4 is conserved and contracted D4 arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to varieg expression of D4 protein in skeletal nuclei. Ch and DNA methylation analyses indicate chrom relaxation of D4 repeats in D4-2.5 mice compared to D-12.5 mice, concord with observed D4 expression, modeling difference between FD patients and individuals. In muscle, D4 activates gerine and stem programs while suppressing innate response genes. The model may serve therapeutic studies targeting D4 expression in muscle, as detrimental effects can be reversed by RNA interference. Somatic derepression D4 has been associated with changes D4 chrom structure, characterized decreased methylation and lower CS. The D- pattern suggests locus-intrinsic property of D repeat, conserved between mouse and human.
Researchers developed a malaria vaccine candidate, Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1), to induce protection against Plasmodium falciparum, but it only works against strains closely related to the vaccine. To overcome this limitation, they studied the structural basis of cross-strain invasion and developed a vaccine containing four diverse AMA1 allelic proteins, Quax or Q, which elicited polyclonal antibodies that inhibited invasion of four vaccine and non-vaccine strains. Comparing polyclonal anti-Q with strain-specific monoval, 3D AMA revealed Q induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with conserved domain-3 and reduced domain-2 responses. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies against Q reacted with a cross-reactive epitope at the rim of hydrophobic domain-1, mapped to conserved AMA1 and encompassing the 1-loop. Monoclonal antibodies to the 1-loop (1,4,8,11) were 10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA-inhib m and mode of action was inhibition of AMA binding to ligand R2. Unlike epitope of previously 3D-specific mAb,1, the 1-loop inhibitory epitope was conserved across strains. Novel mAb10 bound domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked proteolytic processing of AMA. mAb10 was weakly inhibitory but synergized with previously strain-transending m,4, which binds to hydroobic on conserved and inhibits R2 binding AMA. Novel susceptible regions and epitopes identified can improve antigen breadth and inhib response of AMA vaccines. Vaccination with diverse proteins may provide universal coverage by redirecting response to conserved epitopes.
Researchers have discovered a previously unknown mechanism that regulates the timing of mitotic spindle displacement in cells, which is crucial for unequal cell division. The mechanism involves the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). In Caenorhabditis elegans zygotes, mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. Reducing the function of the proteasome, APC, or C20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating CD in metaphase caused the spindle to displace early. Experimentally unlinking spindle from this mechanism resulted in premature displacement of incompletely assembled components of the mitotic spindle. The study found that the timing of spindle displacement is precisely regulated in C. elegans and that the proteome and APC time spindle through their roles inactivating CD. Displacement is not required for anase timing in C. elegans, instead CD activity affects spindle and anase independently. Regulation of CD by proteome F-1 and APC serves as a timer for mitotic displacement, resulting in a 60-90 delay that allows spindle assembly to complete before being pulled away from the cell center.
Researchers conducted a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetan and Andean populations. High-altitude populations exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations, but the underlying genetic basis is unknown. The study looked at each chromosome for genomic regions with unknown function regarding altitude phenotypes and examined genes in oxygen metabolism and sensing. Four population statistics were used to detect signatures of natural selection, identifying candidate genes and regions in each population separately. Tibetan and Andean adaptation patterns are distinct, with evidence of selection in different genes or regions. One gene, EGLN (PH2), known for oxygen sensing, shows selection in both populations, but variation differs between them. Key H-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation in Andeans and Tibetans, and chromosomal regions implicated in putative response. Data suggest genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and basis for genotype-phenotype studies to confirm selection-nominated genes and regions.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA can result from environmental interactions or cellular processes and are a major source of genetic instability. Efficient repair of DSBs is crucial for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. The choice of repair pathway is important to maintain genomic integrity. Inverted repeats (IRs) near DSBs can channel repair from accurate gene conversion to break-induced replication (BIR) pathway, leading to instability. IRs form unusual structures in single-strand DNA formed by DSB resection. They can form two types of structures: intermolecular single-strand annealing (SSA) leading to inverted dimers and intramolecular SSA to fold-back (FB) structures. Both interfere with accurate repair and channel DSB into BIR, promoting destabilization. Protein complexes process FB with short (12-b) versus long (1-k) loops: MR-Sae2 and Rad1-Rad10, respectively. Studies uncover mechanisms of destabilization from DSB repair by IR. Given IR abundance in the genome, findings contribute to understanding IR-mediated destabilization associated with human disease.
Researchers developed a Drosophila melanogaster model to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo. Pseudas aerugin is an opportunistic pathogen causing acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, with chronic infections thought to be caused by biofilms. Biofilms are structured, multicellular microbial communities encased in an extracellular matrix enabling long-term survival in the host. The model allowed in vivo study of P aerugin biofilms in Dophila. At 24 hours post-infection, P aerugin biofilms localized and were visualized in Dila crops, with characteristic structure and extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysacide. aerugin cells from vivo biofilms had increased antibiotic resistance relative to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on expression of exopolysacide genes, as pel:: mutant failed to form biofilms. The:: mutant was more virulent than PA1, while hyperbio strain (Z3) demonstrated less virulence than PA1, indicated by survival of infected at 14 postinfection. Bio formation by PA1 and Z3 in crop was associated with induction of dipteric, cecin A and antimicrobial gene expression 24 postin. Infection with non-bio forming resulted in decreased gene expression.
Researchers investigated the contribution of the proximal 5' flanking sequence and microsatellite variation on vasopressin 1 receptor (Av1) gene expression and behavior. The Av1 gene exhibits diverse expression patterns within and between species, influencing vasopress-mediated behaviors. The study used homologous recombination in mice to reveal that the proximal 5' flanking sequence modestly contributes to species-specific vasopress receptor 1 (V1R) distribution and confirmed that V1R variation impacts stress-coping in the forced swim test. The Av1 microsatellite structure was found to contribute to Av1 expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring inter and intra-species differences in V1R patterns in voles. This is the first evidence that polymorphic microsat elements near behaviorally relevant genes contribute to diversity in brain expression, providing a mechanism for generating diversity at individual and species levels. However, results suggest that species-specific patterns are mediated by elements outside the 5' flanking region of the gene.
Researchers have developed a yeast system to study the mechanisms of genome instability caused by impaired ribonucleoprotein (RNP) biogenesis and Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in mammalian cells. They found that ID induces double-strand breaks (DSBs) in immunoglobulin switch regions and c-MYC sequences in yeast mutants impaired in R biogenesis, leading to chromosomal translocations via Non-homous End Joining (NHE). ID-induced translocations were enhanced in R biogenesis mutants, suggesting that ID-mediated DS depend on loop formation. The study provides new insights into the role of bi in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of ID-mediated instability, and shows that uracil residues produced by ID deamination are processed into DS and chromosomal rearrangements by conserved DNA repair functions in yeast and mammalian cells. The yeast system offers a validated assay to study mechanisms leading to DS at regions and c-M oncogene, such as those occurring in cells responsible for switching or translocations associated with Burkitt lymphomas.
Researchers investigated how Escheria coli cells partition their chromosomes during asymmetric cell division when the cell division plane is not properly positioned. Using time-lapse imaging, they found that the protein Fts can pump up to 80% of the 3.7 Mb chromosome between daughters at an average rate of 1700-800 bp/s, with rare pauses and no reversals. The majority of DNA movement occurs at late stages when the division protein ZipA has dissociated from the septum and the septum is closed to a narrow channel smaller than 250 nm. This suggests the constriction is necessary for effective DNA translocation by Fts. The study demonstrates E. coli can reposition their chromosomes when division is not localized, contradicting the common view that accurate positioning is essential for viability.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework for selecting the optimal set of peptides for epitope-based vaccines using integer linear programming. Epitope-based vaccines have various applications, including therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for infectious diseases and cancer. The development of an epitope-based vaccine relies on knowledge of target-specific antigens from immunogenic peptides, called epitopes, which form key components of the vaccine. Due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns, the number of epitopes in a vaccine is limited, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding epitopes are highly polymorphic, every patient has a set of MHC I and II molecules differing specificities. A combination effective for one person can be ineffective for another, making optimal epitope selection important. The framework selects the set of epitopes with the maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response from a user-defined or experimentally determined epitopes. The integer programming approach allows formulation of various vaccine design problems and efficient identification of optimal epitopes. Immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes per antigen, coverage of MHC alleles, and avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates, can be translated into constraints or modifications of the objective within the framework. The implementation outperforms a greedy strategy and evolutionary algorithm with runtimes of seconds for typical problem sizes. The framework is flexible to account for variants of the problem, including personalized vaccines, and is the first to find provably optimal epitopes.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in facilitating HIV-1 transmission to the cervico-vaginal tissue in an ex vivo system. IL-7 is a cytokine present in high concentrations in the semen of HIV-1-infected individuals, and its effects on HIV-1 replication in isolated cells and infected individuals have been reported. The study simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue with IL-7 concentrations comparable to those in HIV-1-infected semen. Results showed IL-7 significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in cervicoaginal tissue and lymphoid explants. Analysis of infected cells revealed IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell apoptosis and increased expression of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma (Bcl-2). IL-7 also increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ cells. High IL-7 levels in semen may contribute to the survival of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervicoaginal mucosa, promoting local infection expansion and dissemination. The study demonstrates IL-7 facilitates HIV-1 male-to-female transmission, suggesting high IL-7 in semen may make the female genital mucosa more susceptible to HIV-1 acquisition.
Researchers studied the interaction between the Zika virus (ZIK) and the RNA interference (RNA) response in Aedes aegypt cells, the primary mosquito vector for ZIK transmission. They found that ZIK induces the production of virus-specific small interfering (si) RNAs and PI-interacting (pi) RNAs, although the piRNAs lack the characteristic signature of typical small RNAs. The siRNAs were loaded into the Ago2 protein, but silencing this protein did not enhance virus replication, and increased replication was observed in Ago2 knockout cells, indicating an antiviral role of the exo-si pathway. ZIK-specific piRNAs were detected, but lacked the piRNA ping-pong motif and were bound to Ago3, not Piwi or Pi6. Silencing Pi proteins showed that knockdown of Ago, Pi5, or Pi6 did not enhance ZIK replication, but Pi4 displayed antiv activity. The study also found that ZIK capsid protein amplified replication of a reporter virus, unlike yellow fever protein, which inhibits the exoRNA pathway.
A study was conducted in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to investigate the association between Sporothrix species and clinical manifestations of sporrichosis. Fifty patients with different clinical manifestations were analyzed, and their isolates were studied using phenotypic and genotypic methods. The results showed distinct clinical and therapeutic responses between Sporoth brasili (n=45) and Sporoth schenii sensu stricto (n=5). Sporoth brasili was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection, mucosal infection, and hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Sporoth schii presented less severe and localized disease, similar to previously described sporrich cases. Sporothili-infected patients required shorter itraconazole treatment (16 weeks) compared to Spor schii (24 weeks). This suggests Sporoth species are linked to different manifestations of sporrich and Sporili is effectively treated with itraazole. This is the first study to demonstrate genotypic identification of Sporoth species and clinical aspects of sporrich. The findings add to knowledge on Sporili disease and support careful speciation of Spor isolates for clinical care. Sporili has been reported in Brazilian states other than Rio Janeiro, but frequency is lower than Spor schii. Sporili caused typical forms of sporrich (lymphocutaneous and cutaneous) but disseminated in one case. Spor presentations of sporrich by Spor spp are variable and poorly understood.
Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed beyond annotated genes, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts remain unclear. This study used single-end and paired RNA-Seq and tiling to assess the quantity and composition of Poly+ RNA in human and mouse tissues. Relative to tiling, RNASeq identified many transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs, with most being introns, suggesting they are pre-mRNA fragments. Chromosomal locations of intergenic regions in RNASeq are near genes, consistent with alternative splicing, polyadenylation, and promoter-terminator transcripts or new exons. Reads bridging splice sites identified 5,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Remaining seqags correspond to single reads displaying random sampling or low background or small transcripts (median 111bp) at higher levels, displaying conservation and originating from open chromatin. Bonaide intergenic transcripts exist, but their number is low compared to exons, and genome not pervasively transcribed as reported. 

The majority of intergenic and intraseqags have low coverage, exemplified by 70-80% of transcribed regions detected by single RNASeq in one sample, consistent with random placement. Tiling arrays are ill-suited to detect low-expressed transcripts. Noncoding in RNASeq is associated with genes, including new exons and promoters. Increased seq coverage in intergenic regions correlates with gene transcripts across 11 Poly+ RNASeq samples. Reads in intergenic display high correlation with neighboring genes or associated with 10,000 novel exons. Genome analysis revealed 2,789 uncharacterized fragments no overlap exons, 1,259 in intergenic. Intergenic transcribed consist of coding and noncoding.
Researchers have developed a computational and experimental method to increase the thermostability of the flavin mononucleotide-based protein Bacillus subtilis YA LO domain by 31°C, making it suitable for use in thermophilic systems. The method involves five steps: single mutant screening to identify thermost candidates, experimental evaluation to confirm positive selections, computational redesign around thermost regions, experimental reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination. This method is simple and effective, applicable to proteins where other methods fail, and provides a tool to improve therability. 

A previous study mutated C62 to alanine, increasing E. coli fluorescence tenfold, but the engineered YLO (FFP) has moderate therability. A more therable FFP is desired for anaerobic microorganisms, especially thermophilic ones. The 62% success rate highlights the effectiveness of screening. Locations of thermost sites are shown in Figure 2, with five from the dimer interface, suggesting stronger interactions increase therability. Among tested, V120 has highest (54.2°C). Proteins with stability are desirable. Three engineering methods exist: evolution, consensus, and design. Each has strengths and weaknesses, used to improve therability with success.
Researchers conducted a study on the diversity of Lutzia sand flies and their infection rates of Leishmania and Wolbach species on Barro Island, Panama. Lutzia sand flies are the primary vectors of the protozoan disease Leishmanias in the world. The study aimed to determine which Lutzia species are present, their relationships, and how they are infected by Leish and Wolbach, to mitigate the impact of the disease on humans. DNA sequences were used to determine the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Phleominae in the understory of Barro Island. The CO1 DNA barcode gene supported morphology-based species determinations, revealing two "cryptic" species, Lu. sp. vespilion within the Vespilion group and Lu. gzi within Lutzia-crata. Leish DNA was detected in 43.3% of Lu. trapi, 26.3% Lu. gzi, and 0% of other sand species. The ITS-1 sequence obtained from Leish infecting Lu. trapi and. gzi was 93% similar to Leish viannia naiff in GenBank, a previously unknown in Panama but recognized as cutaneous Leish vector across northern and central America. Distinct Wolbach strains were detected in three sand species, including Lu. trapi, co-occurring with Leish. Two species, members of separate clades, carried Leish at high frequency and are likely vectors of Leish to humans or mammals. A single Leish, identified as. naiff, was carried by both. naiff is known to cause cutaneous in America but not reported in Panama, suggesting its range may have expanded or introduced.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DC) and found that mitogen-activated kinases (MSK) co-operate with the transcription factor CREB to induce immediate early gene expression from latency. CREB binds to the major early promoter (MIE) and recruits MS, which phosphorylates histone H3, promoting histone demethylation and exit from latency. This interaction is crucial for chromatin remodeling and viral gene expression. Inhibition of this interaction could be a therapeutic strategy. Biochemical studies showed chromatin bound to the c-fos promoter is resistant to MS-mediated phosphorylation, but CREB binding promotes histone phosphorylation. An adenovirus vectors were used to study the ER-MS-CREB-histone H3 relationship and IE expression from latency. MS binding to MIE before reactivation supports this. IE expression in DCs is sensitive to MS inhibition and HCV reactivation involves histone phosphorylation at latent MIE. MS phosphorylation is dependent on concurrent CREB binding to MIE. Histone phosphorylation is associated with rapid genes, promoting hyperacetylation in a MAP and MS-dependent manner, influencing HCV reactivation.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the protein NOL11 in ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development in vertebrates. N11 is expressed in the developing cranial neural crest (CNC) of amphibians and mammals, and its knockdown in Xenopus results in impaired pre-rRNA transcription, increased apoptosis, and abnormal craniofacial cartilage development. Inhibition of p53 rescues the skeletal phenotype but not the ribosome biogenesis defect, indicating an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to remove ribosome-impaired craniofac cells. Excessive activation of this mechanism impairs craniofac development. N11 is required for optimal pre-r transcription and pre-r processing in Xenopus, and its knockdown leads to nucleolar stress, p53 stabilization, and craniofac phenotype. N11 expression is strongly associated with CNC, required for differentiation and development of craniofac cartilages, but not in other cell populations. Co-depletion of p53 and N11 partially rescues craniofac phenotype but not pre-r transcription. This study reveals a novel requirement for N11 in craniofac development and conserved relationship between ribosome factors and CNC survival.
Researchers developed a high-density protein microarray to identify seroreactive proteins of Leptira interrogans serovar Copenhagen, a bacterium responsible for leptospi, a zoonotic disease worldwide. The study aimed to find new diagnostic markers for the disease, as current tests are limited, especially in early stages when treatment is most effective. The microarray consisted of 2,421 proteins, 61% of the bacterium's proteome, and was tested against IgG from 274 individuals, including acute, convalescent, and healthy subjects from regions with high, endemic, and no transmission. A nitrocellulose blot validated the results, finding 16 antigens distinguishing acute cases from healthy individuals in endemic regions and 18 distinguishing convalescent cases. Some identified antigens, such as Lip32, non-identical domains of Lig, Gro, and Lo22, are known to be recognized by human sera, validating the serodiagnostic approach. Novel antigens, including hypothetical LIC15, showed good sensitivity and specificity for both acute and convalescent patients. This study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptiral infection and identified known seragnostic leptiral antigens recognized by sera of leptpi cases. The novel antigens may be used in new tests and improving current assays for this neglected disease. Further research is needed to assess their utility in deployable platforms.
Researchers investigated the role of melanization in mosquito immunity against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana, using the malaria vector Anopheles gambia as a model. They found that melanin formed on all stages of the fungus, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae, but rarely aborted growth and mycelium continued to grow despite melanization. Silencing TEP and CL8, key regulators of melanization, abolished melanization on hypha but not germinating conidia or tubes. Detection of a layer of hemocytes surrounding germinating conidia but not hypha suggested melanization of early stages is cell-mediated, while late is humoral dependent on TEP and CL8. Microscopic analysis revealed association of T1 with hypha surfaces and requirement of both T and CL8 for phenoloxidase recruitment. Fungal proliferation was more rapid in T and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes, exhibiting increased sensitivity to B bass infections. Melanization significantly retards B growth and dissemination.
Researchers investigated the potential of four compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), myopholic acid (M), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxojirimycin (DN), to inhibit dengue virus (DENV) infection in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypt. The compounds were administered through various methods, including injection, sugar feeding, and blood feeding, and RNA interference (RNAi) silencing of target genes. Injection of 5µM BAF and 25µM M prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited DENV titers in the midgut at 7 days post-infection by 56% and 60, and in the saliv gland at 14 post-infection by 90 and 83, respectively. Treatment with CAS or DN did not affect susceptibility to virus. Ingestion of B and M through sugar or blood meal resulted in various degrees of virus inhibition. RNA-mediated silencing of vPase subunit and IMP gene reduced DENV, indicating B and M-mediated inhibition likely occurred through inhibition of these factors. Route and timing of B and M administration was essential, treatment after exposure diminished antiviral effect. The study provides proof-of-principle that chemical or RNA-mediated depletion of vPase and IMP can suppress DENV in adult aegi, which may reduce transmission.
Researchers investigated the role of cell volume in neuronal dynamics, particularly in relation to seizure, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. They incorporated cell swelling, ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into the Hodgkin-Hux spiking dynamics model, demonstrating a transition between seizure and spreading states in response to osmotic pressure changes. The study revealed a dynamical definition for the physiological ceiling separating seizure from spreading depression, and a second ceiling demarcating spreading from anoxic depolarization. The model highlighted the neuroprotective role of glial buffering against seizures and depression, and provided insights into anoxic depolar and cell swelling during ischemia. The results suggest a unified framework for understanding a range of neuronal behaviors, relevant to developing interventions for pathological states.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLR3 inflamome in response to Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, the causative agent of paracoccidiomycosis, a prevalent in Latin America. They found that murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells responded to P. brasiliensis yeast infection by releasing IL-1β in a Syk, caspase-1, and NLR family member NLR3 dependent manner. P. brasili-induced NLR inflamome activation was dependent on potassium efflux, reactive oxygen species, phagolysosomal acidification, and cathepsin release. Using mice lacking IL-1 receptor, they demonstrated IL-1 signaling plays a role in killing P. brasili by murine macrophages. The study suggests the NLR inflome senses and responds to P. brasili yeast infection and plays a role in host defense against the fungus. Further studies are needed to determine IL-1 and NLR inflome components' role in vivo and how IL-1 activates macrophages for killing activity.
Toxoplas gondii, a brain-tropic parasite, primarily infects nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons in vitro. However, in vivo, Toxoplas is predominantly found in neurons. Research suggests that interferon-stimulated astrocytes, not neurons, clear intracellular parasites, indicating neurons are persistently infected due to their inability to clear intracellular parasites. A novel Tooplas-mouse model capable of marking and tracking host cells interacting with parasites, even transiently, reveals Tooplas shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection. This predilection remains in the setting of IF-γ depletion, infection with parasites resistant to the mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites, or when injecting parasites directly into the brain. Findings, combined with prior work, suggest neurons are not incidentally infected, but Tooplas's primary in vivo target.

Tooplas invades both astrocytes and neurons in vitro, but predominantly interacts with neurons in vivo. Studies imply Tooplas primarily encysts in neurons because neurons cannot clear intracellular parasites, but no studies have directly addressed this in vivo due to lack of techniques to identify cells with transient interactions. A Tooplas strains were generated to inject Cre recombinase into host cells, revealing neurons as the majority of GFP+ parenchymal CNS cells, regardless of time or infecting strain. This contradicts the "astrocy-killing" model of CNS-Tooplas interactions, expanding findings to define parenchymal cells interacting with parasites in vivo. Neurons consistently make up the majority of GFP+ parenymal CNS, regardless of time or infecting strain.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to explain the behavior of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility, a type of cell movement characterized by the extension and retraction of the cell boundary. The model, based on the interaction between actin and myosin, accounts for isotropic contraction, viscous stresses in the actin network, and adhesion. Contraction generates a spatially graded actin flow, which reinforces contraction via myin redistribution and retraction of the lamip boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters retraction, balancing protrusion and retraction shape the lamip. The model shows that motility initiation depends on three dimensionless parameters: myosin contractility, viscosity-adhesion length, and actin protrusion rate. When contractility is strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along straight or circular trajectories, and motility is sensitive to boundary conditions. Analysis of the parameter space shows that contractile motility supports cell turning in conditions with short viscosity-adhesion and fast protrusion causing myin accumulation in a small region at the rear, destabilizing cell symmetry.
Researchers have developed a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in protein-protein (PPI) networks obtained from experimental studies. The method, called geometric de-noising, utilizes the geometric model of protein-protein networks to detect false positives and false interactions and predict novel ones. It achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90. The technique was applied to the human protein-protein interaction network downloaded from BioGRID, predicting 251 interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common Gene Ontology (GO) terms. A statistically significant portion of the predicted interactions were validated in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and BioGRID's newer release. The method outperforms existing protein-protein network processing techniques in terms of false positive and false rates for the largest component of the network.
Researchers have developed a Drosila model to study myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM), a neurodegenerative disease caused by noncoding CT repeat expansions. They tested the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG transcripts and found enhanced toxicity in flies co-expressing both repeats. Expression of the transcripts led to the generation of 21-nt repeat-derived siRNAs that targeted C-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and T binding protein (TBP), which have C repeats in both flies and humans. These findings suggest that triplet-derived siRNAs may enhance toxicity in repeat diseases with antisense transcription.

 Studies showed that noncoding CT repeats confer length-dependent toxicity in brain and muscle flies, similar to mammals. Expanded CT transcripts accumulated in nuclei and affected splicing, recapitulating key features of DM. To understand CUG toxicity, transgenic flies were created with pure CT expansions in the 3'UTR of a protein. These recapitulated major features of C RNA diseases. Given 70% of genes have antisense transcription, the effect of co-expressing CT and CAG transcripts was tested. Co-expressing CAG with CT repeats resulted in enhanced toxicity and generation of repeat-derived siRNAs.

Triplet repeat expansions in noncoding regions cause several human diseases, including DM, fragile X, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Huntington's disease. DM, SCA, and HD2 are caused by CT expansions. Antisense occurs widely in the genome, defining potential roles and impact on repeat diseases may provide insight into pathogenesis. Drosila has been used to study neurodegenerative diseases relevant to humans.
Researchers have re-examined the phylogeny and virulence of the soft rot pathogen Pectacterium sp. SCC3, isolated from a diseased potato in Finland in the 1980s. Genomic approaches revealed that SCC3, previously classified as P. carotorum, is now accurately classified as P. wasiae. The revised phylog of P. carorum and P. wasiae strains indicates P. wasiae has been present in potato fields worldwide. A combination of genomic and in planta experiments identified features that separate SCC3 and P. wasiae from other soft bacteria, including the absence of a type III secretion system contributing to virulence in other soft species. Experimentally established virulence determinants include a putative transcription regulator SirB, two redundant type VI systems, and horizontally acquired clusters Vic1 and Vic, containing vir genes. The genome also revealed traits related to life in planta or environmental conditions, such as a benzoic acid/salicy acid carbox methyltransferase of eukary origin. This work indicates soft bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits used in the poorly understood stage in planta. The genomic comparison of SCC3 to sequenced Pacter strains, including P. was, provides a basis for further investigation of virulence and phylog of soft bacteria and potentially other.
Researchers investigated the changes in mitochondrial protein expression in cells with depleted of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using network analysis of gene expression data. They found that proteins involved in typical mitochondrial functions were down-regulated, while proteins responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation and protein transport were upregulated. A comparison of proteome and transcriptome data showed that cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating protein expression and transport. The study demonstrates that protein composition changes remodels mitochondrial networks in response to dysfunctional states, providing a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mtDNA damage is involved in many diseases and likely drives aging and apoptosis. The study analyzed systemic alterations of protein expressions using integrative network analysis. A data-integrative approach was used to select reliable proteins for network analysis, applying isotope-coded tag quantitative analysis to compare protein abundances in mitochondria from normal and mt-depleted osteosarcoma cells. Downregulated proteins were associated with basal functions such as energy production, metabolism, and protein folding in mitochondria. Results suggest expression of control proteins in different modules is regulated under dysfunctional states. Cells can monitor and respond to changes in conditions through nuclear expression alterations.
Researchers have developed a method to deduce the kinetics of protein synthesis in vivo from transition rates measured in vitro. The method involves two components: introducing the kinetic distance, a concept to compare kinetics of multistep processes in different environments, and minimizing the kinetic distance between in vitro and in vivo processes. The kinetic distance is logarithmically related to transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of free energy barriers. To demonstrate the method's power, it was applied to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. The process was described by a cod-specific Markov model with three pathways corresponding to initial cognate, near-cognate, and non-cognate tRNA. Transition rates were determined in vitro and then predicted in vivo by constrained minimization, validated by three sets of in vivo data: cod-dependent speeds, cod-specific dynamics, and missense frequencies. Agreement was found between theory and experiment without adjusting parameters. Deduced in vivo rates led to smaller frequencies than in vitro, primarily due to improved initial tRNA selection. The method is relatively simple computationally and can be applied to biomolecular processes with detailed in vitro kinetics.
Researchers estimated the short-term mutation and recombination rates of Helicobacter pylori by sequencing 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates, including 34 pairs of sequential samples and 29 single isolates from 10 families. The accumulation of sequence diversity increased with time in a clock-like manner in sequential isolates. Approximate Bayesian computation estimated short-term mutation rate 1.4×10^-6 to 4.5×10^-6 per nucleotide per year, with three times as many substitutions introduced by recombination as mutation. Long-term rate over millennia 5-17 fold lower due to purifying selection of non-synonymous mutations. Short-term rates vary in bacterial species, spanning several orders of magnitude, e.g., 4.10^-9 per year for Escherichia coli and Salmonella divergence. H. pylori short-term rates 1.4×10^-6 to 4.5×^-6 per year. Long-term rate 5-17 fold lower due to purifying selection.
Researchers have discovered that melanopsin, a pigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in visual perception beyond driving reflex responses such as circadian entrainment and pupillary movements. Using reporter lines, they found melanin projections extend to the dorsal geniculate nucleus, the origin of thalamocortical neurons, and support physiological responses in the visual cortex in mice lacking rods and cones. Chromatic stimuli isolated melanin responses in mice with intact visual systems reveal melanin input to 40% of neurons in the geniculate nucleus show sustained activation to light. Melanin input increases firing rate of these neurons, indicating melanin encodes irradiance. This is confirmed in melanin knockout mice. The study establishes melanin-based photoreception as a source of sensory input to the thalamocortical system, providing irradiance information, allowing responses in the absence of rods and cones. Melanin is a potential origin of visual perception and may support vision in retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection leads to a significant depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies. This study investigated the impact of CD4+ cell depletion on humoral responses to mucosal antigens in HIV-1-infected individuals. A comprehensive analysis of systemic humoral responses to intestinal microbiota revealed reduced IgG responses to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmutes, but not Bacteroidetes. Intestinal secretions of antiretroviral-treated HIV-1-infected individuals showed significant elevation of IgM and decreased IgA/Ig and IgG/Ig ratios to various microbial and food antigens. The findings indicate reduced mucosal B cell competence for class recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to gut antigens. Decreased microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to microbial translocation across the mucosal barrier and systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. The study found elevated total and antigen-specific IgM in intestinal secretions, reduced IgG/Ig and IgA/Ig ratios to microbial and food antigens, reduced Ig to Proteobacteria and Firmutes in plasma, and a negative correlation between CD4 counts and Ig levels. Altered mucosal humoral responses in HIV-1-infected may be due to depleted or altered CD4+ TF and TFR cells, warranting further investigation. The study shows low interdependence of Ig responses between intestinal and systemic compartments. ART-treated HIV-1 individuals exhibited increased IgM and decreased Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios to mucosal antigens, indicating lack of help for class recombination. Altered isotype response may promote local inflammation and mucosal damage. HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4 counts showed reduced Ig to Proteob and Firmutes.
Researchers propose a new model for population dynamics in ecosystems, where growth of one species is balanced by reduction of others due to availability of resources. Unlike traditional models, this mechanism is driven by abrupt collapse of a single species, freeing resources for others. This is relevant for communities with strain-specific collapses, e.g. by bacteriophages or infectious diseases. The emergent dynamics is characterized by 'diversity waves' triggered by collapses, with diversity peaking at beginning and decreasing exponentially afterwards. Species have bimodal time-aggregated distribution with lower peak by recently collapsed or introduced species and upper not yet collapsed. Waves have self-organized peak structure with long memory across waves, resulting in scale-free distribution with exponent 1.7. The model is robust to variations in rules such as diffusion, growth and extinction rates, and bet-hging strategies. Simulations preserve patterns of collapse dynamics and time-aggregated distribution for most species. The fitness definition of a species by long-term growth rate is inappropriate, as growth is zero in this model. Population dynamics in saturated environments is described by neutral community models with deterministic differences in resource utilization. This model introduces episodic collapses with species sharing same environment, limiting growth. A collapsed population is replenished by individuals diffusing from other environments, with collapse probability increasing with population size. Growth results in steady state at carrying capacity, with diversity waves at longer timescales.
Researchers have re-examined the chemotaxis of Escherichia coli, a well-studied paradigm of simple behavior, and found an additional mechanism of navigation. Chemotaxis is the ability of bacteria to follow chemical gradients, which is crucial for their survival and evolution. E. coli follows gradients by comparing chemector concentrations along its run, a strategy efficient for its size and speed. Concentration differences are detected by a sensory system and transmitted to modulate flagellar rotation, decreasing tumble probability and reorientation if change is positive. This regulation is sufficient to explain chemactic drift up the gradient, assumed only mechanism of E. coli chemaxis. However, simulations predict an additional mechanism: tumbling probability and reorientation also depend on swimming direction along the gradient. The difference in tumbling angles up and down the gradient is small, but results in enhanced cellular velocity along the gradient. A new level of optimization in E. coli chemaxis arises from flagellar switching and fine-tuning tumbling. This strategy is likely used by other peritously flagellated bacteria, indicating another level of bacterial chemaxis development.
Researchers have found that the Stat3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of medullary thymic epithelial (mTE) cells, which are essential for establishing tolerance by presenting self-peptides to autoreactive thymocytes and diverting them to the regulatory T cell lineage. Activation of the NFκB pathway in TE precursors is necessary for TE maturation and proliferation, but Stat3 signaling also contributes to TE homeostasis. Constitutively active Stat3 in the TE compartment increases TE cellularity and bypasses the need for positive thymocyte signals, while conditional deletion of Stat disrupts medullary architecture and reduces TE cells. Stat does not affect TE proliferation, but promotes survival of immature MHCloCDlo TE precursors. In contrast, alterations in the TE compartment do not affect cortical epithelial cellularity or organization. The study demonstrates that, in addition to NF, Stat3 signaling is essential for regulating TE cellularity and medull homeostasis.
Researchers used an in silico approach to identify 511 small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in the genome of Clostridium difficile, an emergent pathogen and common cause of nosocomial diarrhea. In parallel, RNA-seq and 5-end RNA-seq were used to globally identify C difficile RNAs and their transcription start sites at three growth conditions: exponential phase, stationary, and starvation. This approach identified 251 putative RNAs, including 94 intergenic regulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 RNs was confirmed by gene-specific approaches. Some RNs, including antisense involved in C difficile autolytic activity, showed phase-dependent expression. 16 c-diMP-responsive riboswitches were detected, with evidence for regulatory control of motility and biofilm formation. Abundant RNs encoded by C CRIS loci may be important for C survival in bacteri-rich gut communities. This study provides a basis for future characterization and identification of molecular mechanisms of RNA-based regulation in emergent enterogen.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein downregulates the abundance of liver-specific microRNA mi-122 by promoting its destabilization via inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymer. This decrease in mi-122 expression results in dysregulation of its functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from liver biops reveals that 22-nt prototype mi-122 is modified at its 3' end by 3'-non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of mi-122 bearing a single nucleotide tail is decreased in liver specimens from HCV patients. Single-nucleotide-tailed mi-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability compared to 22-nt prototype mi-122, with 3-terminal extension catalyzed by unique nucleotidyl transfer activity of GL-2. HCV protein specifically inhibits GL-2, and interaction with GL-2 in cytoplasm is responsible for mi- downregulation. Inhibition of GL-2 by HCV protein affects multiple miRN, including mi-122, by decreasing proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. Sequencing of small RNAs from liverops reveals among top 50 abundantly expressed miRN in tissues, six mi exhibit decrease in 3-end adenylated isomer levels upon H infection. mi-122 levels in human liverops from healthy and H patients are analyzed, showing decreased mi-122 in specimens from patients (66.3%, 72.7%, and 74.1% in H-1, H-2, and H-3 respectively) compared to normal N. Results demonstrate decrease of 23- and 24-nt mi-122 bearing single or dinucleotide in liver from H patients. Non-templ addition of adenyl residues, major modification of mi-122, is inhibited by H.
Researchers have discovered a pattern of acquired immunity to Trypanosoma brucei infection in wild lions in the Serengeti ecosystem. The prevalence of T. brucei infection decreases with age, consistent with an increase in cross-immunity following exposure to the genetically diverse species T. congolense latu, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness. T. bruce rhodesense disappears by 6 years of age in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes, including non-pathogenic subspecies T. bruce bruce. This suggests novel pathways for vaccinations against trypanosomias, despite the complex antigenic surface proteins of these parasites. 

Sereni lions are co-infected with multiple trypan species, including T cong, bruce, and bodesense, and are exposed to cong, kil, viv, and sim. Tryosomes switch surface glycoproteins every 3-5 days to avoid host recognition. This is the first epidemiological evidence of acquired immunity to trypan in any host. It's unlikely innate immunity is responsible, as the pattern is seen only in T bruce and not cong. Observations are consistent with immunity mounted against cong, allowing lions to clear T bruce by 3-5 years and eliminate bodes by 6. Frequent exposure by tse bites accelerates onset and extent, prevalence should be lowest in high-exposure areas, as seen in wood lions compared to plains and bodes regions.
Researchers used mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore the idea that mechanistic models of human coagulation cascades, despite uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, which could serve as therapeutic targets. They tested this hypothesis on a well-studied coagulation cascade model, validated with 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, using 21 published datasets from different in vitro coagulation models. The model simulated platelet activation and thrombin profiles in presence and absence of anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across trials. Sensitivity coefficients, measuring robustness or fragility of a mechanism, were calculated using Monte Carlo. In absence anticoagul, and surface factor X/activated factor (Xa) and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while IX/IX and V/VIII activation and activity were robust. Anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors, classes of anticoagulants, have FDA approval for prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and treatment deep venous thromosis pulmonary embolism. In vitro and vivo evidence supports prediction IXIX activity robust. Results support hypothesis computationally derived points of fragility human cascades as basis for target selection despite uncertainty.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of bacteriophage (phage) interactions with Campylobacterium jejuni, a foodborne pathogen, and a virulent phage in an in vitro system. They combined experimental and modeling approaches to examine the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions. Phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arose, the first phage study to test against in vitro models of ph-bacteria incorporating ph-insensitive bacteria. A simple model fit the data well, confirming inundation and proliferation thresholds are crucial for phage therapy. The model was fit to time series data to estimate thresholds and rate constants, revealing culture-density dependent phage infectivity features. The study demonstrates how empirical insights can be enhanced by kinetic models, emphasizing the importance of in vitro studies for understanding in vivo phage therapy.

A theoretical framework for non-linear properties of ph as self-replicating pharmaceuticals is needed. A PKD model of ph-bacteria was tested against experimental data for C. jej and a virulent ph. Characteristics in vitro may differ from in vivo, but in vitro testing is a necessary step for applying PKD theory in clinical and in vivo settings. Most ph-b studies have focused on ecological and evolutionary aspects, rather than treatment effectiveness. Approaches should be recast in terms of ph therapy to contribute to advancing therapeutic goals. Partially-resistant cells may cause bacterial resurgence, highlighting the need for threshold understanding ph-b interactions. Cells resistant to ph are expected above a certain size, ph is a selective treatment.
Researchers have identified a Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the snail Biomphalaria glabra that plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistoma mansoni, which causes schistosias. This disease affects over 260 million people worldwide, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The snail is an intermediate host for S. mansoni, a trait shared among all digene trematodes. The study found that the TLR, named BTL, was more abundant in snails resistant to S. mansoni infection and its expression increased when challenged with the parasite. Knocking down BTL in resistant snails made them susceptible to infection. This is the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR and demonstrates BTL's importance in snail immune response to S. mansoni. The study contributes to understanding the sn-schosome relationship, crucial for disease prevention and control efforts, as the World Health Organization aims to eliminate schos by 2025.
Researchers developed an ELISA test to detect and quantify IgG antibodies against saliva proteins from the salivary glands of Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis in human populations exposed to these mosquitoes. A cross-sectional study in Tahiti and Moore islands, where both species are present, found that 98% and 68% of individuals had IgG against Aegypt and Aepolensis salivary gland extracts, respectively. In contrast, ELISA on a cohort from metropolitan France, not exposed to Aedes, showed 97% had no Ig against saliv gland proteins. Analysis of cohorts from different entomological contexts showed no cross-reactivity between Aegpt and Aolensis saliv extracts. The Ig response to saliv gland proteins is a valid biomarker of human exposure to bites of Aegpt and Aolensis. This immunological tool will enhance understanding of exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas of high disease risk, and evaluate vector control efficacy in Pacific and tropical settings.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenicity is linked to its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment of macrophages, which involves interference with the host cell's metabolic machinery. Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in infected macrophages with virulent mycobacterial strains confirmed this, identifying a subset of host reactions targeted by the pathogen. The goal of regulation is to integrate macrophage survival with mycobacterial sustenance, converging host and pathogen factors to determine pathogenicity. Macrophage survival sensitizes TB susceptibility to glycemic status, while pathogen ensures virulence contributes to pathology. 

The study examined time-dependent modulations in macroph metabolism after infection with mycobacterial strains varying in genotype and phenotype, confirming M pathity linked to regulation of host metabolism. Pathogenic strategies employed by M were aided by a mycobacterial panel with manifold virulence traits. Glycemic levels contribute to pathity by influencing macroage apoptosis, revealing an additional facet to the relationship between diabetes and TB. Immunity is a determinant of disease susceptibility, but glyc status also impacts innate defense against M infection. The study highlights metabolic dictates pathology of TB, supporting revisiting paradigms for understanding M pathity.
Researchers investigated the role of ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the yeast ZIP3 gene, in meiotic recombination and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly and bivalent formation. Z-3 is required for crossover recombination, and its localization is dynamic during meiotic prophase, shifting from the length of the SC to asymmetric on the SC and eventually to foci marking crossover events. A Z-3::GFP transgene partially complements a null mutation, promoting wild-type levels of recombination but high aneuploidy among progeny, indicating defects in meiotic segregation. The bivalent structure is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting segregation defects result from inability to remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. smo-1 mutants exhibit similar phenotypes at higher temperatures, and smo-;Z-G double mutants exhibit more severe meiotic defects, consistent with a role for SUMO in SC assembly and bivalent differentiation. Z-3 coordinates recombination with SC assembly and bivalent formation, a conserved role in Zip3/Z-3 coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis. In C. elegans, Z- remains at crossover sites to restructure bivalent and regulate chias function, suggesting conserved function in coordinating crossover with SC morph. In S. cerevisiae, ZIP3 couples recombination with synaps initiation. C. elegans chromosome undergoes one recombination during meiosis, directing SC disassembly in diplot/diakinesis. Z- foci may correspond me crosso, tested in mutants defective crossover formation. Z- localizes to crossover sites in late pachene and diplot, marking reciprocal exchange.
Aedes aegyptus, a tropical mosquito species, has invaded temperate regions of Europe and the US, posing a public health concern due to its ability to transmit arboviruses and nuisance due to its aggressive daytime biting behavior. This study investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Aeegus abundance in metropolitan and suburban areas in Rome, Italy, which was colonized in 1997 and is one of the most infested areas in Southern Europe. Longitudinal monitoring was conducted along a 70km transect across the urban and densely populated area. Fine spatiotemporal datasets were used to analyze the effect of climatic and socioenvironmental variables on Aeeg abundance. Results showed association between anthropized habitats and high abundance in metropolitan and suburban areas, with "green" islands" of abundance in metropolitan areas, and bim seasonal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures. Increase in vegetation cover was negatively associated with mosquito abundance in both environments. Temperature and rainfall during the sampling period showed Aeeg dynamics in metropolitan and suburban environments. The analysis highlighted a complex relationship between landscape and mosquito abundance, with sticky traps monitored for 18 weeks on a weekly basis. A fine spatiotemporal dataset was built to analyze the effect of climatic and socioenvironmental variables on Ae abundance in 21 stations. The study provides indications to prioritize mosquito control measures in urban areas with high human-mos contact and arvirus transmission risk, and highlights public health risks after summer months with high densities.
Researchers have investigated the role of phthiocer dimoceros (DIM) in the virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) during the early stages of infection, specifically when the bacteria encounter macrophages. They found that DIM participate in the receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and prevention of phagosome acidification. The effects of DIM require changes in membrane fluidity, as demonstrated by experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs that abolished the differences in phagocyt efficiency and phosome acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. Insertion of a cholesterol probe in living cells showed that the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core changed upon contact with Mtb, while lateral diffusion of cholesterol was unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and consistent with the observed changes in membrane model. The researchers propose that DIM control invasion of macrophages by Mtb by targeting lipid organization in the membrane, modifying its biophysical properties, favoring receptor-mediated phocytosis of M and contributing to phagomal pH driving bacilli in a protective niche.
Researchers have developed a novel analysis method to study the dynamics of small neural networks composed of a few neurons, which is not well described by mean-field approximations. These approximations are useful for large networks but fail to capture the behavior of small networks, leading to differences between mean-field and real network behavior. Many neuroscience problems involve studying mesoscopic networks of tens of neurons, but methods describing small networks are rare, hindering progress in understanding dynamics at intermediate scales. The new analysis is analytically tractable and numerically determines bifurcations in small networks of homogeneous excitatory and inhibitory neurons. For strong inhibition, networks exhibit complex dynamics through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, forming multiple solutions in neural equations. This change is a finite-size effect, revealing differences between mesoscopic circuits and mean approximation. Symmetry-breaking enables mesoscopic networks to regulate heterogeneity, reducing detrimental noise effects on information processing. 

The analysis differs from mean-field with strong inhibitory weights, undergoing a pitchfork bifurcation with multiple solutions emerging. New bifcations occur, enriching complexity. The dynamics of small networks was pioneered by Beer, studying bifurcations with symmetric weights and asymptotic approximations. Most literature deals with 2-4 neurons, while methods for tens of neurons are limited. The work extends analysis to biologically plausible networks with exact bifcation manifolds and less constraints. A finite-size model with excitatory and inhibitory populations is considered. Mean-field provides an approximation, neglecting phenomena like transitions and correlations.
Researchers investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extralesional sites of dermalishias patients using Leish 7RNA as a target. They evaluated the feasibility of discriminating parasite viability by PCR of Leish 7RNA in relation to luciferase activity of transfected intracellular amastigotes in dose-response of Glant cytotoxicity assays. Monocytes, tonsil swabs, and skin aspirates of 28 cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishias patients were screened by DNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR of Leish 7RNA genes and transcripts. 7RNA amplification coincided with lucifer activity, confirming parasite viability. Of 22 patients presenting DNA in extraional samples, Leish 7RNA genes or transcripts were detected in one or more DNA samples in 100% and 73% patients, respectively. Gene transcript number amplified from extraional tissues were comparable to lesions.7RNA were detected in 13/19 (68%) monocytes, 5/12 (42%) tonsil sw, 4/11 (36%) normal aspir, and 22/25 (88%) lesions; genes were quantifiable 15/19 (79%) monocytes, 12 (92%) tons sw, 8 (73%) normal aspir. Viable parasites present in extraional sites, including monocytes, tons, and skin of dermalias patients. Leish 7RNA is informative for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of leishias. The correlation number of 7RNA transcripts with dose-dependent reduction of parasite in response to Glant substantiates the validity of this target as a viability marker.
Researchers investigated the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing in Drosila using a comprehensive dataset of 95 chromatin-binding proteins (CBPs) and histone modifications (HMs). They found that combinations of CBPs and pairwise interactions between HMs can predict DNA replication timing with high accuracy across the genome and cell types. A simplified model of the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication was derived using independent feature importance analysis, achieving 80% of the full model's accuracy with six terms. Pairwise HMs also predicted differential replication timing across cell types. The study supports the existence of combinatorial HM patterns for DNA replication and identifies cell-type key elements for further investigation.
Researchers investigated the spread of Dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, and 3 in Brazil using a statistical framework of complete genome sequences. They found that new lineages of all three serotypes were introduced within 7-10 year intervals, likely from the Caribbean to North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and dispersed at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. Joint analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data indicated that transportation of humans and/or mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation or geographical distances, determined Dengue virus spread in Brazil. The study used 178 Brazilian genome sequences to determine factors of Dengue dispersal on a country scale using GL spatial model. Predictors of viral spread included geographic distances, air traffic, Aedes aegypt infestation, human densities, and spatial area of each location at regional level (k=5). Results supported a human role in spread of Deng through transportation of humans/or vectors. Introduction of new lineages was followed by epidemic amplification in 7-10 cycles. Periodic Dengue ser-specific incidence peaks coincided with introduction of new line in Brazil every 7-10 years.
Researchers investigated how differences in the organization of receptive fields (RF) across three parallel sensory maps in weakly electric fish influence correlations between activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Using a model based on anatomical differences in RF center size and overlap, they initially predicted large differences in correlated activity across maps. However, in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that electrosensoryram neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this result, they incorporated RF surround effects into the model, varying both RF gain and size relative to center, and found multiple structures gave similar correlations. Incorporating physiological RF differences between maps in the model resulted in similar correlation levels. This suggests RF overlap alone does not determine correlations, important for understanding RF's influence on neural activity. The study is the first to quantify and compare correlations between pyram neuron activities across all three maps, using a combination of modeling and electrophysiology. In vivo recordings revealed identical levels of correlation across all segments. The antagonistic center-surround organization of RF was considered to explain the result. Other studies have focused on spiking nonlinearity's influence on correlation, while less is known about RF's effect on activity. This study in sensory systems with well-characterized RF and anatomical structure aids understanding of RF's influence on correlations. Different RF-surround combinations gave identical correlations in the model, with sign and magnitude determined by positively and negatively correlated inputs. Pyram cells in maps display antagonistic center-surround RF, similar to retinal ganglion cells in the visual system.
This study investigates the impact of noise correlations between neurons on population coding performance in a general setting with no assumptions about tuning curves or heterogeneity. The results provide insights into the role of noise in population coding, summarized in the form of theorems and illustrated with numerical examples. The main contributions are: (1) the "sign rule" (SR) states that if correlations between neurons have opposite signs to signal correlations, performance improves compared to independent case, holding for different metrics and levels of heterogeneity; (2) SR is not a necessary condition for good coding, and diverse correlation structures can improve performance, some violating SR; (3) a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for performance in noise to be as good as without noise. A mathematical setup investigates how performance changes with varying correlations, making no assumptions about curves or heterogeneity. The results provide general insights into population coding. An example illustrates distinct regimes with properties of noise leading to optimal coding. The "sign rule" states that correlations opposite to signal improve performance, demonstrated in literature and formally for homogenous correlations. Theorem 1 establishes SR for pairwise neurons with consistent signal correlations, holding for heterogeneous populations. Conditions for chosen correlations to yield performance as good as deterministic responses are identified, satisfied with high probability for large populations.
Researchers investigated the impact of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics in chronic coinfections. They found that Pseudas aerugin alters S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner and identified three interactions that either antagonize or potentiate antibiotic activity against S. aure. Pseud aerugin Las endopeptase potentiates vancomycin activity by facilitating proton-motive-independent uptake, while 2-hepty-4-hydroquinoline N-oxide (HQ) induces multidrug tolerance in S. aure through respiratory inhibition and ATP reduction. The production of these factors varies between clinical isolates and corresponds to their capacity to alter S aureus antibiotic susceptibility. Vancom treatment of S aure mouse burn infection is potentiated by the presence of Las-producing Pseud aerugin population. The study demonstrates that susceptibility is complex and dependent not only on the pathogen genotype but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the environment.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) in patients with deng virus (DENV) infection, which can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. They found that patients with deng had higher levels of von Wille factor (VWF), a protein involved in blood clotting, and platelets bound more VWF to their surface. The amount of VWF on platelets correlated with plate count. Sialic acid, a molecule on plate surface, was reduced in deng patients, assessed by lectin binding. Sial acid is neuraminidase-labile, but deng virus has no neuraminidase activity. No neuraminase activity was detected in deng plasma and transferrin was not desialylated. In contrast, VWF binding to glycoprotein 1 on platelets using V-activating protein resulted in sial removal by plate neuraminase to plate surface. Neuraminase inhibitor oseltiv reduced V-induced plate desial. The study shows excessive V binding to platelets in deng results in neuraminase-mediated desial and clearance.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism in the human genome called bidirectional promoters, where two adjacent genes with opposite transcription start sites are controlled by a shared regulatory region called a bidirectional promoter. These promoters are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair and may play a role in cancer development. Using a database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), they found the most comprehensive collection of human genes under bidirectional promoters and discovered new promoters that function as alternative or novel transcripts. A significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters was found in somatic cancer genes, including breast and ovarian cancer. The use of this structure in the genome suggests it regulates co-expression among groups of genes. Microarray data from 79 human tissues verified regulatory networks controlled by bidirectional promoters, with subsets containing similar transcription factor sites including conserved ETS, ERBB, FCD, and BRCA. The regulation of genes in co-expression, especially in cancer, is a step toward defining molecular events contributing to disease.

A new algorithm was developed to map bidirectional promoters in the genome using ESTs. The set of bidirectional elucidates relationships among regulated by promoters through co-expression. A subset of promoters regulating breast and ovarian cancer genes contain common transcription sites. Misregulation of bidirectional, especially with common sites, is a plausible scenario for cancer development. Experimental data confirmed expression of flanking transcripts for 91%, 58%, and 65% of promoters in Genes, mRNA, and EST datasets. Enrichment of bidirectional with DNA repair genes implies a link to cancer pathways. Data confirm association with somatic cancer and indicate type relevant. Bidirectional associated with uter and ovarian cancers were examined. Expression-clustering suggested bid should not be classified as one network or divided into pairs. Ovarian genes showed intermediate relationships between extremes.
Researchers conducted a whole-genome analysis of 37 fly species from 22 different Diptera families to uncover hidden diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes. They found over a dozen different sex configurations, with the dot chromosome repeatedly used as the sex chromosome, reflecting the ancestral kary of higher Diptera. Some species have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others replaced the dot as sex, or incorporated up to three chromosomal elements into sex, and some have female heterogamy (Z sex) chromosomes. Transcriptome analysis showed dosage compensation evolved through upregulation of single X in males, but X chromosomes have gene deficiency with male-bi expression, possibly due to sex selective pressures. This diversity provides a resource to study sex biology in a comparative manner, showing similar forces shaped unique sex chromosomes in fly taxa.
Researchers investigated the presence of Zika virus (ZIK) antibodies in mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and those who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009-2012. They tested maternal blood for ZIK IgM and IgG antibodies using commercially available ELISA kits. Blood from one mother who delivered a baby with microaly tested positive for ZIK IgM (16.6%) and three tested positive for ZV IgG (50%). ZV showed a trend with microaly. ZV IgG positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those negative for Z IgG (OR=11.0, 95% CI=0.8-147.9, p=0.083). Similarly, ZV IgM positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those negative for IgM (OR=6.8, 95 CI=0.2-195.1). Data suggest a link between ZV infection and microaly and presence of Z cases in the US as early as 2009.
Researchers investigated the transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), in the Ashanti region of Ghana by tracking infections to specific water bodies using Variable Number Tand Repeat (VN) typing. Environmental samples from 10 water bodies in four endemic communities were genotyped with four VN loci from the MU99 genome, and compared to 14 confirmed BU patient samples. Polymorphism was confirmed by sequencing. MU was found in three types of water, significantly higher in biofilm. Four genotypes, W, X, Y, and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other genotypes were only found in water. A mouse with characteristic BU lesion was infected with MU. The study suggests patients were infected from community water bodies and that small mammals within communities may be susceptible to MU. Transmission may involve contact with environments and water acting as vehicles for disseminating strains.
Researchers analyzed a comprehensive database of 27,723 records of 971 alien bird species worldwide to investigate the global distribution of alien species richness and its drivers. They found that the origins and identities of introduced birds were largely driven by European colonialism, mainly from Britain, but recent introductions involve more species and countries, driven by increasing economic activity. Global bird species richness is highest at mid-latitudes and determined by anthropogenic factors, notably the number of introduced species, "colonization pressure". Environmental factors also play a role, with native and alien species positively associated. Colonization pressure is key to understanding species richness, areas with high native species resistance to alien colonization at a global scale, emphasizing ongoing threats from species introductions. The study uses birds as a model, underpinned by a database of alien species worldwide, combining colonization with abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify determinants of variation in species richness. Global patterns of species are determined by human and biotic factors. Regions with high species richness are located in temperate mid-latitudes, former colonies, developing countries, high GDP, and high colonization pressure.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a multi-HMG-box protein that plays a crucial role in RNA polymerase I (RPol I) transcription, but its DNA sequence selectivity and ability to form nucleosome-like protein complexes suggest a broader function in chromatin structure. Depletion of UBF reduces the number of actively transcribed ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, but has little effect on rRNA synthesis or cell proliferation, leaving its requirement for R I transcription unclear. Using gene deletion mice, U is shown to be essential for embryo development beyond morula. Conditional deletion in cultures reveals U is essential for rRNA transcription and defines chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences. Loss U prevents formation of SL/TIFB initiation and recruitment RPI-R3/T1 complex, accompanied by H3K9, histone H1, and HPα, but not de novo DNA methylation. Genes retain p-acetyl4 and H2, suggesting rRNA can maintain potentially active state. In contrast, histone H1 binding is dependent on U, suggesting positive role in activity. Unexpectedly, rRNA synthesis does not suppress transcription 5, tRNA or snRNA, or expression hundred genes in ribosome biogenesis. Loss U induces formation of large subnuclear structure resembling nucleolar body (NPB) of oocytes and embryos. These somatic NPB contain rRNA synthesis factors but not associate r gene loci (NOR).
Research on the role of Wingless/Wnt in adult intestinal compartmentalization in Drosophila has revealed a new understanding of its long-range action in tissue patterning. Contrary to the conventional model that secretion and movement of Wingless from its source are essential for patterning, a membrane-tether form of Wingless produced viable adults with normal morphology, suggesting dispensability of secretion and movement. In the adult intestine, Wingless gradients demarcate major boundaries between compartments, and its critical roles include regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling with Decaplegic pathway. Tethering Wingless disrupts these roles, indicating direct long-range action of Wing in pattering is required. This is supported by previous studies in larval wing, and has implications for development, homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The adult gut forms through distinct mechanisms during metamorphosis and faces functional demands, including epithelial turnover and regeneration. W pathway activation in the intestine was controversial, but resolved by studies on conserved pathways Wingless and Decaplegic. W pathway inhibition in epithelium indicates W secretion and movement are critical for proper W activation during gut development. This identifies a context where direct and long action of Wing in patter is unambiguous.
Researchers investigated the role of urokinase plasogen activator (uPA) in the pathogenesis of Group A streptococcus (GAS), a bacterium responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. They found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of host plasogen activators, streokinase was required for surface plmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of streokin, uPA was sufficient to promote surface plmin acquisition by strain 544 during incubation with plmin or human plasma. GAS also activated zym pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess u's contribution to invasive disease, a transgenic mouse model was employed. C57/BL/6 and AlbG mice expressing human plmin transgene were more susceptible to invasive disease than u− mice. Decreased virulence in u− mice correlated with reduced dissemination and surface plmin by GAS. These findings have implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and targeting plmin activation in bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of Type IV secretion system components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host interface. Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori is a risk factor for gastric cancer development. The H. pylori pathogenic island (cPAI) encodes components of a Type IV system (T4) that translocates the oncoprotein Cag into gastric epithelial cells, and Cag is a component of cTSS that binds host αβ1 integrin. A mass spectrometry-based approach revealed co-purification of Cag, C (integrin-binding protein), and C (protein with sequence similarity to C). These proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in cPA and detectable on the bacterial surface. All proteins are required for C translocation into host cells and H. pyl-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells; however, proteins are not homologous components of T in other species. Scanning microscopy analysis shows these proteins involved in pilus formation between H. pyl and epithelial cells. Δag and Δ mutant strains fail to form pilus, whereas Δ strain exhibits hyperiliated phenotype and produces elongated pilus compared to wild-type. This suggests pilus dimensions regulated by. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide present in, C, C, and C. Deletion motifs abrogates C translocation and IL-8, and motifs C-terminal C and are for pilus formation.
Researchers conducted a study to identify biomarkers of protection against bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle using global transcriptome analysis. They vaccinated calves with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or a heterologous BCG prime-adenoviral vectored subunit boosting protocol and challenged them with Mycobacterium bovis (M. bo). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated control cattle were analyzed by RNA sequencing, revealing 668 differentially expressed genes. Cytokine-cytokine interaction was the most significant pathway, with Interleukin-22 (IL-22) identified as the dominant predictor of protection, alongside Interferon-gamma (INF-γ). The study confirmed the importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy in an independent set of PB samples from BCG vaccinated and unaccinated calves. BCG vaccination induced protective immunity in some calves, with resolution of M. bo infection, similar to humans with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Promising strategies have improved upon BCG, but it remains the prototype to judge novel vaccine efficacy. Predicting success after vaccination before pathogen exposure is crucial for vaccine development. Previous studies showed BCG induced cell-mediated immunity with strong INF-γ production. Several strategies improved B efficacy, including subunit, DNA, protein, and recombinant vaccines. No reliable immunological correlates of protection exist.
Researchers investigated the role of centrosomal microtubule components, specifically the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TRC) and AIR-1/AurA, at the apical microtub organizing center (MOC) in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic epithelial cells. They found that G-1, a core component of γ-T, is required to recruit other γ-T components, including MZ-1, to the apical MOC. In contrast, AIR-1 and MZ-1 are necessary to recruit γ-T to the centrosome but not to the apical MOC. Surprisingly, microtules remain organized at the apical MOC upon γ-T and AIR co-depletion and depletion of other microtule regulators. However, loss of G-1 removes a subset of dynamic microules, and the remaining microules grow faster. These results suggest distinct microule centers use different proteins for function and the apical MOC is composed of γ-T-dependent and -independent microules competing for limited resources.
Researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, which is the process of determining the parental origin of each nucleotide of the 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes. Most sequencing initiatives do not phase the genome due to costs and complexities. They used the publicly available GIAB version of the NA78 genome as a standard. The methods included laboratory-based assays and computational approaches that reconstruct phase from sequencing data or population haplotype information. Metrics included error rates, haplotype lengths, proportion of fully-resolved genes, and phasing accuracy between SNVs. A hybrid approach combining population phasing, genome sequencing data, and reference haplotype frequencies provided fast and accurate phasing. Population phasing was enhanced with genome-wide data, and parental genotypes reduced phasing errors by up to tenfold. A majority voting scheme for consensus haplotype construction improved performance and coverage. Regions with phasing errors were identified, including low polymorphism and SNV density.
Researchers have investigated the type-III secretion system in Salmonella enterica, a process used by gram-negative pathogens to secrete virulence factors and flagellum components into host cells. They found that flagellar type-III secretion can occur without ATPase activity, increasing proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels. The study shows that increased proton force bypasses the need for the Salmonella pathogenic island vir-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. This suggests that type-III ATPases enhance efficiency under limited substrate concentrations and are dispensable in the type-III export process. Type-III secretion involves substrate recognition, chaperone release, and unfolding in an ATP-dependent manner. The study demonstrates ATP activity is not necessary for protein export via type-III systems. The proposed function of the TSS-associated ATP complex is to deliver substrates to the apparatus and ensure efficient unfolding. Increased proton motive force assists export of late substrates, overcoming the requirement for the FliJ ATPase complex. This has implications for the evolution of bacterial flagellum and type-III systems. The flagellar biogenesis in Salmonella is mediated by a flagellar type-III system, with core components evolutionarily related to virulence type-III systems. Elimination of proton force inhibits flagellar type-III secretion, while ATP hydrolysis energizes chaper release and secretion.
Researchers employed chemical reaction network theory to investigate the capacity for bistability in over 40,000 simple gene regulatory networks (GRNs) consisting of two transcription factor (TF)-coding genes and their associated proteins. They found that approximately 90% of these networks exhibited bistability, including some without the typical cooperativity associated with bistable systems, and most of which could only be identified through subnetwork analysis. The two-gene family of networks was topologically sorted based on the presence or absence of biochemical reactions, revealing eleven minimal bistable networks (i.e., bistable networks not containing smaller bistable subnetworks). The large number of previously bistable topologies suggests switch-like behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not easily lost through evolution. The study integrated publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to identify GRNs predicted to behave in bistable fashion. A comprehensive parameter-free survey identified 36,771 bistable GRNs out of 40,680, including eleven without TF cooperativity associated with switch circuits. The two-g bistable network can be understood as a set of eleven minimal bistable networks, rendered monostable by removal of one or more reactions. 36% of 40,680 networks are bistable for some parameters, 9% have multiple steady states, and 6.5% monost regardless of parameters.
Researchers have identified mutations in the HY2 gene as a cause of orofacial clefting, a common birth defect with both genetic and environmental components. The HY2 gene encodes hyaluronidase 2, which degrades extracellular hyaluron, a component of the developing heart and palatal matrix. Transfection assays showed that mutations destabilize the molecule, reducing HY2 protein levels. Consistent with clinical presentation, investigations of Hy2- mice revealed craniofac abnormalities, including submucal cleft. Additionally, triatum sinister and hearing loss were found in a proportion of Hy- mice, also incompletely penetrant features in humans. These findings identify a new genetic cause of oracialing in humans and mice, and the first molecular cause of triatum in humans, highlighting the importance of HY2 and hyuron turnover for normal and development.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying mechanosensory regeneration in auditory hair cells, specifically focusing on the tip links that connect stereocilia and convey force to transduction channels. Current models propose a static composition of the tip, with protocadherin 15 (PCD15) at the lower end and cadherin 23 (CD23) at the upper end. However, these links are subjected to sound-induced forces throughout an organism's life and can regenerate, but the molecular details of this process were unknown. A novel implementation of backscatter electron microscopy was used to visualize immuno-gold particles and stereilia, showing that functional mechanotrans-mediating links have at least two compositions: PCD15/CD23 or PCD15PC15. During regeneration, shorter links with nearly equal amounts of PCD15 at both ends appear, mediating mechanotrans currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca2-dependent decay. The mature P15CD23 link composition is re-established, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. The study provides a mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanens function in postotic auditory cells and identifies components of the mechanotrans machinery.
Researchers conducted a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of sera from adult patients with deng fever (DF) and deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF) at the critical and recovery phases of infection. They identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DH, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were up to 5-fold higher in DH compared to DF patients and correlated with higher levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT), indicating liver injury in DH. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in blood, was 1.5-fold lower in DH compared to DF, suggesting decreased capacity for endogenous defense and elevated oxidative stress in DH. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained significantly higher or lower in DH, including chenodeoxycholic acid, a bile acid observed in the critical phase, indicating prolonged liver impact from DENV in DH patients. The study revealed metabolic pathways linked to DH in the critical and recovery phases of deng infection, providing insights into host and DENV interactions between DF and DH.
Researchers have identified and characterized the guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei, the causative parasite of African trypanosomias. GR catalyzes the conversion of guanos 5'-ophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5'-ophosphate (IMP, a key step in purine nucleotide metabolism. Unlike mammalian and bacterial GRs, T. bruce GR has a unique insertion of cystathion synthase (CBS) domain and is localized to glyosomes. Recombinant T. br GR showed distinct enzymatic properties, including increased activity with monovalent cations K+ and NH+ and inhibition by ribavir, a purine analog. These findings suggest a distinct mechanism of GR in T. br compared to its host organisms. Inhibitory effect of ribavir on T. br proliferation was demonstrated in a dose-dependent manner, indicating potential for ribavir as a therapeutic agent against trypanomias.
Researchers used molecular simulations to study how two sodium channel-blocking drugs, benzocaine and phenyto, interact with the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb. The study aimed to understand how these drugs enter and bind to the channel, which is crucial for developing next-generation drugs that target specific types of sodium channels in the body. The researchers found that both drugs have two binding sites in the pore, characterized by non-specific hydrophobic interactions: one above the activation gate and at the entrance to the lipid-filled fenestrations. Three methods independently confirmed these sites, with binding to the gate being slightly more favorable than the fenstration. The drugs can pass through the fenestrations with small energy barriers, suggesting this may be the proposed hydrophobic route for entry. The study highlights the importance of specific residues in directing drugs into the fenestr and forming binding sites.
MyD signaling in dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells plays a crucial role in controlling immunity against intestinal infection with C. rodium. MyD-deficient mice are highly susceptible to various bacterial infections, but the cell-specific contribution of MyD in intestinal immunity is poorly understood. A novel murine knock-in model enabled cell-specific reactivation of functional MyD in My-deficient mice. MyD signaling in CD11+ dendritic cells was sufficient to activate dendritic cells and induce group 3 innate lymphoid cell response as well as colonic Th17/Th cell response to C. rodium infection. Restricting MyD signaling to other cells, including macrophages, T cells, or innate lymphoid cells did not induce intestinal responses. However, MyD expression in intestinal epithelial cells partially protected mice during infection, associated with epithelial integrity and antimicrobial peptide RegIII and acute protein SAA expression. Data suggest MyD signaling in DC and IEC is essential to induce host responses upon C. rodium infection.
Researchers explored the relationship between the prevalence of anti-Ov16 IgG antibodies in children one year after mass drug administration (MDA) and the duration of MDA, microfilaria (mf) prevalence in the population, and the probability of onchocerciasis elimination through mathematical modeling. The ONOSIM model was extended to include Ov antibody seroconversion, assumed to be triggered by the first worm establishing in the host, with seroconversion occurring before or after maturation or after the start of mf production. The study focused on seroconversion in children, ignoring the possibility of seroreversion. Yearly MDA reduced parasite acquisition in humans, decreasing sero rate in newborns and children, while those serconverted remained positive. Microfilaria prevalence in individuals aged 5 and Ov antibody in children under 10 declined with increasing M duration. The association between indicators and predicted probability of elimination was influenced by endemic levels, serconversion trigger, and test sensitivity and specificity. Understanding Ov antibody dynamics is crucial for accurate interpretation of seropre data and endpoint MDA estimation. The study found that endpoint will depend on endemic levels, which should be considered in guidelines for stopping MDA.
Researchers have found that prion strains can change properties when propagated in different environments. When swain-sensitive prions were propagated in PK cells in the presence of swain, drug-resistant variants emerged. This suggests that prions comprise a quasi-population of variants with different properties, where the fittest are selected in a particular environment. Even after cloning, prion populations remain heterogeneous, indicating mutation-like processes occur at the conformation level. Brain-derived 22 prions are naturally swain-resistant, so it was not surprising that pr became sensitive after propagation in cells could revert to resistance. R pr, both propagated in brain or PK cells, are swain-sensitive, so it was investigated if possible to select swain-resistant by propagation in presence of drug. Interestingly, this was not possible with standard PK cells, but certain PK sublines allowed swain-resistant, even swain-dependent (propagated more in presence drug) to be isolated. Once established, could pass indefinitely in PK cells, absence drug without swain dependence. Misfolded pr (P) associated with swain variant was rapidly cleared PK cells than drug-sensitive counterpart, indicating structural differences misfold Pr underlie pr properties. Propagation pr in presence inhibitory drug selects drug-resistant pr, even stable variants propagate efficiently presence drug. Conformation changes abnormal pr protein underlie adaptations.
Researchers conducted an exhaustive analysis of the genotype-phenotype space for 101 central metabolisms that encode all possible subsets of 51 reactions in carbon metabolism. They used flux balance analysis to predict viability on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 102 potential phenotypes. Viable metabolisms with one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, but their numbers exceed 109 for phenotypes. Metabolisms with one phenotype form a network of genotypes extending throughout genotype space, where two genotypes can be reached through single reaction changes. Minimal genotype distance between different phenotypes is small, allowing metabolisms to reach novel phenotypes on new carbon through few genic changes. Exceptions exist for metabolisms with complexity near minimum viability threshold. Increasing complexity enhances conservation and innovation potential.

They analyzed neighborhoods of metabolisms on same carbon for novel phenotypes and found that accessibility depends on genotype location in space. Randomly sampled 1000 pairs of metabolisms differing in reactions, representing phenotypes as binary strings of viability or inviability on carbon. A change in genotype is innovation if leads to new carbon viability. A modest genotype space of 101 variants was used due to carbon's role in energy extraction and limited viability on 10 sources.

Metabolisms can differ greatly and reside in connected networks. They analyzed viability on multiple carbon sources, sampling 1000 metabolisms from each network. Representing phenotypes as binary vectors, they asked if multiple novel phenotypes exist in neighborhood.
Researchers analyzed the genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimata complex, a group of triatomine bugs that transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease, across Mexico and the Neotropics. They analyzed two fragments of the ND4 gene to determine haplog specificity and found lowest genetic diversity where there is most anthropic modification and T cruz infection is highest. Haplog 1 and 3 had higher T cruz prevalence, while hap 2 had lower. There was a significant difference in DT and DTI frequencies in hap 1 and 3, but not in 2. All haplogs had moderate to high haplotype diversity, with greatest differentiation between 1 and 3. The complex diverged from its most recent common ancestor 0.97-0.85 million years ago, with primary divergence of hap 2 and 3. Effective population size of hap 1 and 2 increased 0.02-0.03 million years ago. This study supports the ecological origin of the complex around the Tehante Isthmus and recent divergence of three dimata haplogs with differential T cruz infection and DT specificity, important for vector capacity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFR) is a rod-borne disease caused by hantaviruses, primarily Hanta virus and Seoul virus, in China. Environmental factors significantly affect the risk of contracting hant infections, mainly through their impact on rodent dynamics and human-rod contact. This study aimed to clarify environmental factors favoring rod-to-human transmission, providing evidence for effective FR prevention and control strategies. Ten-year (2006-2015) field data on rod hosts, havirus, epidemiology, and environmental data from satellite and meteorological stations, and rod-to rates were used to quantify relationships among environmental, rod species, and FR occurrence. The study included 709 FR cases. Rod species in Chhou, havirus hotspot, mainly Rattus norvegicus, Musculus, R flavius, and others (R lose and Microtis calamorum) played different roles across land types, all associated with transmission. Some species were with FR in forest and water, R norveicus and flavi with in grassland, M and mus and flavi in built. Rod community was associated with environmental variability. Predictive models based on significant factors validated a good fit: cultivated land predicted highest FR incidence, accords statistics 2015. Spatial FR heterogeneity may be influenced by rod community, associated local conditions.
Researchers have identified a new germline mutation in the HRAS gene, c.35_36>T, in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated Costello syndrome (CS). Analysis of the HRAS DNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild-type and mutant HR minigenes, they confirmed that c.35_36>T results in exon 2 skipping by disrupting a critical exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) and creating an exonic splicing silencer (SS). The HR exon 2 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site, making it dependent on splicing proteins like SRS2 for inclusion. Most cancer and CS-causing mutations are located here, affecting splicing differently. The study shows that CS and cancer phenotypes are not only determined by mutant HRAS transforming potential, but also by exon 2 inclusion efficiency from different mutations. A splice oligonucleotide (SO) that blocks the critical SE causes exon skipping and halts cancer cell proliferation, revealing a potential for new anti-cancer therapies. The most frequent CS mutation, c.34>A, has a modest negative effect on exon inclusion and is high in both CS and cancer due to high mutation rate and modest transforming potential. Other splicing factors like SRS, S3, and S6 are potent oncogenes, underscoring dysregulated splicing in cancer. HR exon 2 is vulnerable and dependent on splicing proteins for inclusion. Mutations in codons 12 and 13 impact exon inclusion differently and splicing efficiency is tissue-specific. Germl mutations in HR cause CS, a congenital disease with growth retardation, tumor predisposition, developmental delay, and heart and skeletal abnormalities. 75% of CS is caused by heterozygous c.34>A mutations in HR.
Researchers have investigated the role of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) in the development of the cerebellum, a region of the brain responsible for motor coordination and balance. They found that inactivating MET3 in mice leads to severe developmental defects, including cerebellar hypoplasia, a condition where the cerebellum is underdeveloped. This is caused by enhanced apoptosis, or cell death, of newborn cerebellar granule cells in the external granular layer. MET3 depletion results in loss of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification, a common RNA modification, leading to extended half-lives and aberrant splicing of mRNAs. This causes dysregulation of transcript-wide gene expression and premature cell death of cerebell granule cells. The study reveals MET3 as a critical regulator of cerebell neurogenesis and transcript-wide gene expression, highlighting its importance in mammalian cerebell development.
Researchers have investigated the role of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in regulating gene expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These factors are essential for maintaining the cells' ability to differentiate into any cell type in the developing embryo. The study found that the combination of OCT, SO2, and NANOG binding is strongly associated with the localization of a coactivator, H3ac and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. They observed that loci bound by OCT, SO2, and NANOG in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. A comparison of mouse and human ES cells showed that less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT, SO2, and NANOG are shared between species. However, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53-63% of combinator binding at enhancers active in early development are conserved. The analysis suggests that the combination of OCT, SO, and NANOG is critical for transcription in ES and likely plays a role in embryogenesis by binding conserved developmental enhancers. The study also found that evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual binding, whereas "regulatory hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues early development are under evolutionary constraints.
AML/ETO, a fusion protein resulting from a chromosomal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21, initiates acute myel leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA. A1ETO interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, A1, by targeting A1 binding sites. However, transcriptional regulation by AETO likely relies on a complex network, as the protein interacts with multiple transcription factors, including E-proteins, and targets other DNA sites. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling identified AETO-dependent transcriptional regulation. AETO was found to co-localize with A1, demonstrating the fusion follows the binding pattern of the wild protein but does not primarily displace it. The binding of E-protein H was rearranged upon AETO expression, and the protein co-localized with A1 and H on many regulated targets. The level of H was increased in primary cells and cell lines expressing AETO. The results suggest a major role for the interaction of AETO with A1 and H in transcription regulation by the protein.
Researchers investigated the role of the Leishmania donani histone acetyltransferase H2 (H2) in regulating gene expression. They found that H2 acetylates histone H4 in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for cell growth and survival. Using real-time PCR and DNA microarray analyses, they showed that downregulation of cyclins CY4 and CY9 caused cell cycle defects in H2-depleted cells. Leish genes are arranged in unidirectional clusters, with genes coordinately transcribed as polyc units from divergent strand regions (dSRs), which initiate transcription bidirectionally on opposite strands. Investigating CY4 and CY9 expression in H2-de cells, they found these cyclins have own specific promoters, activated in a cell-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time PCR suggested these promoters are activated at specific cell stages. Two tiers of regulation exist: transcription of polyc units initiates at SRs, likely constitutively, while a subset have own promoters, some activated cell-dependently. The second tier is sensitive to H10 acylation, resulting in downregulation in H-de cells. This study shows cell-specific activation of promoters in trypanoids, uncovering new facets of regulation in this family.
Researchers investigated how humans infer the intentions of others in social interactions using a game where 16 pairs of volunteers played a probabilistic reinforcement task, with one as "player" and the other as "adviser". The adviser received more information and issued a recommendation, with incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varying over time. A Bayesian modeling framework found that players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning, inferring the adviser's intentions to optimize predictions of advice validity. Volatility estimates also affected trial-by-trial decisions, with reliance on advice increasing when intentions were perceived stable. The model predicted players' interpersonal reactivity (IRI) scores and adviser helpfulness ratings. Results suggest humans employ hierarchical models to infer changing intentions, use volatility in decision-making, and integrate advice with non-social information. A subset of players with changing adviser intentions showed more pronounced hierarchical learning, indicating volatility updated beliefs about advice accuracy. A model comparing alternative models found hierarchical learning best explained behavior, predicting accuracy and stability of adviser intentions. Players' belief-updating reflected advisers' policy, with stable intentions weighted more in decision-making. Those with helpful advisers perceived stable intentions weighted advice more, reflected by reduced volatility and increased values.
Scrub typhus, a disease endemic in Asia, has shifted from a rural to urban setting in South Korea, particularly in Seoul, the country's largest metropolitan city. From 2010 to 2013, national notifiable disease data identified indigenous scrub typh in Seoul, with 88 cases reported. Clinical features of patients from one hospital were analyzed and compared to a control group. Chigger mites were collected in the city using a direct chigger-collecting trap and identified by phenic and 18S rDNA analyses. Infection with Orientia tsutsugushi was confirmed by 56-kDa antigen sequencing. Possible sites of infection were mountain areas (56.8%), city parks (20.5%), vicinity of own residence (17%), and rivers (5.7%). Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gak mountain, one of the suspected sites in Seoul, and 76 (87.4%) were identified as Helenula miagawai and 9.2 as Leotridium scutare. Pooled DNA from miag mites yielded O tsugushi Bong strain. Twenty-six patients showed low APACHE score (3.4 ± 2.7), low complication rate (3.8%), and no hypalemia. The study confirmed presence of indigenous scrub in Seoul and a subgroup with mild features. Chigger H miag infected O tsug within the city found in endemic area. Scrub ty needs to be considered a differential disease and target for prevention.
Researchers investigated the impact of the Caenorhabditis elegans HEN1 RNA methyltransferase homolog, HENN-1, on the RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in the nematode. They found that H-1 has differential effects on two pathways that employ methylated RNA molecules, the 26 and 21 pathways. In the germline, the stability of 21 RNAs, C elegans piRNAs, is mildly affected by loss of methylation and introduction of artificial 21 target RNA does not destabilize non-methylated 21 RN. In contrast, 26 RN display reduced stability and respond to loss H- by increased 3-uridylation. Within the 26 class, ER-1-bound 26 RN are modified by H- while AL-3/4-bound 26 are not. Global expression analysis of h- mutants reveals mild effects, including downregulation of gerine-expressed genes. The study refines understanding of endogenous RNAi in C elegans and roles H1 enzymes in pathways.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and high-throughput glycomics analysis on 2,705 individuals from three populations to investigate the regulation of protein glycosylation. They found that variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 (HNF1) and fucyltransferase genes FUT6 and F8 influence N-gly levels in human plasma. NF1 and its downstream NF4 regulate the expression of fucyltransfer and fucose biosynthesis genes. NF1 is necessary and sufficient to drive expression of these genes in hepatic cells, revealing a new role as a transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in the fyl process. This has implications for regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary disease, heart, and metabolic disorders. Acute proteins have altered fyl in diseases and changes in levels of fylated glycans are associated with several pathological processes, including cancer. NF1 and NF4 are transcription factors that regulate gene expression in liver and pancreas and are key regulators of metabolic genes. The study confirmed role of NF in biosynthesis of GDP-fucose and analyzed NF and NF in regulation of fyltransfer (FUT) genes in HepG and Panc cell lines to assess whether hep factors regulate other stages of fyl. NF knockdown regulated expression of all UT genes except UT8, which was induced upon loss of NF. Identified genes UT, F, UT, and NF are involved in fyl, indicating addition of unusual sugar may be rate-limiting in Nly synthesis.
Researchers have investigated the role of single-stranded RNA in stabilizing the binding of Centromere Protein C (CPC) to centromeres, which are attachment points between the genome and cytoskeleton. Contrary to expectations, the DNA sequence of centrom has little role in recruiting kinetoches. Instead, RNA transcribed from centrom remains within the kinetoch region and is thought to be part of the epigenetic system. The study found that maize CPC, a key kinetoch protein, binds DNA through a localized 122 amino acid region, which is exquisitely sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long single-stranded nucleic acids promote CPC binding to DNA, and types of RNAs that stabilize binding match those present in kinetocho in vivo. Removal of the binding module with HIVase domain causes partial delocalization of CPC in vivo. Data suggest centrom RNA recruits CPC to kinoch by altering DNA characteristics. Maize centrom repeats are undermethyl transcribed and produce stable RNAs bound to chromatin. Centrom RNAs are 40-200 in length, transcribed from both strands and maintained single-stranded, proposed to serve as structural template for kinoch proteins. In vitro and vivo studies show CPC has DNA and RNA-binding capacities, with DNA/RNA domain localized to exon region and required for centere localization. RNA facilitates CPC binding to DNA, providing biochemical mechanism for involvement in centrom specification. Single-stranded RNA has strong effect on binding, suggesting centrom serves as epetic mark mediating final assembly. CPC is recruited to kin by protein contacts then converted to functional by centrom RNA.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the genetic regulation of the placental transcriptome and its role in determining birth weight and childhood obesity risk. They analyzed genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and body mass index (BMI) and found that the placenta, a critical organ for fetal development and postnatal health, plays a significant role in these traits. The study examined placental transcript and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mediating genetic causes of BW, CO, and CBMI using integrative analysis (colocalization and MetaX) and found that GWAS loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI were substantially enriched for placental eQTL (6.76, 4.83, and 2.26, respectively). Importantly, compared to eQTL of adult tissues, placental eTL contribute significantly to anthropometric outcomes at birth (BW) and childhood phenotypes (CO/CBMI). Eight, six transcripts colocalized with BW, CO, and CBMI risk loci, respectively. The study reveals that placental transcription in utero likely plays a key role in determining postnatal size and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity. 

The study found extensive enrichment of placental eTL for GW hits and discovered hundreds of transcripts controlled by genetic variants influencing anthropometric traits, demonstrating that placental transcription and functions defined by identified genes play roles in BW, CO, and CBMI. The placenta is highly relevant for determining not only weight at birth (BW) but body in childhood (CO and CBMI). Identifying genes mediating genetic predisposition for BW, CO, and CBMI is crucial for understanding mechanisms controlling traits and developing prevention. Integrative genomics is a powerful tool to mine GW results. The study showcases influence genetically controlled in utero patterns linked BW, CO, and CB supporting hypothesis.
A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to determine the burden of post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) in an endemic area and compare three diagnostic tools for PK detection and lesion regression after treatment. PK is a chronic, non-life threatening disease, but relevant to visceral leishiasis (VL) elimination, with no standard guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. The study detected 26 PK cases with a prevalence of 27.5% among leishmanial antibody positive cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was highly sensitive (88.46%) for confirmation. Majority of skin lesions persisted after treatment, disappearing 6-12 months post-treatment, with reappearance in two cases after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. A significant number of PK patients remained undiagnosed without active surveys, required in other endemic areas for VL elimination. PCR is helpful for PK diagnosis, referral at district or state level. A well-designed study with more samples is essential to determine if PK patients are free from parasites after treatment and which need longer treatment. PK occurs in 10-20% of treated VL cases in India, 50-60% in Sudan, and 2% of PK cases with no kalaazar history. Unlike VL, PK is not life-threatening, cosmetic values not bothering patients not seeking care, maintaining parasites in population.
Pneumoccal competence development in liquid cultures of Streptoccus pneumoniae is a collective behavior that depends on an exported signaling peptide, Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP), which generates a positive feedback loop. However, the coordination of this population switch is unclear. Monitoring competence in real-time during growth of four pneumocococcal lineages reveals that the shift relies on a self-activated fraction that arises via a growth-dependent mechanism. CSP remains bound to cells during this event, and the rate of competence corresponds to propagation between activated and quiescent cells. A two-step cell-sensing mechanism is validated by measuring development during co-cultivation of strains altered to produce or respond to CSP. Membrane protein Com retains CSP, limiting diffusion in the medium. Competence cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a subpopulation that transmits CSP by cell contact.

Competence propagation from cell to cell provides efficient CSP-based feedback in all progeny. The ability to convert population to competent is restricted to pneumoc and relatives. Pneumoccal competence is a two-step process: a fraction initially switches to CSP-expression; these induce competence in whole. The second step occurs by CSP transmission between cells via cell-cell collision. Spontaneous development at single cell level is interesting to explore stochastic autocrine development. CSP is retained on competent cells of distinct pneumoc line, a feature of pneumoc and central to cell-sensing. Combination promotes gene transfer and pneumoc genome plasticity.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) L2 protein acts as a chaper to facilitate the trafficking of the viral genome (vDNA) from endosomes to the trans-Gol network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where replication occurs. To reach the nucleus, the L2/v complex must translocate across intracellular membranes. The details of this process are poorly characterized. A system based on subcellular compartmentalization of BirA and its cognate substrate was developed to detect translocation of L2 from incoming virions. L translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell arrest causes retention of L/v at the T; only release and progression G/M enables trans across the membrane and infection. Microscopy of Ed-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid shift in v localization during mitosis. At G/early vgress from the T to pericent location, accumulating through metaphase where it begins to associate with chromosomes. By metaphase and anaph the v is bound to mitotic, ensuring distribution into daughter. Mutations in a defined chromatin binding of L blocked trans, suggesting trans dependent on chromatin during metaphase.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to estimate the transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another, using data from competitive mixtures experiments in animals co-infected with two strains. The method is demonstrated using influenza experiments in ferrets and has applicability beyond influenza to other viral and bacterial pathogens. The transibility of one strain to another is crucial in three contexts: within human populations where novel strains compete for susceptible hosts, during pandemics where a novel type competes with existing strains, and with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) that exert selective pressure promoting resistant strains. The framework also estimates the size of the transmitted inoculum, a key for epidemiological models considering emergence and spread of resistant strains. The method improves competitive mixtures experimental design by using multiple donors and estimates the number of infecting units transferred from donor to recipient, aiding parameterization of transmission models. The approach is applicable to other pathogens, requiring consideration of within-host dynamics and competitive effects of co-infection.
Researchers investigated the convergence of light and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling on the ABI5 promoter in Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that BBX21, a B-box protein involved in seedling photomorphogenesis, also plays a role in ABA signaling. Genetic data showed BB21 acts upstream of ABI5 and HY5 in ABA control of seed germination. BB21 interacts with HY5, which activates ABI expression, and negatively regulates ABI expression by interfering with HY binding to the ABI promoter. Additionally, ABI directly activates its own expression, while BB21 negatively regulates this activity by interacting with ABI. The study indicates BB21 coordinates with HY and ABI on the ABI promoter, integrating light and A signaling in Arabidopsis. HY regulation of ABI represents integration of light and A during germination and seedling development. Accumulating evidence shows BB proteins work with HY in photomorphogenesis. Since HY activates ABI, it was investigated whether BB proteins are involved in A signaling. Multiple factors in the light pathway regulate A responses by ABI expression. This study shows BB21, a regulator in seedling photorph, negatively regulates ABI by interfering HY binding to the promoter. Light and A are environmental and hormonal cues controlling germination and seedling development. The integration of external with internal pathways is vital for survival.
Researchers investigated the role of the Mediator complex, a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II, in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. They focused on the Med31, Med20, and Srb/M13 subunits and found that C. albicans shares some functions with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizoscharomyces pombe, such as response to certain stresses and Med31's role in Ace2-regulated genes. However, C. albicans has additional roles in transcription of virulence genes, including morphogenesis and adhesin families. Med31,20, and S/M13 contribute to virulence attributes of C. albicans, including filamentation, biofilm formation, and ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med for biofilm development. Med also affects virulence of C. alb in the worm model. The study found that Med and S/M13 regulate cell adhesion genes differently between S. cerevisiae and C. alb, repressing FLO genes in S cerevis and activating ALS in C. alb. This suggests Med subunits regulate adhesion in distinct manner between two distantly related species.
Researchers investigated the factors contributing to the increased antibiotic tolerance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms compared to their planktonic counterparts. Using a genome-wide functional profiling of a complex mutant population of P. aeruginosa MPA1 in biofilm and plankic growth with tobramycin, they quantified the contribution of each locus to antibiotic tolerance in both states. The study revealed large sets of mutations contributing to tolerance in biofilm or plankic settings, providing insights into differences and similarities between biofilm and plankic antibiotic tolerance. A mixed population experimental design recapitulated natural biofilm complexity, unlike previous studies, and showed emergence of quorum-deficient mutants. The study found a substantial contribution of cellular state to biofilm antibiotic tolerance, providing a foundation for novel therapeutics against P. aerugin bio-associated infections.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Flexible Algorithm for Model Selection (FoS) to analyze complex biological systems with many interacting components and limited information about their dynamics. Traditional model selection algorithms compare a few models or exhaustively search the entire space, which is impractical due to the vast number of possibilities. FoS uses local and non-local search methods to prevent getting stuck in local minima and account for structurally similar processes. It was tested on simulated and experimental data, showing flexibility in handling various structures. The algorithm analyzed cell proliferation of CD4 and CD T cells under different conditions, indicating reduced proliferation in tissue-like 3D cultures compared to suspension. FoS is applicable to various biological problems and useful for data-driven model evaluation of complex spaces. Improved model search and selection algorithms handle large spaces, contributing to research questions. FoS was designed for complex dynamics in large spaces and diverse structures, allowing unbiased inference of parameters and processes. It efficiently searches large spaces to provide systematic description of observed dynamics.
A 12-month follow-up study was conducted in Bolivia to evaluate the efficacy of benznidazole (BN) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease. The study included 103 seropositive children, 73 of whom completed the treatment with some interruptions due to side effects. Serology, conventional PCR, and real-time PCR were performed on blood samples taken before and after treatment, and Th1/2/Th17 cytokines levels were measured. Results showed that 11% of children had both PCR+ and qPCR+, 42% had PCR- but q+, and 47% had both PCR- and q-. IL-17 levels were significantly higher in seropitive children before treatment and decreased to normal levels after one year. IL-17 levels were positively correlated with parasite counts by qPCR. At 12 months, IL-17 levels in non-reactive subjects were higher than reactive or ambiguous, suggesting IL-17 as a potential biomarker for detecting reactivity to BN treatment. Plasma IL-17 levels may indicate persistent T. cruzi infection and chronic inflammation.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary causative agent of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, with approximately 2% occupied by a diminutive transposon called Coria. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight subtypes of the element with four distinct transcriptional ends. Transcription analysis using PCR and lacZ reporter revealed two particular ends encode strong promoters. The strongest promoter activity is dictated by polymorphism Y128 at the right end of the element. Examples of elements drive transcription of adjacent genes, while others express non-coding RNAs. Pairwise comparisons between meningocococcal genomes show more than two-thirds of Coria elements maintain subtype at particular locus due to recombinational switching between elements in single strain. Upon switching, new allele spreads through population by natural transformation, a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for variation in meningococcus. Strain-to-strain variability of Coria and number of strong promoters allows widespread effects within population. Defining strength of promoters by subtypes Cor ends provides resource to predict transcription effects of subtype at locus.
Researchers have identified two genes, Chae and Vel, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostus, which regulate the production of a toxin, Txin, that promotes virulence in maize. Txin production is increased in the dark and decreased in mutants lacking Chae and Vel. Expression of the Txin biosynthetic gene Tox1 is also upregulated in the dark in wild type but reduced in mutants. Overexpression of Vel increases Txin production in the dark and Chae in light. Chae and Vel mutants show altered virulence on Tms and normal cytoplasm maize, indicating Txin mediated virulence is affected. Deletion of Chae or Vel reduces tolerance to H2O2. Expression of CAT, a catalase, is reduced in Vel mutant. Chae and Vel mutants show decreased hyphal growth, asexual sporulation, and sterility. Chae OE are sterile while Vel OE are more fertile. Chae and Vel repress melanin biosynthesis genes, and melanization is enhanced in mutants and reduced in OE. Chae and Vel regulate Txin biosynthesis, pathogenicity, virulence, oxidative stress, development, and hyal growth, and control melanin biosynthesis and asexual differentiation.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of asymmetry in bacterial Nav channels, which have been characterized as functionally asymmetric, but the underlying mechanism unclear. They combined non-equilibrium simulations with two-dimensional unperturbed landscapes generated by umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Methods to study ion permeation through the selectivity filter of NavAb channel. Non-equilibrium simulations showed that two or three extracellular K+ ions can block the selectivity filter in the presence of inward forces, but not outward. The block occurs in an unstable local minimum of the unpurbed free-energy of K+ that can be locked in place by applied forces. In contrast, Na+ move through the selectivity as a unit in a "knock" mechanism in both directions, with no local minimum in the free-energy of Na for block. The non-equilibrium simulations predicted work to break the K block is equivalent to experimentally measured for Nav to induce inward K currents. These results illustrate the inclusion of non-equilibrium in simulations provides information on ion selectivity mechanisms missing from structures or equilibrium landscapes. The mechanism of selectivity in Nav differs from those from structures or landscapes and is consistent with electrophys measurements. Non-equilibrium simulations suggest a "pass" configuration for K in forces can block selectivity and prevent K permeation at negative voltages inward, though unstable in equilibrium. This coincides with experimentally applied potentials for Nav to induce K currents. Molecular simulations predicted unpurbed-free barriers for Na and K permeation of 1-3 kcal/mol, consistent with PNa/PK ratio 20-40 from reversal potentials.
A study compared the intracellular spread of rabies virus in the paralytic and furious forms of canine rabies in a cohort of naturally infected, non-vaccinated dogs. The results showed that the furious form had more rapid viral colonization of the cerebral hemispheres, measured by viral antigen within neuronal bodies and RNA. In contrast, the paralytic form had slower intracellular transport of the virus, resulting in slower viral propagation. The study quantitatively assessed the amount of rabies antigen in cell processes and bodies at different levels of the spinal cord, brain, and cerebrum, and found greater amounts in processes in furious compared to paraly at all levels. This difference was evident even when comparing similar amounts of antigen, percentages of involved neurons, and anatomic levels with 100% positive neurons. The findings suggest host-specific differences in intracellular transport, possibly mediated by cytokines, as previous studies documented greater inflammation in the paraly form. The study extends previous results on neuronal bodies and RNA levels, demonstrating caud-rostral polarity of viral distribution in both forms, with greatest at brainstem and spinal levels in furious.
Researchers have investigated the role of the zinc finger protein CTC in regulating gene expression in Drosophila. CTC is known to act as an enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, but its function in Dophila was only recently characterized. One endogenous CTC binding site was previously identified in the Fab-8 insulator at the Abdominal-B locus in the Bithax complex (BX). Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis was used to identify CTC binding sites in representative regions of the Doph genome, including the 3-M Adh, BX, and Antennedia complex. In vivo CTC binding enabled the construction of a CTC binding consensus sequence. CTC sites in BX mapped to known insulators Mc, Fab-6, and Fab-8, and three additional presumptive insulators Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. CTC is associated with all known or predicted insulators in BX except Fab-7, suggesting a common CTC-dependent mechanism. Comparison with Polycomb target sites and histone modification supports the BX regulation model. ChIP-array analysis of CTC sites was used to investigate regions of the D genome, focusing on BX. CTC is associated with Fab8 and other boundary elements Fab6 and Mc. Mutation of CTC sites in Fab8 reduces its insulating activity, demonstrating CTC-dependent insulating. ChIP analysis of CTC and Su(Hw binding sites was compared. CTC can form clusters and mediate chromatin loop formation, partitioning regulatory elements into domains. CTC is required for Fab8 insulator function in BX. CTC binds a core sequence in Doph and vertebrates.
Researchers have elucidated the mechanism of induced-fit conformational changes in the enzyme peptidyl deformase, a metal-dependent enzyme, upon binding of a slow and tight inhibitor, actin. Crystal structures of the initial and final states, as well as intermediate snapshots during the process, were solved. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives closure of the active site, followed by additional interactions. Biochemical and computational analyses reconstructed the sequence of events from encounter to key binding. A "movie" of the process can be extrapolated to catalysis. This study integrates biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses, providing a comprehensive understanding of the slow-binding mechanism, applicable to broader receptor-lig interactions.
Researchers investigated the role of the thalamus as a gateway for sensory information transfer to the cerebral cortex, focusing on the interaction between cortical and thalamic cells. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thal slices, they simulated a hybrid retino-thalamo-cort pathway and mimicking cortical synaptic bombardment through a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The study found that the efficiency of sensory transmission depends on three factors: the number of thalamocort cells, corticothal synaptic statistics, and correlation between thal relay cells. Counterintuitively, retoc signal efficiency increased with decreased correlation between thal cells, suggesting desynchronized cells amplify transfer. This mechanism could direct attention to specific thal subsemblies and select input to cortex based on cortically-defined priorities. 

At the cell level, input transfer efficiency was measured by spiking probability to excitatory retinal inputs. Combined in vitro and comput approaches proposed decorrelation of thal background activity optimizes retoc signal transfer. A possibility is recording extracellular thal cells, an alternative is intracellular recording to unravel correlation. Several mechanisms contribute to permissive sensory transfer, but cortical control by tunable excitatory inhibitory activity presents advantages over neuromodulation: dynamic and precise. Systematic exploration defined excitatory inhibitory conductances led to an optimal noise. Stochastic facilitation at thal level enhances sensory transfer with decorrelated cortogenic feedback. This may be basis for attentional modulation at thal level.
Researchers have investigated the role of the putative demethylase NM-1 in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that nmad-1 mutants have reduced fertility and defects in prophase I meiosis, leading to reduced embryo production and increased incidence of males due to chromosomal segregation errors. Analysis of the nmad-1 germline revealed reduced DNA replication and DNA damage response genes during meiosis, coupled with delayed replication, impaired repair, and apoptosis of maturing oocytes. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry identified NM-1 binding to proteins regulating DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2, which co-localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin. The majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NM-1, suggesting NM-1 functions at replication sites to regulate DNA and repair during meiosis. NM-1 binds same sites on chromatin as TOP-2 and physically interacts with TOP- in vitro and in vivo, indicating NM- acts on chrom to regulate these processes in meiosis. NM-1 deletion and catalytic mutants have impaired fertility, increased males, RAD-51 foci, and replication rates, suggesting NM- demylation at DNA central to its role meiosis. NM- identified as 6 DNA demase and conserved in Bomby mori and mice.
Researchers have identified adipocyte plasma-associated protein (AAP) as a novel modulator in the early stage of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. CMV is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause serious diseases in newborns and immunocompromised patients. The study found that AAP is necessary for CMV infection in epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and knockdown of AAP expression significantly reduced CMV infection in these cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of AAP in cells refractory to CMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH3T cells, promoted CMV infection. Biochemical studies of AAP and CM proteins suggest AAP participates in CM infection through interaction with glycoprotein complexes at low pH and mediates translocation of tegument pp65. Results indicate AAP plays a role in early CM infection. CM entry into different cells may rely on different receptors and routes, and AAP was identified as a modulator in early CM infection. In vitro interaction AAP and CM proteins supported AAP may participate in CM through glyprotein complexes low and mediate translocation pp65. AAP is a cellular factor augmenting CM infection at early viral stage. Overexpression of AAP promoted CM in human cells and non-human types susceptible to CM entry, canineCK and murine NIH3 cells. Reduced early gene transcription and delayed translocation tegument pp were detected in AAP-deficient cells at CM infection.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model that combines intrinsic and extrinsic factors to understand how hematopoietic progenitor cells commit to a specific lineages. The model suggests that cytokine-mediated receptor feedback can induce a switch-like response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced decommitment. The model supports both instruct and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can bias lineage by regulating inherently noisy cell decisions with complex behaviors such as ligand ultrasensitivity and multistability. Simulations show that differentiation kinetics to a mature state depend on progenitor state and commitment route chosen. The model agrees with lineage receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a framework integrating classical and alternative paths in hematopoies observed.
Researchers have used electron cryo-microscopy to study the ultrastructure of the Bunyamwera virus, a prototypic member of the Orthunavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family. The virus particles are pleomorphic in shape but display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes, each protruding 18nm from the membrane. Upon introduction to an acidic environment, the spikes become disordered. Using subtomography, a 3D model of the trimeric glycoprotein spike was derived at 3nm resolution. The glycoprotein consists of a putative class II fusion glycoprotein with a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts occur between spikes at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike at membrane-dist regions. This trimer deviates from previously observed fusion glycop arrangements, suggesting a greater repertoire of viral glycoprotein oligomerization. The study reveals a pH-dependent conformation change during orthunaviral entry into host cells and provides a blueprint for the structure of this emerging group of pathogens. The glyprotein sequences of Bunyamwera virus are conserved with more pathogenic relatives, sharing 54 and 53% similarity with SBV and ORO, respectively. The study addresses the paucity of information on orthunavirus structure, providing a detailed 3D analysis and model for this medically important group.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on anterior chamber depth (ACD) to discover genes associated with primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) in a population of 5,308 individuals of Asian descent. The study found a significant association with a variant in the ABCC5 gene (rs199), with a per-allele effect size of -0.045mm and a P-value of 8.17x10^-9. This variant was also associated with an increased risk of PG in a separate case-control study of 4,276 PG cases and 18,801 controls, with a per-allele OR of 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.22, P=0.000). The association was strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles were included in the analysis. The study suggests that increased PG risk could be mediated by genetic variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions. AB5 is expressed in ocular tissues relevant to PG such as the iris, ciliary body, and lens. The study provides clues to genetic mechanisms underlying this major cause of blindness.
Researchers have identified developmental enhancers, called bilaterally conserved regulatory elements (BREs), which are conserved between deuterostomes and protomes. These enhancers show sequence and gene synteny conservation, reflecting conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites. Bres are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways and drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. The study presents the first examples of enhancers conserved between deuteromes and protomes, and suggests that more will be discovered as understanding of cis-regulatory logic and bilian genomes improves. Bres are developmental enhancers that encode complex patterns of transcription factor binding, with Bore being an enhancer of Id. Binding analysis predicts it functions as a BMP responsive element, and experimental evidence supports this. In vertebrates, Bore drives expression in the central nervous system during early differentiation. The study implies extensive cis-regulatory rewiring between protome and deuterome clades, and questions what makes Bres unique.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the impact of vaccination on the diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses within individuals. They analyzed 166 cases of H3N influenza over 3 seasons and 19 years, using next-generation sequencing to obtain whole genome data for 119 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminase sequences showed no stratification by pre-HAI and post-vaccination titers. The study found that most intrah single nucleotide variants were rare and few were found in more than one individual, with most samples having fewer than 15 nucleotide variants across the genome. The level of diversity did not vary by day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-antibody titer. Contrary to expectations, the results indicate that seasonal vaccination has little impact on intrah diversity in natural infection and vaccine immunity may be a minor contributor to antigen drift at local scales.
Researchers investigated the efficacy of live attenuated Leishmania donovani parasites (LC-/-) in inducing a protective immune response against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in aged mice compared to young mice. Previously, LC/- was shown to induce a strong innate and adaptive immune response in young mice. In this study, LC/- mediated modulation of innate and adaptive response was analyzed in 18-month-old (aged) and 2-month-old (young) mice. Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from both aged and young mice upon LC/- infection showed significant enhancement of effector responses, augmenting CD4+ Th cell function compared to wild-type (WT) infected BMs in vitro. Similarly, splenic dendritic cells from LC/- infected young and aged mice revealed induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IF-γ, TNF) and downregulation of anti-inflammatory (IL-10) genes compared WT infected mice. Immunization with LC/- induced IgG2 antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro-inflammatory responses, and splenocytes heightened leishicidal activity with nitric production in young and aged mice. Upon virulent Leish challenge, LC/- immunized mice from both groups displayed multifunctional Th-type CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 cells correlating reduced parasite burden in spleen and liver compared naïve mice. However, LC/- induced response in dendritic cells showed no difference between aged and young, but adaptive T and B cell activation in aged was reduced compared young, correlating less protection in old compared young.
Researchers created chimeric viruses by exchanging the capsid proteins between Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68), a respiratory virus, and Enterovirus D94 (EV-D94), an enteric virus, to investigate the role of capsid proteins in viral tropism, acid sensitivity, and optimal growth. The study found that capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient to determine acid sensitivity and tropism in respiratory cells and tissues, as well as optimal growth temperature. In contrast, non-structural proteins modulate the innate immune response. Chimeric viruses with EV-D68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures, while EV94 relied on mutations in VP1 for temperature adaptation. Additionally, EV68 maintained infectivity after acid treatment, whereas non-structural proteins modulated the immune response. This study clarifies the biophysical and immunogenic roles of capsid in EV pathogenesis and may guide therapeutic targets.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-I is a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G (Ig). It also participates in antibody bridging (ABB), a process where antigen fragments (Fab) of IgG bind viral antigen while Fc binds to gE-I. IgFc binds g-E at basic, not acidic pH, suggesting Ig bound extracellularly by surface g-E would dissociate and degrade in endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. The fate of viral antigens with g-E bound Ig was unknown: could remain surface or endocyt with Ig. An in vitro system was developed to study ABB and trafficking of complexes using 4-D confocal imaging with transferrin epidermal growth, characterized intracellular markers. Data showed cells expressing g-E and viral HSV-1 endocyt anti-D Ig and g in g-E dependent, resulting lysosomal localization. Results suggest g-E can mediate clearance of infected surfaces of anti-viral host Ig and viral antig to evade Ig-mediated responses, a mechanism for viral evasion and pathogenesis.
Researchers have analyzed the transcriptome of the protoscoleces (PSC) stage of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasite that causes cistic hydatid disease in humans and animals worldwide. They used Roche 454 sequencing and in silico analysis to explore the excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite. The study generated 26,514 non-reduant sequences, of which 22,910 (86.4%) were mapped to the published E. granus genome and 17,705 (66.8%) were in coding sequence (CDS) regions. Of the 2,280 predicted ESPs, 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 124 in protein metabolism, and 11 in glycolysis/glucone (GLN) pathways. Additionally, 44 antigenic proteins, molecular chaperones, and proteases were identified. Many proteins were enriched in development-related pathways, such as TGF receptor and insulin pathways. This study provides valuable information on parasite adaptation to hosts, aiding novel intervention targets for hydat treatment and control.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidans, the transcription factor NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a major nitrogen source in soil. When nitrate is present, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and activates transcription of nit assimilatory genes. However, the interaction between Nir and the exportin Kap/CRM1 is disrupted, leading to rapid nuclear accumulation of Nir. Researchers used mass spectrometry to find that in the absence of nit, Nir is predominantly cytosolic and methion 169 in the nuclear export sequence (NES) is oxidized to methion sulfox (Metox). This oxidation depends on Fmo, a flav-containing monooxygen which uses methion and cystine but not glutathione as substrates. The function of Fmo cannot be replaced by alternative F proteins in A. nidans. Exposure to nit led to rapid reduction of Nir-Met169 to Met; this being independent of thiorexin and methion sulfox reductases. Replacement of Met byoleucine, sterically similar but not oxidizable, led to partial loss Nir activity and insensitivity to Fmo-mediated export. In contrast, replacement of Met by alanine transformed the protein into permanently nuclear and active factor. Co-immoprecipitation of Nir-Kap interactions and subcell localization of Nir mutants provided evidence that Met oxidation leads change Nir conformation.
Researchers investigated how functional constraints shape the evolution of mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels, which are crucial for propagating action potentials. Since Hodgkin and Hux's mathematical models, sodium channel properties must be tightly constrained for action potential to propagate. Nine mammalian genes encode voltage-gated sodium channels, with many being over 90% identical in sequence, suggesting similar function and tight constraints. However, the multiplicity of genes raises why there are so many. Theoretical constraints on sodium diversity, membrane excitability and unique resting potential, directly constrain channel properties. Data from 172 sets of measurements on mammalian channels, wild-type and mutant, under various conditions, obey excitability constraint, while channels in muscle obey unique potential, but not in neuronal tissue. Excitability distinguishes channels into four groups consistent with phylogenetic analysis. Calculations suggest functional differences between groups.

Researchers have identified the endonuc domain of the influenza H1N1 (2009) polymerase as a potential target for antiviral drugs due to its role in transcription and replication of the viral genome. The unique cap-snatching mechanism of transcription can be inhibited by targeting the PB cap-binding or enduc domains. High-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the enduc domain with specific inhibitors, including diketo compounds and green tea catechin, have been obtained. These compounds chate two manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme. The binding modes of different compounds and a mononucleotide highlight how substituents on the metal scaffold can bind in distinct subockets and the active cavity's plasticity. This information will aid in designing more potent inhibitors targeting the enduc activity of influenza polymerase. The study provides the first detailed structural information on inhibitor binding to the enduc and will guide medicinal chemistry optimization of lead compounds for efficient inhibition.
Researchers have developed an effective immunization protocol to produce potent polyspecific antiven against three medically important vipers in Thailand and neighboring countries: Cryptelytrops alabris (White-lipped viper), Caloselasma rhodoma (Malayan viper), and Dabo siensis (Russ's viper). The protocol, known as 'low dose, low multi-site immunization', was used to immunize four horses with a mixture of the three venoms, resulting in a rapid rise in ELISA titers and plateau at the 8th week post-immunization. The antisera showed high in vivo neutralization potency against the venoms, exceeding the minimal limits set by the Queen Saoh Memorial Institute. The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephroxic activities of the venoms. This immunization protocol is useful for producing potent polyspecific antiven against snake venoms and equine antis against tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies.
Salmonella enterica, a bacterium that causes systemic infections, can persist in the body for long periods despite a strong immune response. Chronically infected individuals are asymptomatic and transmit the disease to naive hosts through fecal shedding, serving as a reservoir for the disease. The effector protein SI, translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenic Island 2 (SPI) type III secretion system, is required for Salmonella typhim to maintain long-term systemic infection in mice. SI inhibits normal migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) in vitro, and this inhibition requires host IQG1, a regulator of cell migration. S binds IQ1 and localizes with it at the periphery. The C-terminal of S is similar to PM/ToxA, a toxin with cysteine residue critical for activity. Mutation of corresponding in S eliminates S function in vitro and vivo, but not IQ1 binding. Infection with wild-type S typhur suppressed migration to spleen in S-dependent manner. Examination of spleens from infected with WT tyur revealed fewer DC and CD+ lymphocytes compared to infected ΔI tyur.
A mobile genetic element SCCm-encoded p-mec RNA suppresses translation of agr and attenuates MRSA virulence. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a problematic pathogen that infects healthy individuals, causing severe disease. CA-MRSA is more virulent than hospital-acquired-MRSA (HARSA). The mechanism of high virulence of CA-MRSA is unknown. The product of the p-mec gene, located in the mobile element SCCm of HA-MRSA but not CA-M, suppresses expression of phenol-solysin alpha (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. Here, we report p-m RNA inhibits translation of agr gene encoding a transcription factor for PSα via binding to agr mRNA. 25% of 325 MRSA isolates had a mutation in p-m promoter attenuating transcription and 9% had no p-m. Most p-mutated or p-m-deleted HARSAs had increased PSα compared to strains with intact p-m and some produced high amounts of PSα comparable to CA-MRSA. Deletion of p-m from HARSAs with intact-m increased expression of Agr and PS and virulence in mice. p-m RNA suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of agr translation and absence of p-m in CARSA causes high virulence property.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in type I interferon-deficient mice, which occurs when maternal antibodies from a previous deng infection enhance the severity of a subsequent infection with a different deng virus serotype. In a previous study, 5-week-old type I and II interferon-deficient (AG) mice born to DENV-immune mothers showed increased disease severity upon DENV2 infection, characterized by high virus titers and vascular leakage leading to death. To replicate this in a less immunocompromised background, the researchers used type I interferon-deficient A129 mice. Five-week-old A129 mice born to D1-imm mothers succumbed to D2 infection within 4 days, whereas those born to naïve mothers survived. Clinical manifestations included hepatocyte vacuolation, vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNF therapy protected mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 did not impact virus titers or outcome. This A129 model of ADE may help dissect mechanisms in deng pathogenesis and evaluate vaccine/therapeutic candidates.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection in humans in the Americas. Fifty-one studies were reviewed, and meta-analysis of effect sizes were used to pool information on each variable. Male sex was associated with visceral leishiasis in studies using the leishman skin test, but not with serological diagnosis. Young individuals were less frequently infected but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher seropositivity nearby, lower socioeconomic status, and vegetated areas were associated with L. infant infection, but not presence of chickens or nutritional status. Ecological studies showed dog seropitivity associated with human VL, emphasizing dogs as a marker of visceral leishias occurrence. This is the first review on factors associated with visceral leishias in Latin America, clarifying disease dynamics and raising questions. However, results cannot be applied to other contexts due to disease characteristics. A review of risk factors in Asia showed spatial clustering, household conditions, vegetation, and poverty. In Brazil, case-fatality rates varied 4.2-10% in treated patients. Diagnosis uses hypersensitivity, parasitological, serological, and molecular methods.
Inhalation of Francisella tularens (Ft) causes acute and fatal pneumonia, with the lung cytokine environment favoring bacterial replication. However, the mechanisms underlying pathogenesis and lethality remain unclear. Research reveals that an innate cellular response, rather than bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives tissue pathology and mortality. Lethal infection elicits medullary and extra-medullary myelopoiesis, recruiting immature myeloid and myeloid suppressor cells (IM/MD) to the lungs, which fail to mature, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of function, and death. This process is partially dependent on Ly6+ cells. Acceleration of this process may account for rapid lethality with Schu4. In contrast, sub-lethal infection with LVS shows a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes, required for protection, suggesting a threshold for lethal infection. Eliciting a mature phagocyte response provides transient protection against Schu4. The study suggests the nature of myoid response determines host mortality versus survival in Francisella infection.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an invasive species that poses a global concern due to its rapid spread and potential for infectious disease transmission. As a vector of important arboviruses such as chikungunya (CHV), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIK), understanding its colonization pattern is crucial for mitigating its spread and disease risks. Classical genetics and Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approaches were used to disentangle the demographic history of Aedesopopus populations from Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. In Southeast Asia, low differentiation and high co-ancestry values among China, Thailand, and Japan indicate native populations maintain genetic connectivity, revealing a common origin in China. Outside Asia, invasion in La Reunion, America, and the Mediterranean is supported by chaotic propagule distribution, maintaining high diversity in adventive populations. Independent transcontinental introductions may have facilitated establishment through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in intra-population variability. This may extend to mechanisms controlling vector competence. In the invasion context, ancestry and admixture create conditions for efficient arvirus transmission and outbreak.
Researchers investigated the factors that contribute to the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wounds, a type of bacterial infection that can be difficult to treat. They found that isolates from human wounds often lacked virulence functions and biofilm formation capabilities, which are typically associated with bacterial pathogenicity. However, these functions were not necessary for bacterial fitness in mouse wounds. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolism, energy production, and membrane integrity were critical. This suggests that bacteria in wounds may be stressed by their own high-density growth, rather than host conditions. The study sheds light on bacterial functions in chronic infections, stresses in wounds, and potential therapeutic targets to prevent infection.
A prospective study was conducted at the Center for Teaching, Research, and Referral for Bancrofilariasis (NEF) to evaluate the occurrence of intrascrot lymphangiectasia, appearance/consistency of the testis, and efficacy of complete excision hydrocele in patients in a bancrofilariasis endemic area. A total of 968 patients with unilateral or bilateral hydrocele (Group 1) and 218 patients from the same area who had undergone hydrocele-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere (Comparison Group) were enrolled. Twenty patients from Comparison with hydro recurrence were reoperated at NEF and constitute Group 2. In Group 1, 1128 hydrolectomies were performed (mean age 30.3yr, mean follow-up 8.6yr). Hydro recurrence rates in Group 1 and Comparison (age 31.5) were 0.3% and 19.3, respectively (p<0.001). There was no recurrence in Group 2 (age 25.1, mean follow 6yr). Surgically leaking or dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in inner/outer hydro sac or surrounding tissue, particularly retrotesticular, in 30.9 and 46.3% patients Group 1/2 (p=0.081). Testicles were abnormal shape, volume, consistency in 203/128 (18%) and 10/28 (35.7) patients Group 1/2 (p=0.025). Lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic is an important component chronic filarial hydro fluid threatening test integrity in adult population bancfilari endemic areas. To avoid recurrence, authors advise complete excision hydro sac when leaking or dilated vessels suture or excised.
Researchers have identified a deubiquinating enzyme, Ts37, in the parasite Trichella spiralis, a zoonotic nematode that causes trichlosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. The enzyme is a cystine protease, orthologous to the human protein UCH5, and interacts with the proteasome, a complex responsible for protein degradation. This interaction has been conserved throughout evolution. The study used an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-V, to identify deubiquinating activity in T spir larvae lysate, and immuno-blot and imm-precipitation to identify potential deubiquating enzymes. LC/MS/MS analysis yielded peptides with sequence homology to conserved human deubiquating enzymes. The gene encoding putative UCH5 homologue, Ts37, was cloned and recombinant protein expressed and purified. Deubiquinating activity was verified by Ub-AM assay. Co-precitation of recomant Ts37 showed association with proteome components, including yeastpn homologue ADR1. Inhibitor LD-44 exhibited specific inhibition of recomant Ts37 and reduced viability of cultured larvae. This study reports the first T spir deubiquating enzyme and suggests interaction with proteome has been conserved.
Researchers have investigated the anti-trypanosomal activity of nitrile-based cystine protease inhibitors as a potential treatment for Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The study focused on two scaffolds associated with cathepsin K inhibition and found that three compounds showed anti-tryosomal activity in the 0.1-1 μM range against the CL Bre strain of T. cruzi, with two compounds having EC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 μM, significantly lower than their Ki values against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzain. This suggests the anti-tryosomal activity may not be solely due to cruzain inhibition, indicating a putative polypharmacological profile towards cystine proteases. The study also evaluated cathein K inhibitors on a cyclohexane dicarbox scaffold, observing anti-tryosomal activity greater than expected from cruzain inhibition. cruz is a validated target for therapeutic intervention in Chagas disease, supported by oral activity of cystine inhibitor K777 in animal models and efficacy of analogs in a murine Chagas model. Potent dipeptyl nitr inhibitors of cruz showed no anti-tryosomal activity, questioning the relevance of potency in kinetic assay as predictor. The results suggest anti-tryosomal effects of potent compounds may be due to inhibition of unidentified cystine proteases, such as cruzain-2, or a polypharmac profile targeting isoforms of cruzain or other cystine proteases in the parasite. The cystine inhibition profile suggests a new antag target may share characteristics with cathein and phenic screening for antag agents should include potent inhibitors of this enzyme.
Researchers have constructed a physical map of the maize genome that covers 93.5% of the genome, with 86.1% aligned to the genetic map. The map contains 25,908 genic markers, enabling 73% of the genome to be anchored to the rice genome. Sequence tags correlate with recombination patterns, with 1 kb in rice corresponding to 3.2 kb in maize. Maize has a 6-fold genome size expansion due to polyploid origin, with most regions corresponding to two in maize. Inversions account for majority of chromosome variations during diploidization. Ancient duplication predates divergence of maize and rice progenitors. Reconstructing paleobotany indicates progenitors contained 10 chromosomes. Alignment sheds light on chromosomes contributing to polloid, rearrangements and diploid, and homologous regions. RFLP mapping shows two maize sets align with one rice and sorghum chromosome, a whole duplication event. Table 3 summarizes primary and secondary duplications in maize. Average 3 copies per over (Table 2) supports tetraploid emergence. Duplications in rice not limited to ancestor. Bands from fingerprint, not simulated, size similar to rice map. A saturated genetic map was developed to anchor contigs along chromosomes. Multiple events contribute to complex pattern, recent duplication easier than ancient. Synteny shows rearrangements since maize and rice divergence.
Researchers investigated the de novo generation of infectious prions, the proteinaceous agents responsible for transmissible spong encephalopathies, in vitro. They aimed to mimic the early etiology of sporadic disease, the most common form of human prion disease, which appears to originate from a low-frequency spontaneous misfolding event generating the first PrSc particle that propagates as the infectious form of the disease. The study used protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PM) procedure to analyze the possibility of spontaneous generation of PrSc. Under standard PM conditions and precautions to avoid cross-contamination, de novo generation of PrSc was not observed, supporting its use for diagnostic applications. However, PM was modified to generate PrSc in the absence of pre-existing PrSc in different species at a low and variable rate. De novo generated PrSc was infectious when inoculated into wild-type hamsters, producing a new disease with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. The results provide additional evidence for the prion hypothesis and a model to study sporadic prion disease, suggesting prion diversity is not restricted to known forms, and new infectious foldings may produce novel phenotypes.
Researchers have developed a novel neural model, the Angular Velocity Unit (AV), to estimate angular velocity in bees, accounting for previously unexplained behaviors in visual odometry and corridor-centering. The model is based on electrophysiological data and tested with behavioral data, suggesting AV can be considered an extension of the optomotor response. The detector is tested behaviorally simulated with the corridor-center paradigm, where bees navigate a corridor with gratings (square or sinusoidal) on walls. When combined with existing flight control, the detector reproduces invariance of flight path to spatial frequency and contrast of gratings, including deviations from centering behavior found in real bees. The detector's response to distance along corridor is constant for a range of grating frequencies, demonstrating it can be used as a visual odometer.

The model, Angular Detector Unit (ADU), reproduces behavioral patterns including unaccounted for in corridor-center response: deviation of flight path from center due to spatial frequency differences in sinusoidal gratings and deviations from center for square and sinusoidal gratings. Identified detectors respond to temporal frequencies 10-100Hz, lower than experienced in bee experiments. Additional circuitry for AV estimation must be present. Neural recordings from ventral cord found distinct responses to moving patterns in bee's view. Odometry is unaffected by environment frequency, suggesting AV neurons could estimate distance by summing output over visual field. The model tested this relationship, results show wide range of frequencies (0.1-10)
Untreated infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambense, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis (AT), have long been considered invariably fatal. However, this study reports on a 15-year follow-up of 50 AT patients from the Ivory Coast, 11 of whom refused treatment after initial diagnosis. Using sensitive diagnostic tools, parasite clearance was observed in 10 out of 11 who continued to refuse treatment, with 7 displaying serological responses, becoming negative to trypanosome antigens (Li1.3, 1.5, and 1.6). Two alternative progressions of AT were observed: aparasitemic and asymptomatic infection with long-lasting serological responses, and spontaneous resolution with negative parasitological and PCR results and dropping antibody titres. This study does not estimate the frequency of these courses, but notes that field programs encounter subjects with positive serological results but negative parasitological tests, indicating some display these infection courses. Recognizing trypanotolerance in humans, as accepted in animals, is a step for future research in AT. 

Human trypaniasis (AT) is caused by Trypanosoma bruce (T.b) gambense and T.rhodesi, with T.b gambense causing 95% cases. The disease evolves from haemolymphatic to meningeal phase when parasites invade central nervous system leading neurological disorders. This study combines clinical, serological, molecular, and parasit investigations, using sensitive tools, the most comprehensive on Tryosoma bruce gambense in humans. Two alternative progressions to fatal observed: aparitem and asymptomatic and spontaneous resolution with negative parasit and PCR and dropping titres.
Researchers investigated whether ionizing radiation selects for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors in vivo using mouse models. They found that p53 disruption does not provide a selective advantage in an unstressed hematopoietic system or previously irradiated BM allowed to recover from irradiation. However, upon irradiation, p53 disruption confers a selective advantage, leading to long-term expansion of p-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. Selection for cells with disrupted p53 is attributed to protection from irradiation-induced elimination of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved maintenance of progenitor fitness, and elimination of competing p-type progenitors. These studies indicate that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing irradiation is partly explained by selection for cells with p disruption, which protects progenitor from immediate and long-term reductions in fitness following irradiation.
Researchers have identified a serine protease inhibitor, SmKI-1, in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which plays a crucial role in the parasite's survival and development. The study found that the recombinant Sm-1 and its Kunit domain, but not the C-terminal region, possess inhibitory activity against tryp and neutrophil elastase (NE). Molecular docking studies revealed that Sm-1's Kunit domain blocks NE's active site. Sm-1 also inhibited the capacity of NE to kill schistosomes. To investigate Sm-1's role in the parasite, specific siRNA was used to knockdown Sm-1 in S. mansoni, resulting in a robust impact on parasite development in vitro and in vivo. Sm-1's ability to interfere with neutrophil function was tested in murine models of inflammatory diseases. Treatment with Sm-1 rescued acetaminophen (AP)-mediated liver damage, reducing neutil recruitment and elast activity. In a model of gout, Sm-1 reduced neutil accumulation, IL-β secretion, hyperiception, and pathological score. Sm-1 inhibited early events triggering neutil recruitment in pleural cavities of mice in response to carrageenan. Sm-1 is a key protein in S. mans survival and has the ability to inhibit neutil function as a therapeutic against inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a novel method for accurately modeling transmembrane helical (TM) protein structures from distant homologues with distinct loop and TM conformations. The method was tested on a benchmark of 50 TM protein pairs with diverse topology, size, and sequence identity, and achieved near-atomic prediction accuracy in membrane-embedded regions. The technique was validated in two blind predictions, including the adenosine A2 and chemokine CX4 receptors, and ranked first in the GPCRDOCK prediction contests for receptor accuracy. Unlike starting templates, the models are suitable for computer-based protein engineering and redesigned X-ray structures exhibit similar interactions. The method should be useful for atom-level modeling and design of structurally uncharacterized TM proteins from a range of homologues.
Listeria monocytogen, the causative agent of listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses risks to fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals, has been found to switch from an active, motile lifestyle to a state of persistence in vacuoles in human hepatocytes and trophoblast cells during several days of infection. Upon intracellular spread, bacteria stop producing actin nucleating protein Act and become trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles termed Lister-Containing Vacoles (Lis). Subpopulations of bacteria resist degradation in Lis and enter a slow/non-replicative state. During subculture of host cells harboring Lis, bacteria show capacity to cycle between vacolar and act-based motility stages. Act absent, as in ΔAct mutants, vacolar bacteria parasitize host in "viable but nonculturable" (VB) state, preventing detection by conventional counting methods. Exposure to high gentamicin doses does not trigger Lis formation but selects vacolar VB bacteria. These results reveal L monocogen's ability to enter persistent state in epithelial cells, favoring asymptomatic carriage, lengthening incubation of listiosis, and bacterial survival during therapy.
Researchers developed a neuromechanical model of auditory streaming to study the alternations between integrated and segregated percepts in the A-BA triplet paradigm. The model incorporates neuronal units with sensory-dependent inputs mimicking the A1 responses to tones and includes mutual inhibition, adaptation, and NMDA-like excitation for temporal memory. Percepts are identified in the firing patterns of the units. The model predicts that manipulating the frequency difference between tones A and B affects the dominance of the stronger percept, a property established in visual bistable paradigms. Psychoac experiments confirmed the prediction and constrained the model, achieving quantitative agreement between results. The model provides a platform to consider other conditions, including context and volition. 

The study focuses on the alternations after the build phase, motivated by physiological and perceptual bistability models. The formulation incorporates sound-evoked A1 responses and competition. Percept states are identified in neuronal dynamics, not preassigned to phenomenological units. NMD-like dynamics enables binding from one triplet to the next. Increasing stimulus strength favors the attended percept, but inputs should be dynamic and dependent on perceptual state. Future work will explore attention effects in streaming. Studies report integrated and segregated percepts, but other interpretations have been documented. The neuromechanical formulation and emergence of percepts in tonotopic organization distinguish it from auditory models. Parameters balance adaptation and noise were tuned to percept durations, fitting a log distribution. A responses were interpreted using neuetric functions mimicking build.
Researchers have developed a method to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins using a humanized Ratophil Leukemia (RSAT8) cell line in combination with a cell-free in vitro translation system. This method allows for rapid screening of potential allergens within 90 minutes without the need for purification. Antigen integrity is confirmed using Western blotting. The suitability of this system is demonstrated using characterised parasitic allergens such as Par 2, SmAL-1, and IgE factor SE/alpha-1 expressed in wheat lysate or E. coli. coli. SmAL-1, but not SmAL2, activates the basophil reporter line. This method is suitable for medium to high-throughput studies using infected sera and can be used to study the basis of allergity of helmin proteins. The technology paves the way for genome-wide assessment of S. mans allergenicity, the Schistoma allergome, and could unravel the entire allergome of S. mans and other medically important parasites. This could lead to a better understanding of the basis of allergity and the relationship between parasite IgE and host mechanisms at the molecular level.
Researchers studied the phenomenon of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila, a form of genomic incompatibility that arises when the abundance of transposable elements (TEs) differs between two parents. They found that when TEs inherited from the father are absent in the mother's genome, they can become activated in the progeny, causing germline damage and sterility. Using D. virilis as a model, they characterized the effects of divergence in TE profile between parents on offspring. They showed that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germl TE expression in genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses, and these differences are transmitted to the next generation. Chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. They also demonstrated that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in piRNA profile of parents arising from polymorphic TE insertions. These results support a model where early germl events in dysgenesis establish a chronic state of TE and gene expression in germl maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next.
Researchers have identified a potential therapeutic target for Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXT), a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CG repeat expansion in the FMR1 gene. Overexpression of histone deacetylases (HD) 3, 6, or 11 suppressed neurodegeneration in a Drosila model of FXT by selectively repressing the CG repeat-containing transgene. This suggests that the CG repeat induces alterations in histone acetylation at the F1 locus, leading to increased F1 expression and neurode. In human lymphoblast and fibroblasts from preutation carriers, histones at the F1 locus were found to be acetylated, correlating with elevated F1 expression. Histone acetylase inhibitors reduced F1 expression to control levels in preutation cell lines and extended lifespan in CG repeat-expressing Dila. These findings support a model where the CG repeat promotes chromatin remodeling, increasing toxic F1 expression. Additionally, histone acetylase inhibitors or deacetylase activators may be used to selectively repress the F1 locus.
A study investigated the role of host genetics in controlling CD8 T cell function and immunopathology during chronic viral infection. Effective CD8 T responses are crucial for controlling chronic viral infections, but factors contributing to maintaining effector CD8 cell responses versus CD8 cell exhaustion during chronic infection are unclear. The study examined the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on developing chronic infection using F1 crosses of B10.D2 and B6 (DBF1) and BAL.B x BAL/c (B1) mice infected with lymphocytic choriomitis virus (LCM) clone 13. DBF mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice, while H2BDBF mice on C57 background exhibited mortality. CD8 cell depletion prevented mortality in DBF mice, indicating mortality was CD T-cell dependent. DBF mice maintained CD8 cell effector cytokine production and reduced T exhaustion marker PD-1 expression. Additionally, DB mice induced larger Th1 response than B mice and mortality in DB mice was dependent CD4-mediated IFN production. Results indicate increased M heterogeneity results in CD8 cell frequency during chronic infection. H2DB mice on C57 background succumbed to infection. DB mice mounted higher CD8 response than BALB mice determined by CD11 upregulation and CD8 downregulation. Both immune environment and M diversity contribute CD T-dependent clearance and mortality in DB mice.
This study analyzed the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. Anthrax is a re-emerging zoon disease and endemic in China, particularly in rural areas. The study described the general characteristics of human anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China over the past decade and analyzed the genetic of Bacillus anthracis using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and multilocus-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers. Five subline/subgroups, A. Br.001/002, A. Br. Voll, A. Br94, A. Br Ames, and A. Br.008/009, were detected using 13 SNP sites. All subgroups were found in Xinjiang, while one in Shaanxi, two Gans, three Qinghai, and four in Inner Mongolia. Geographical distribution of B. anthrac populations exhibited different SNP characteristics from strains before 1990 in China. A. Br Ames was observed scattered from Inner to other provinces. All 106 strains assigned 36 MLVA genotypes, 21 first observed in this study. Strains from anthrax recent decade classified subgroups A. Br.001 and A. Br and genotypes MLVA-28, ML-30, ML-31, ML-38, ML-CH3, ML-18. By SNP and MLVA, diversification ML genotypes and geographical B anthrac populations becoming balanced northwestern China. This study provides preliminary results diversity B. anthrac China, promoting prevention and control important disease.
Researchers investigated the role of goblet cells in defending against enteric pathogens, specifically Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, which causes severe diarrheal disease by attaching to the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Studies using Citrobacter rodium, a related pathogen, showed that hosts rely on immune-mediated changes in goblet cells to defend against pathogens, including CD4 T-dependent increase in epithelial cell proliferation and altered mucin production. Goblet-derived mediator, Resist-like Molecule (RELM)-β, is strongly induced in gob cells during infection and detected in stool and serum, but its role unclear. Wild-type and REL-β deficient mice were infected with C. rodium, showing modestly elevated C. rodium burdens, but REL- mice suffered increased mortality and mucosal ulcer due to deep pathogen penetration. Immunostaining revealed REL- mice impaired infection-induced epithelial proliferation. REL- did not directly increase epithelial proliferation, but acted as a CD4 T chemoattract. REL- mice showed impaired CD4 cell recruitment and reduced interleukin-22, a multifunctional cytokine increasing epithelial proliferation. REL delivery to REL- mice restored CD4 cell, increased IL-22 and epithelial, and reduced muc pathology. These findings demonstrate REL- and gob cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4 cells to protect against enteric pathogen, via increased epithelial proliferation.
Researchers have identified a conserved interaction between the C-terminal motif of norovirus VP and the HE-1 domain of eIF4, essential for translation initiation. Norovirus, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, uses an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis, relying on interactions between VP protein attached to the 5' end of the RNA and eukotic factors in the host. For murine norirus (MNV), VP binds to the middle fragment of e4G (residues 652-113). This study used pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to demonstrate a stretch of ~20 amino acids at the C-terminus of MN VP mediates direct and specific binding to HE-1 within 4G of e4. Analysis reveals the MN C-termin binds e4 HE-1 via a motif conserved in all noriruses. Mutagenic mapping suggests the MN VP C-termin interacts e4 in helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy defined the VP binding site on e4 HE-1, confirmed by mutagen and binding assays. The site is non-overlapping with binding for eA on e4 HE-1, showing norirus VP can form ternary VP-e4-eA complexes. Functional significance of VP-e interaction shown by fusion proteins containing C-terminal of MN VP inhibiting in vitro translation of norirus but not cap or I-dependent.
Researchers investigated the evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes, where genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are often found near each other on the chromosome. Several explanations have been proposed, including natural selection favoring clusters for efficiency, the selfish operon model, and persistence model. The selfish operon model suggests clusters are easily transferred to other species, improving survival, while the persistence model proposes genes in proximity are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. A computational models were developed to study conditions for cluster evolution. The selfish model was re-implemented and run under various conditions, then a Moran process with selection and gene rearrangement by inversion was introduced, and a model with selection and inversion was developed. Surprisingly, clusters failed to evolve under many conditions. Factors promoting evolution include low gene number in pathway, high population size, and selfish model, high transfer rate. Analysis showed evolution can occur under direct and indirect selection with certain conditions, making the selfish model a viable explanation for clusters. The oper model was re-examined, unable to explain gene order in biochemical reactions, possibly due to multiple transfer mechanisms. The persistence model explains clustering of essential genes, less likely to be disrupted by deletion. The selfish model proposes evolution without selection, clusters persist due to proximity facilitating transfer between species, applying to accessory genes. A model was constructed with a Moran process and inversion, tracking population of bacterial cells with a pathway of 3 or more genes. The population was initialized with uniformly placed genes on the chromosome. Gene clusters did not evolve under parameters used by Lawrence and Roth. The selfish model was re-examined by varying parameters, revealing the effect on average distance.
Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions worldwide, with pregnant women being particularly vulnerable to severe consequences due to parasite-infected erythrocyte adhesion in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a variant of PfEMP1, a hyper-variable antigen encoded on infected cells, called VARCSA, which binds chondroit sulfate on syncyotrophlasts in the intervillous space of placent. VARCS is only expressed in the presence of placenta, suggesting its expression is repressed in men or non-pregnant women, but the mechanism is not understood. Researchers used cultured lines and gene constructs to show the VARCS gene contains a small open reading frame that represses translation of mRNA, a novel form of regulation in malaria parasites. This repression is reversible, allowing high protein levels upon selection, enabling parasites to upregulate expression in host tissue.

 Studies on VARCS regulation and expression will provide insights into host-parasite interactions underlying disease pathogenesis. The 5 leader of VARCS transcripts from CSA-binding parasites and pregnant women revealed the found upstream Pf1 region is spliced and present in mRNA, indicating VARCS is encoded bicronic transcript. This suggests additional regulation of Pf1 variant with pregnancy malaria, preventing expression when plac is not available. VARCS can be detected in non-pregn individuals, including children and men, suggesting post-transcription repression, lower immune exposure. Contrary, proteomic study detected VARCS parasites non-plental and earlier CSA-binding parasites nonregn hosts. The parasite genome contains 60 genes varying isolates, VARCS conserved in most, if not all, isolates.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide microarray analysis of blood samples from 34 children infected with deng virus (DENV) in Nicaragua, collected on days 3-6 of illness, to investigate the transcription profiles of peripheral immune cells. The study identified genes differentially regulated between clinical subgroups, with striking differences observed between deng patients with and without shock, particularly in expression of mitochondrial proteins associated with protein synthesis. In deng hemorrhagic fever, a subset of differentially expressed genes encoded neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides with innate immunity. A meta-analysis with published datasets confirmed DENV infection is associated with changes in protein and nucleic metabolism, whereas in vitro leads to increased interferon signature, not observed in vivo samples, suggesting transient interferon response by day 3-6 of illness. The study highlights differences between manifestations of DENV severity and identifies commonalities. A common response to D infection, regardless of outcome, was observed in 310 genes upregulated during acute relative convalescence. IRF and BL expression supported B cell stimulation and proliferation in acute D infection, possibly amplified in severe manifestations. A distinct profile was found between Nicaraguan deng patients with shock and DH, and muted between DF and DH. Microarray meta-analysis with existing datasets identified common and differences. Comparing severe and non-severe DENV cases, 32 genes were significantly different, with 25 more expressed in severe and 7 in non-severe.
Herpesviruses, such as Murid Herpesvirus-4 (Mu-4), a lymphotropic herpesvirus related to Kaposi's Sarcoma Herpesvirus, target the olfactory epithelium for entry. Mu-4 binds to heparan sulfate (HS) and virions unable to bind HS show poor entry. The olfactory epithelium, composed of neurons, sustacular cells, and precursor cells, expresses HS on its apical cilia and binds incoming virions. Virions track down neuronal cilia, infecting neurons or reaching microvilli of sustacular cells and infecting them. The olfactory epithelium provides an important site for HS-dependent herpesvirus uptake. Mu-4 exploits neurons for entry despite being non-neurotropic, suggesting the epithelium as an entry portal for herpesviruses. HS is considered non-specific prior to protein binding but also key for Mu-4 entry. Neuroepithelial-targeted HS interventions may control herpesvirus infection. HS availability restricts Mu-4 entry to olfactory epithelium as gp150 mutants infect less than wild-type despite less HS-dependence. The relationship between HS expression, virion binding, and infection was established using Mu-4 as a tractable model.
A new regulatory circuit involving CRP-c, a metabolic regulator, has been identified that silences SPI-1 genes in Salmonella under non-permissive conditions. CRP-deficient strains show a strong upregulation of SPI-1 genes in the mid-logarithmic phase. Genetic analysis reveals CRP modulates the level of Hil, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at the post-transcription level through a newly identified motif in the 3'UTR of Hil. Spot42, an Hfq-dependent sRNA, is under transcriptionally repressed by CR-c and targets the 3'UT of Hil, exerting a positive effect on Hil expression. In vivo and in vitro assays indicate Spot42 targets the unstructured region of Hil 3'UT. The results highlight the 3'UT of Hil as a hub for postcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression. CR-c indirectly regulates virulence by affecting postcriptional regulation of Hil. CR-deficient strains are unable to secrete SPI-1 TSS effector proteins and are avirulent in a mouse model. The mechanism of CR-c mediated SPI-1 repression in exponentially growing Salmon reveals novel sRNAs target mRNAs. Data point to postcription stimulation of Hil mRNA by Spot42. CR-c regulates rapid responses to environmental changes and may be relevant for Hil-mediated virulence response to environmental conditions Salmon encounters during infection.
Researchers investigated the relationship between CAG repeat instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the Huntington's disease (HD) locus in R6 and R2 transgenic mouse lines, which express a similar transgene integrated at different sites and recapitulate tissue-specific instability. They found that instability rates were higher in R2 tissues compared to R1 samples, correlating with high transgene expression and chromatin accessibility. Transgene mRNA and H3K trimylation at the HD locus were increased, while H3 dimylation was reduced in R2 tissues. However, levels of transgene expression and histone marks were similar in striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing different CAG levels. Elongating RNA II at the locus, but not initiating Pol II, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG levels. H3 trimylation, a mark with transcription, was increased at HD in striatum not cerebellum. Results suggest transcription modulates somatic CAG in vivo, with elongation regulated in a tissue-dependent manner contributing to tissue-selective instability. The transgene was integrated in a euchromatin and transcriptionally active region in R2 mice than R1, supporting active chrom structure in increased C instability. C instability was higher in R2, irrespective repeat size, than R1, suggesting chrom context and expression, not initial size, underlies different somatic levels. Despite similar HD expression, striatum and cerebellum presented different C levels. Histone modifications associated with heterochrom, euchrom, and initiation at HD were comparable in striatum and cerebell. Accessibility to repair factors when chrom is open was tested, but chrom accessibility unlikely underlies tissue-selective somatic instability.
Researchers investigated the genomic features of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a highly virulent enterovirus, to understand its ability to disseminate in humans. They analyzed five full-length genomes from immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease at different sites: respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, and blood. Three nucleotide changes occurred within a five days: a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 within the BC loop (97), a region considered immunogenic and important in poliovirus adaptation; a conservative amino substitution in protein 2 (38); and a silent mutation in protein 3 (175). Infectious clones were constructed with Br (A) and clinical (C) lineages containing one or both non-syn mutations. In vitro tropism and competition assays revealed the VP1 Leu to Arg substitution within BC conferred replicative advantage in SH-SY5 neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was associated with a nonervative substitution (167 or 167) in VP EF loop in neuroblast cells. Comparative models of EV71 VP variants showed no structural changes, but substitutions may alter host interactions. Results indicate the VP BC region of EV plays a role in tropism independent of lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotropism in immunocompromised patients.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of quorum sensing in Streptoccus species, a genus of bacteria that includes both pathogenic and commensal species. They focused on the ComRS system, a quorum sensing pathway that regulates competence, the ability of bacteria to take up extracellular DNA. This process allows for rapid acquisition of new traits, such as antibiotic resistance in pathogenic microorganisms. ComRS consists of a peptide pherone (ComS) that is processed, secreted, and imported into the cytoplasm, where it binds the transcription factor ComR. Com then activates a positive feedback loop for expression of Com and the sigma-factor SigX. Although ComRS is present in most Streptoccus species, the sequences of Com and Com diverge significantly, suggesting a mechanism for species-specific communication. To study cross-talk between Streptoc species in regulation of competence, researchers developed an in vivo assay to measure Com activity in response to cognate and heterologous peptides. They found distinct classes of strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. A crystal structure of Com from S suis was solved to understand interaction with Com and search for structural features that explain recognition. Directed mutagenesis probed the conformation of the binding site, revealing a variable and conserved face, where conserved residues contribute to ligand binding and variable discriminate among peptides. Results provide a model for recognition specificity and allow prediction of novel peptides that induce Com activity.
Researchers studied the replication of centrom DNA in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, a model organism with epigenetically inherited centromes. They found that each centere is associated with a replication origin that fires first on its respective chromosome, and epigen formation of new centes (neocentres) is accompanied by shifts in replication timing, becoming the first to replicate and associated with origin complex (ORC) components. Changing the level of centere-specific histone H isoform led to concomitant changes in OR association with centere regions, supporting the idea that centere proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centere-associated DNA revealed a replication sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active origins. This pattern is conserved with centere position among strains and species, independent of primary sequence. The study suggests that inheritance of centere position is correlated with constitutively active replication that fires at distinct time.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of chronic back pain (CB) in 158,025 adults of European ancestry from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biob data release. CB cases were defined as those reporting back pain for ≥3-6 months, non-cases as controls. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs10519 in SOX5 (OR 1.08, p=7.2×10-10). This was replicated in 283,752 UKob participants not in the discovery, including 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p=5.3×10-11) and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint-analysis (OR 1.07, p.4.5×10-19). Suggestive associations were found at three loci in the discovery, two of which exceeded genome-wide in joint-analysis: intergenic rs317, between CC26 and GSD (OR 1.05, p4.4×10-13) and intronic rs438 in D (0.97 p2.4×10). This is the first meta-analysis GWAS for CB, identifying a genetic locus associated with CB (SO5). Two other loci reached genome-wide significance in 2-stage joint-analysis (CC/GSD and D).
A study was conducted to estimate the burden of Taenia solium cysticosis in Cameroon, a neglected zoonotic disease affecting humans and pigs in developing countries. The prevalence of neurocystercosis, a symptom of the disease, was estimated at 3.6%, with 50,326 people affected, representing 1% of the population, and 15,961 pigs diagnosed with cysticosis, 5.6% of the pig population. The total annual cost of T. solium cystosis in Cameroon was estimated at €10,255,202, with 4.7% due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses from human cystosis. The monetary burden per case was €194. The number of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALs) lost was 9.0 per 1,000 per year. The study used country-specific parameters, including human and animal burden of the zoon disease, and compared with a study in South Africa, indicating cost inactivity influenced the monetary burden. Knowing salary and prevalence allows rapid indication of total cost. The estimated DALs lost were higher than other neglected diseases.
Researchers have identified a non-coding RNA called Rsa in Staphylococcus aureus that plays a crucial role in regulating the bacterium's virulence. Rsa is a small RNA that is present in all Staphlococcus species and has a C-rich sequence, suggesting it regulates mRNA at the post-transcription level. The study found that Rsa represses the synthesis of the transcriptional regulator Mgr by forming a duplex with the Shine-Dalg sequence and loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA. This recognition is necessary for translation repression. As a result, Rsa enhances biofilm formation and decreases capsule synthesis in several strains, leading to decreased protection against opsonophoc killing by polymonuclear leukocytes. In animal models, Rsa attenuates the severity of acute infections and enhances catheter colonization. Rsa is part of a regulatory network that contributes to S aureus interactions with the immune system, moderating invasiveness and chronic infections. This is the first example of a conserved RNA in S aure functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections.
Researchers have developed a novel method to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a critical step in the virus's entry into host cells, using a fluorescently tagged form of the capsid-binding protein cyclophilin A (Cyp-DRed). This protein is specifically packaged into virions through high-affinity binding to the capsid (CA) and remains associated with cores after membrane permeabilization and removal. The rate of loss is modulated by core stability and accelerated upon initiation of reverse transcription. Single particle tracking reveals that most cores lose Cyp-DRed shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. The assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 unating in living cells, revealing previously unapprecited spatio-temporal features of this incompletely understood process. Unating occurs in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. The Cyp-DRed probe efficiently incorporates into HIV-1 particles without compromising infectivity and reports loss of CA during unating, supported by correlation with HIV-1 caps stability and p24 loss from labeled cores in vitro. The Cyp-based assay visualizes native HIV-1 cores without additional manipulations, unlike other in vitro unating assays.
Researchers investigated oligonucleotide usage in archaeal and bacterial genomes, examining its relationship with codon usage, DNA base stacking, and DNA structure. They analyzed oligonucle frequencies in coding and non-coding regions, and found that prokotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucle frequencies, indicating prootic DNA is short-range correlated. Oligonucle usage varied more in AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC-rich freeiving genomes, mainly in nonoding regions. Bias in tetranucle usage correlated with GC content, with coding regions more biased than nonoding. Nonoding regions were 5.5% more AT-rich than coding, on average, in 402 examined chromosomes. Pronounced compositional differences were found within and between AT-rich and GC genomes. GC genomes were similar in tetranucle usage nonoding than AT genomes. Differences may be attributed to lifestyle, as tetran usage host-associated was more dissimilar and less biased than freeiving.
Researchers have investigated the factors that influence meiotic recombination, a process that ensures correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity. They analyzed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm at six active hotspots and found a novel form of biased transmission exclusive to non-crossover recombinants, arising from differences in crossover and non-crossover heterodup formation and mismatch repair. This form of biased conversion does not influence hotspot activity, but constitutes a previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive, potentially affecting thousands of hotspots throughout the human genome. At two hotspots, this drive favors G/C over A base pairs, consistent with established correlations between GC content and recombination in mammalian genomes. Heterozygosity at a SNP can influence hotspot activity in cis, and biased conversions have been observed in some assays, arising from initiation on one chromosome and correction from the other. This form of meiotic drive is strong enough to promote allele fixation, and may contribute to the correlation between GC content and recombination and evolution of genomic composition.
Researchers have developed a computational model to identify potential health risks associated with exposure to environmental chemicals and drugs by integrating toxicogenomics data, chemical structures, protein-protein interactions, and disease information. The model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, predicting which may be risk factors for human health. The network can also identify unexpected associations between chemicals and proteins. Examples include chemicals associated with breast cancer, lung cancer, necrosis, and potential targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloribenzo-dioxin, pirix acid, and permethrin. Associations are supported by published studies, illustrating the power of integrating toxicogenomics with other data.

The model predicts high-level associations between chemical exposures and diseases and detailed associations between chemicals and proteins. It integrates toxicogen data, chemical structures, protein-protein interactions, and disease information. The approach differs from existing computational biology, primarily integrating drug information to identify molecular targets and link to diseases. Toxicogen data from the Comparative Toxicogen Database (CTD) was used, containing 42,194 associations between 2,490 compounds and 6,060 targets involved in human diseases. To predict health risks, clusters were analyzed to identify chemical-disease associations. Disease-chemical associations have no direction, separating positive from negative.
Researchers have developed a new approach to understanding how the auditory cortex processes sound by fitting a nonlinear feedforward network model, called a receptive field, to neural responses to natural sounds. This model reveals that primary auditory neurons are sensitive to a larger spectrotemporal domain than previously thought, and that their responses result from complex interactions between multiple subfields. The receptive field is a parsimonious network of 1-7 subfields that interact nonlinearly, outperforming standard receptive fields in predicting neural responses to auditory stimuli. It shows separate excitatory and inhibitory subfields with distinct properties, and their interaction gives rise to operations such as gain and conjunctive detection. Conjunct effects, where neurons respond to specific features together, increase selectivity for complex spectrotemp structures and may be important in sound recognition. This approach expands on simple receptive models, yielding improved predictive power and revealing nonlinear aspects of processing in an interpretable form.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for casein kinase 2 (CK)-mediated phosphorylation of the BMAL1 protein in regulating the mammalian circadian clock. Using a novel peptide, they found that CK2 phosphorylates BM1 at serine 90 (BM1-S90) in central and peripheral clocks. Further analysis revealed a novel function of the RY protein as a repressor of CK2 kinase activity towards BM1. Co-immunoprecipitation and real-time protein-protein interaction experiments showed that RY-mediated binding of CK2 to BM1 inhibits BM1-S90 phosphorylation by CKα. The FAD domain of R1, C-terminal BM1 domains, and BM1 lysine 537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT are critical for RY-mediated BM1-CK2 binding. Conversely, BM1-S90 phosphorylation is necessary for BM1 lysine 537 acetylation. A dual negative feedback model proposes that RY-dependent CK-driven post-translational BM1-P loop is integral to the core oscillator. BM1-BM loop forms a distinct interlocked step in the clock machinery and has integral roles in the circadian through R-mediated negative suppression. R proteins have a dual function, repressing BM1-CLOCK transcription and repressing CK2 activity towards BM1. In RY-deficient mice, BM1 is hyperphosphorylated, suggesting R involvement in rhythmic BM modification. This study investigated the universal and oscillatory mechanism of circadian CK-mediated BM1 phosphorylation, uncovering a novel R role as repressor of phosphorylation. A model illustrates the mechanism of CK-mediated postlational loop and its role in intracellular circadian core oscillator.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapts to survive in the presence of bile, which has antibacterial properties due to its ability to disrupt membranes, denature proteins, and damage DNA. They found that sublethal concentrations of the bile salt sodium deoxycholate (DOC) can adapt Salmonella to survive lethal concentrations of bile. This adaptation is associated with changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses. The role of the stress response in adaptation to bile is supported by the observation that Rpo mutants are bile-sensitive. Adaptation also involves a response by the bacterial population, but individual cells can become bile-resistant without adaptation. Plating a non-adapted Salmonella culture on medium containing lethal bile yields resistant colonies at frequencies of 10^-6 to 10^-7 per cell generation. Fluctuation analysis indicates these colonies derive from bile-resistant cells present in the culture. A fraction of isolates are stable, indicating resistance can be acquired by mutation. Genome sequencing of resistant mutants shows alteration of lipopolysaccharide transport is a cause of mutational resistance. However, selection on lethal bile also provides isolates not mutants. They propose these derive from cells in a physiological state permitting survival upon bile. This is supported by single cell analysis of gene expression using microscopeic system: Salmonella cultures contain stress genes in absence DOC.
The E. coli chromosome is organized into 400-500 supercoiled domains through both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. Prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by its termini L and R, which are 37bp apart on the genome. The formation and maintenance of the Mu domain is dependent on a strong gyrase site (SGS) at the center of Mu, Mu end MuB protein, and E. coli proteins IH, F, and H. The domain was observed at two chromosomal locations. In contrast, prophage does not form an independent domain. The establishment and maintenance of Mu domain is promoted by low-level transcription from phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent. The domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by topological requirements of reaction and proximity of ends. The benefits to host from a subset proteins expressed by proph may help its long-term stability.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed antimalarial that prevents Plasium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears mature Plasium falciparum (Pf) gamocytes, reducing postreatment transmission. A randomized treatment-to-reinfection study in Papua New Guine children investigated Pv and Pf gamocyte carriage after cure. Children received radical cure with chloroquine, artemether-lumeftrine plus Q or placebo. Blood samples were collected 2-4 weekly over 8 months. Gamocytes were detected by reverse transcription PCR targeting p25 and p25. Q reduced Pv gamocyte incidence by 73%, comparable to Q effect on blood-stage infections. 92% Pv and 79% Pf gamocyte infections were asymptomatic. Pv gamocyte positivity and density were associated with high-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis showed reduced gamocytes in mixed-species compared to single-species for both Pv and Pf (OR 0.39 [0.25-0.62], Pf 0.33 [0.18-0.60], p<0.001). No difference between Q and placebo arms was observed in Pv gamocyte density or Pv infections carrying gamocytes. First-stage and placebo infections were likely caused by relapse hypnoite, equally carried gamocytes than first Q infections by infective bite. Pvapses and new infections had similar gamocytemia levels. Relapses contribute to Pv reservoir, highlighting anti-hypite treatment for control.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze the GTP cycling of Rho family Gases, which play a crucial role in various cellular processes such as migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. The study focused on the primary members of this family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, which have different effects on actin remodeling, but share a common mechanism of targeting the plasma membrane and activation through GTP binding. The researchers hypothesized that GTP cycling between the membrane and cytosol is key to the differential regulation of these biochemical switches. They analyzed experimental data using a modeling framework to reveal details of GDI cycling and distinguish between G-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and association/dissociation of Gase with membrane. The analysis of Rac cycling revealed a lower affinity of G for RacG compared to RacDP, explained by faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. Non-steady-state solutions for membrane of Gase were presented in multidimensional charts. This methodology was applied to glucose-stimulated cycling in pancreatic β-cells, illustrating effects of Gs/Gs and affinities between Gases and membrane/G on bound G. The charts can be used to assess how modifications may compensate for Gase-G balance in disease scenarios. The study demonstrates R-G cycling can access diverse pathways in different systems through experimental manipulations.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs for schistosomiasis collect data to assess the impact of interventions and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) goals of morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem. Prevalence and intensity of infection are typically collected from school-aged children (SAC) as they are easy to sample and likely to be infected by schosome parasites. However, adults are also likely to be infected. This study investigates how the age distribution of infection impacts mathematical model recommendations for preventive chemotherapy levels to achieve WHO goals. For moderate prevalence regions, treating only SAC may achieve WHO goals, but for high prevalence with high infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet goals. The optimal strategy for a region requires consideration of burden in adults, not solely based on SAC prevalence. Past epidemiological data informed models for transmission control, but accurate data from M&E are needed to determine optimal strategy. Collecting prevalence and intensity from a broader age range, including adults at baseline and throughout treatment, rather than SAC, is crucial to determine strategy. Additional data, such as individual adherence, should be collected in M&E. Including adults in treatment efforts, a proportion of Schos infection will remain untreated, creating a reservoir. In 2002, adults in high-risk areas and women of childbearing age were recommended to be treated. Mathematical models recommended adaptations, such as increased coverage or frequency. Burden in adults varies geographically, impacted by local and WASH factors. Infection profile and burden in adults varies for schosome in countries and communities. This study explores how age profiles with low to high burdens in adults impact model recommendations for treatment levels to achieve WHO. The importance of collecting age-specific data, including adults in M&E is highlighted. SAC are likely to be infected due to age-related contact and absence of immunity, treatment has focused on this group to prevent morbidity.
Researchers developed a computational model to predict surgery outcomes in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients using structural connectivity data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 61 individuals with TLE and 39 healthy controls. The model simulated seizure onset and location in patients differed from controls, with patients transitioning from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical areas, were frequent starting points for seizures in patients. Contralateral frontal regions may play a role in seizure spreading or resistance. The model predicted patient-specific surgery resections led to better outcomes than standard procedures. This work provides a step towards individualized modeling of epilepsy to inform treatment strategies. 

The brain was modeled as a network with regions abstracted to nodes and connections mapped through DTI. Seizure initiation and spreading were modeled using connectivity specific to patients. This is based on previous studies simulating epilepsy with human connectome data using atlases. Weighting of edges was another factor to consider. Validation examined initial nodes in the brain. In TLE, seizure origin in the left temporal lobe was expected to match clinical observations. Top escaping nodes were found in patient and control populations, with locations in both. 

The model was used to perform in silico resections, removing nodes from networks and comparing seizure likelihood post-surgery to pre-surgery. Results showed that patient-specific resections led to greater seizure reduction than standard procedures. This suggests that individualized surgery may improve outcomes.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses various strategies to counteract the host's innate antiviral defenses, including interference with interferon and apoptotic signaling. The virus encodes four interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), which function in a dominant negative manner to block cellular IR activities and target IR-induced proteins such as p53 and TGF-β-activated Smad transcription factors. This study identifies the direct targeting of vIR-1 to Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, to its inactivation via nuclear translocation. vIR-1-mediated localization of Bim was detected in infected cells by immunofluorescence and western analysis of fractionated extracts. Co-localization of v-1 and B was also detected in nuclei of lytically infected endothelial cells. Co-precipitation assays revealed a direct interaction between v-1 and B, with B-binding residues of mapped by deletion and mutagenesis. Generation of B-refactory v-1 variants showed the importance of v-1:B interaction, specifically in prolication and anti-apopt activity of v-1. Blocking the interaction with a cell-perable peptide confirmed the relevance v-1:B association to v- prolication. This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with a B-2 family member and sequestration of B or any member as a means of inactivation. The data reveal a novel mechanism used by virus to control replication-induced apoptosis and suggest inhibitory of v-1:B interaction may provide an antiral strategy.
Epithelial Integrin Regulates the Amplitude of Protective Lung Interfer Responses against Respiratory Pathogens

The study investigates the role of epithelial αV6 integrin in regulating the lung's immune response to injury and infection. α6 is upregulated during injury and modulates acute lung injury (ALI) through undefined mechanisms. Researchers found that upregulation of α6 during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. Mice lacking α6 (β KO) have increased survival during infection due to limited viral spread into alveolar spaces, leading to reduced ALI. Although β KO mice have normal lungs, they harbor constitutively activated CD11+ alolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type I interferon (IF) signaling, attributed to loss of α-activated growth factor (TGFβ). Administration of exogenous TGF to β KO mice reduces CD11+ AM, type IF activity, and protective phenotype during infection. Protection extends to other respiratory pathogens, such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. The study demonstrates that loss of epithelial protein α6 integrin alters lung microenvironment during homeostasis and infection, leading to reduced injury and improved survival.
Researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of 733 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis at a reference center in Argentina from 2006-2015 to assess the usefulness of the Leishman Skin Test (LST) as a diagnostic tool. Leishmania (Viann) brazili is the most common cause of cutaneous and mucosal leishiasis in the Americas, with low parasite burden in lesions, making diagnosis challenging. The study included 93% cutaneous, 7% mucosal, and <1% disseminated cases. Diagnosis was confirmed in 65% through skin or mucosal smears, with 6 cases negative LST. Among 190 smear-negative cases, 190 were also LST-negative, but 69 LST-positive. Sensitivity ratios between smear and L were similar across age groups. Lesions >21 days-old correlated with positive results for both smear and L. The study supports LST as a diagnostic complement for cutaneous leishias across age groups in endemic areas, with high correlation with smear. Standardization and further research into protocols will aid management of suspicious cases.
A genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 loci associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, but the mechanisms underlying most of these loci are unknown. Recent studies suggest that many GW variants influence disease through altered transcriptional regulation in disease-relevant cell types. This study explored transcriptional regulation during a key CAD pathophysiological event, the lipid-induced transformation of macrophages to lipid-foam cells. A combination of chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FA-seq) and enhancer transcription mapping chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) in primary macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic low-density lipoprotein (LD) with foam formation showed LD-induced changes in a subset open chromatin and enhancer sites correlated with expression nearby genes. LD-regulated enhancers were enriched for transcription factors, including CEB-beta, previously uninvolved in foam formation. LD exposure upregulated CEB expression and genomic binding, most around genes in inflammatory pathways. Variants at CAD loci were significantly enriched in subset chrom sites altered by LD, including rs643 in LD-enhancer at PP2 locus. LD increased CEB binding to site and CEB activity with protective allele rs643. Expression PP2 product L3 was present in foam human atherosclerotic plaques and LD upregulated L3 in macrophages, increasing pro-inflammatory mediators. This study demonstrates a mechanism contributing CAD at PP2 locus and highlights epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic stimuli.
In Malawi, a country aiming to eliminate trach by 2020, conducted a study to assess the effectiveness of one round of azithrom mass drug administration (MDA) in districts with trach prevalence of 5.0-9% in 1-9 year olds. Eight districts with baseline prevalences 5.0-9% received one round of azithycin MDA, achieving 80% coverage. Population-based trach surveys were conducted in 18 units of these districts 6 months post-MDA, using standardized methodologies conforming to World Health Organization recommendations. Results showed all 18 units had tr prevalence <5.0%. This study demonstrates one round azith MDA with 80% coverage can reduce tr prevalence to <5% in Malawi districts with 5.0-9%. The Malawi Ministry of Health applied to the International Trach Initiative for a donation of one round azithycin M across each district, targeting 3,632,175 people. Dividing districts into subistricts and re-estimating prevalence would be costly and time-consuming. The study suggests one well-conducted, high-coverage MDA may be sufficient to eliminate trach in hypoendemic districts. Without a control group, it's uncertain if observed reductions were due to MDA or secular trend. This study provides optimism for Malawi to eliminate trach as a public health problem by 2020.
Arabidopsis NLR immune signaling is mediated by Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPs), which play a crucial role in bifurcating immune responses initiated by NLR proteins. Activation of NLR proteins, such as RPS and RPM, by pathogen effectors triggers immune responses, including programmed cell death (PCD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and transcriptional reprogramming. Functional and biochemical screens identified six closely related Arabidopsis CPs, CP1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 11, which mediate bifur immune responses activated by NLR. The dynamics of CP1/2 activation by pathogen effect controls the onset of cell death, while sustained CP4/5/6/11 activation phosphorylates specific WRKY transcription factors, WRKY28/48, to regulate transcriptional reprogramming for N-dependent pathogen restriction. Additionally, CP1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma-resident NAD oxidases for ROS production. This study delineates bifurcation of complex mechanisms downstream NLR immune mediated by CPs with distinct specificity and subcell dynamics.
A study was conducted in the district of Nion, Mali to forecast the incidence of Schistosoma haematium, a parasitic disease prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa. The researchers used general exponential smoothing methods within a state-space framework to generate contemporaneous forecasts, accounting for seasonal and interannual fluctuations. The results showed a mean absolute error of 25% for 1-5 month forecasts. The state-space framework accurately captured non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and exogenous factors such as climate, irrigation, and public health interventions. This method could aid in managing and assessing S. haobium transmission and intervention in the district, and potentially in the Sahel region. Schistosoma haium imposes a significant burden on public health in developing countries, with less than 0.5% of investigations attempting to predict its spatial and temporal distributions. Parsimonious forecasting and early warning systems could enhance management and mitigation of parasitic infections.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has evolved a mechanism to restrict its own replication by the tegument protein pp150, which binds to cyclin A and prevents viral gene expression in the S2 cell cycle phase of fully permissive cells. A cyclin-binding deficient pp150 mutant virus was used to investigate the physiological relevance of this restriction during productive CM infection. Unrestricted viral expression in S2 led to G2 arrest, but not mitotic cells supported viral replication. Cyclin destabilization by viral product p21 was required to maintain virus-permissive G2 arrest. A double mutant where pp and p21 are disabled in cyclin interaction forced mitotic entry of infected cells with severe impact on viability and virus growth. pp and p21 function cooperatively target cell cycle synchronization and cyclin avoidance essential for productive CM infection. A double mutant of both p21 and pp motifs was constructed and compared to effects on cell cycle and virus replication with single mutants and CM-WT. Cell cycle-independent CM-pp-R mutant was used to investigate consequences of viral expression in S2, ensuring late functions of pp not hampered by cycl deficiency. Restriction of gene in S phase has function in replication of CM, not merely by-product of silencing quies infection. Mechanism restricts onset of replication to G phase where cyclin expression is low or absent. S cells, though abrogate only delay as pp-repression relieved once lose cycl protein after division. Restriction to cyclin-negative cells important delay virus expression and replication in proliferating cells.
Researchers conducted a targeted sequencing study on 242 sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) cases and 129 controls to identify genetic variants associated with the disease. They analyzed 169 known ALS candidate genes and found a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases compared to controls, indicating potential disease-linked mutations. The study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing combined with functional and rare variant analysis to understand sporadic disease etiology. A candidate gene approach was used to discover mutations in biologically relevant ALS genes in sporadic cases, and bioinformatics tools assessed variant pathogenicity and combined with rare variant binning to demonstrate cases had a higher burden of deleterious mutations than controls. This suggests novel or rare mutations in a set of genes may contribute to sporadic ALS. Next-generation sequencing has revolutionized disease study, but distinguishing disease-causing variants from benign requires rigorous approaches. Familial ALS is more homogeneous than sporadic, with 20 known genes explaining 60% of cases. The study found rare or novel variants in 144 of 242 sequenced patients, suggesting at least 40% of cases have no identifiable genetic cause. New variants were identified in known ALS genes and associated genes, with no association found between previously identified SNPs and ALS in the population, except APO, and new genes identified through trio and RRM studies.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of immune cell memory to influenza virus. They found that IL-6 is crucial for the development of CD4+ T cell memory, but not CD8 T cell memory. IL-6 suppresses the activity of CD4CD+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are a type of immune cell that can downregulate the immune response. In the absence of IL-6, these Tregs are more active and suppress the activity of virus-specific CD4 T cells, leading to impaired memory response. The study used mice deficient in IL-6 (IL-/-) and compared to wild-type mice infected with influenza virus. Results showed that IL-/- mice had impaired CD4 T memory, but not CD8 memory. The effect of IL- on CD4 and CD8 cells is not due to difference in IL- signaling, but rather IL's ability to suppress Tregs. Tregs from IL/- mice suppressed virus-specific CD4 cells, while those from wild-type mice did not. This supports IL's inhibitory effect on Tregs. IL- has been shown to promote survival of CD4 cells, but no increased death was found in IL/- mice. The study suggests IL's major target is Tregs, not CD4 cells, as CD8 response is unimpaired in IL/- mice.
Researchers have identified a new function of the enzyme enolase in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenpyruate. Enase was found to have both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in the parasite and acts as an inhibitor of the cytosine-5 methyltransferase Dmt2. This inhibitory activity was antagonized by 2-phosphoglycer, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls the nonlytic function of enase. Glucose starvation drives enase to accumulate in the nucleus, leading to the formation of an enase-E histtica DNMT homolog Eeth complex and reduction of tRNA methylation in the parasite. The role of enase as Dmt inhibitor was also demonstrated in E histolytica expressing a nuclear localization signal used-enase. These results establish enase as the first Dmt interacting protein and highlight an unexpected role of glyytic enzyme in modulation of Dmt activity. Enase is the first known Dmt-interacting protein and its interaction is conserved outside the Enteba genus, as shown by binding of Drosila and human Dmt proteins to GST-enase.
Researchers have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes, specifically in the species Aedes aegypti and Ae albopictus, for the first time. miRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are generally found inside cells. However, circulating miRN have been found in human serum and saliva, but not previously in hematophagous arthropod saliva. The study used next-generation sequencing to identify 103 miRN in mosquito saliva, 31 of which were new and designated as novel. Several miRN were only expressed in Chikunya virus (CHV) infected mosquitoes. Five miRN were tested for their role in CHV infection, and results showed they are involved in transmission and establishment during feeding on the host. Inhibiting mi decreased viral replication, suggesting mi presence and upregulation enhance CHV replication and dissemination. This is the first report of exogenous mosquito saliva miRN.
Researchers from the RAD52 group have made significant contributions to the understanding of mitochondrial homologous recombination and double-strand break repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mitochondria contain their own genome, which encodes proteins necessary for cellular respiration. Deletions in the genome have been linked to inherited diseases and cancers. Most deletions in human cells are flanked by repetitive sequences, suggesting they result from recombination events. The study investigated the role of double-strand break (DS) repair proteins Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 in mitochondrial DNA repair. Results show that Rad51 and Rad59 are localized to the mitochondrial matrix and Rad51 binds directly to DNA. A mitochondally-targeted restriction endonuclease (mt-KI) was used to create a double-strand break in the genome, allowing analysis of repair in vivo. Loss of these proteins decreased the rate of spontaneous deletions and Rad51 and Rad59 impaired repair of induced DNA breaks. This is the first study to demonstrate Rad51,52, and59 impact mtDNA repair. The study improved a system to introduce a single break per genome to identify proteins in repair. Mitochondrial base excision has been studied, indicating conserved pathways exist. Evidence for homolog recombination (HR) repair in mitochond of different species, including yeast, Dros, and mice. This study shown HR proteins Rad51 and59 localize to mitochondrial matrix. Identification of factors interacting with Rad51,52,59 will elucidate mitochondrial pathways.
A systematic review examined the role of social determinants of health in the risk and prevention of Group A streptoccal infection, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) poses a significant burden among disadvantaged populations, resulting from acute rheumatic (AR) fever, a complication of Group A streptoc (GAS) infection. The review aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health, GAS, AR, and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these. Observational and experimental studies measuring crowding, characteristics, education, employment, income, nutrition, or socioeconomic status and relationship with GAS, AR, RHD were included. 1,164 publications were identified, 90 met criteria, comprising 91 studies, 49.5% were poor quality. The proportion of studies reporting associations between socioeconomic determinants and risk of GAS was 57.1%, AR/RHD 50%. Crowding was most assessed (14 studies GAS, 36 AR/RHD) followed by socioeconomic (6, 36). Most studies assessing crow, characteristics, education, employment, parents, nutrition reported positive association with GAS, AR/RHD risk. Crow, socioeconomic met criteria for causation. Heterogeneity across studies. The literature lacks quality, most were observational, not interventional. Crow a practical target for prevention.
Researchers studied the Pho/PhP bacterial signaling network, a well-stud two-component system, and found that a single mutation in the histidine kinase PhQ results in a striking change in the circuit's properties. The mutation abolishes the phosphatase activity of PhQ, leading to a bistable response to stimulus, whereas the wild-type has a graded response. Mutant cells exhibit different morphologies in on and off states, and the state is inherited over generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the on state. Mathematical modeling suggests bistability depends on autoregulation of PhP and PhQ. The mutant has a lower fitness in stationary cultures in rich medium, but due to inheritance, a population can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. The study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component architecture and highlights tradeoffs in the Ph/Ph system.
Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri, with a high mortality rate and lack of established treatment options. Due to the lack of economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-AM drugs, treatment relies on drug repurposing, applying known drugs for rare diseases. N. fleri requires ergosterol, a building block of plasma membranes, similar to fungi. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated strategy against fungal and agricultural pathogens. N. fleri encodes ster 14-demethylase CYP51, sharing 35% sequence identity with fungal orthologs, raising the possibility of repurposing antifungal drugs for AM. This study assessed the impact of antifungal azoles on sterol biosynthesis and viability of N. fleri trophotes, identified endogenous C51 by mass spectrometry, and interactions between recombinant C51 and azoles. Data validated C51 as a druggable target in N. fleri and azoles as candidates for AM treatment. Fluconazole and miconazole have been used in combination with other drugs in human AM patients. De novo ster biosynthesis occurs in most eukaryotes, including human pathogens like fungi and freeiving amoae. Similarity raises the possibility of repur antifungal drugs and az-based AM therapy. Fluazole depletes ergol by blocking C14 of biosynthetic catalyzed by C51. Fluazole belongs to conazole pedigree targeting C51. This class includes micon, ketoazole vorazole itraazole with amoic effect against N fleri in vitro.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α) in maintaining type 2 immune responses and protective immunity against nematode infections. Nematodes trigger a protective type 2 immune response via IL-4α, but its role in maintaining type 2 responses after polarization was unknown. Using a mouse model where IL-4α gene deletion can be temporally controlled, the study found sustained IL-4α expression is required for maintaining type 2 responses and protective immunity following Nippostrongus brasiliensis infection. Temporal deletion of IL-4α prior to secondary infection with N. brasiliensis showed signaling via this receptor drives efficient recall of type 2 responses and clearance of parasites. This study demonstrates sustained IL-4α mediated signaling is required for maintenance of anti-nemat type 2 responses, a novel function distinct from its role in polarization.
A global analysis of the distribution of Bartonella bacteria in mammals reveals that the pathogen likely originated as an environmental bacterium and commensal before infecting mammals, with rodents and domestic animals serving as reservoirs or key hosts for most genotypes in humans. The study analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella glA genotypes, including 67 new genotypes, and found evidence of exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wildlife animals due to increased contact. To protect health, care should be taken to avoid contact between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife. The findings show Bartonella is a system for examining impacts of humans on infectious disease spread within and between species, across landscapes, and the globe. Phylogenetic inferences about origin should be interpreted with caution due to available data and taxa sampled. The pathogen is ideal for tracing zoonotic potential and impacts on native hosts. The study constructed global phylogenies of Barton from 16S rRNA and citrate synth (glA) to determine evolutionary history, patterns, host switching, and spillo into humans from commensals to wild species. Some host specificity is due to ecological factors rather than immunological incompatibility. Diversity of zoonotic strains includes divergent strains with clinical presentations, physicians should consider broad hosts and Barton genotypes when investigating suspected infections. Particular species associated with humans, such as dogs, cats, cows, and rats, brought strains globally, with rats in the largest clade of rodent Barton.
Long noncoding RNA MALAT regulates cell cycle progression by modulating the expression of oncogenic transcription factor BMYB. MALAT is upregulated in cancer tissues and its elevated expression is associated with hyperproliferation, but the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses in human diploid fibroblasts reveal MALAT modulates expression of cell cycle genes and is required for G1 and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. The cycle defects in MALAT-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating p53 is a major mediator of MALAT activity. Furthermore, MALAT-depleted cells display reduced expression of MYB, an oncogenic factor in G/M progression due to altered splicing of MY preRNA and aberrant splicing. In cells, MALAT promotes proliferation by modulating expression and preRNA of cycle-regulated transcription factors. MAL levels during cell stages influence expression of genes in cycle. MALAT depletion in human fibroblasts induces DNA-damage and activation of p53 and target. The cycle defects in MAL-depleted cells are sensitive to p levels, indicating p is effector of MAL function. Mitotic in MAL-de cells suggest MAL role in mitosis regulating expression/preRNA of genes in or defect in p-deficient is result damaged or replication. Mitosis scored most canonical pathway downregulated in MAL-de fibroblasts. Abnormal MAL expression in types or tissues results aberrant splicing to misexpression genes in cycle and/or death, contributing to progression. MALAT could influence regulators activator or repressor, resulting in alteration of downstream cycle genes. Observed splicing changes regulator MY in MAL-de cells. Unlike MAL-de, p or p+MAL cells responded to serum expression genes in cycle.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction. While its action in repressing larval metamosis is well understood, the molecular basis of its promotion of adult reproduction is not fully elucidated. Methop-tolerant (Met), the J receptor, mediates J action during metamosis and vitelogenesis, but the precise mechanism of the latter is lacking. Researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to phenocopy J-deprived migratory locusts, demonstrating that J stimulates DNA replication and ploidy in preparation for vitelogenesis. Mc4 and Mc7, genes in the replication pathway, were expressed in the presence of J and Met. Depletion of Mc or Mc inhibited novo synthesis and ploidy, resulting in reduction of vitelogenin mRNA and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility assays showed Met directly regulates Mc and Mc by binding upstream sequences with E-box or E-like motifs. This suggests the J-receptor acts on Mc and Mc to regulate replication and ploidy for vitelogenesis and oocyte maturation.
A randomized controlled trial, the "Treatment of Early Neurop in Lepros" (TENL), investigated the effectiveness of 20 versus 32 weeks of prednisone treatment in patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI) due to leprosy. 868 patients were included, 429 in the 20-week arm and 439 in the 32-week arm. Prednisone was started at 45-60mg/day, depending on body weight, and tapered throughout follow-up, NFI was assessed by muscle testing and monofilament. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored function at 78 weeks. Secondary outcomes included Reaction Scale, SAL Scale, and Participation Scale. At 78, the proportion of patients with improved or restored function did not differ between groups: 78.1% in 20 arm and 77.5 in 32 arm (p=0.821). No differences in secondary outcomes, except a higher proportion of Serious Events in longer arm. A 20-week prednisone course was as effective as 32 in improving and restoring NFI in lepro patients, making 20 the preferred treatment duration for neuropathy, with a minority requiring individualized treatment.
Researchers studied the vocalizations of male Rocky Mountain elk (Cerv elus nelsoni) and European Red Deer (Cerv elus scus) to understand how sound production relates to anatomy and physiology. A finite element model of the larynx and wave model of vocal tract, based on elk morphology and biomechanics, simulated sound production. The model produced a wide range of fundamental frequencies, with low frequencies requiring low vocal fold strain, large lung pressure, and glottal flow, while high-frequency bugles required large muscular effort, high pressure, and least 10 dB intensity. Glottal efficiency, ratio of radiated sound to aerodynamic power, was higher in elk, suggesting an advantage in high-pitched signaling. This is due to lower airflow for aerodynamic power and acoustic advantage at higher frequencies. Both types are used by males during mating, serving as honest signals, relating to physical qualities of the sender. Low-frequency (Red call) relates to body size, high-frequency (bugle) to muscular strength and endurance. The trade-off between pitch production and larynge stress works for elk, with glott efficiency increasing with frequency, providing an advantage for high vocalizations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-through sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, a technique used to map transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications, by incorporating reads that map to multiple locations on the genome (multi-reads). Current methods only use reads that map uniquely to the reference genome (uni-reads), discarding up to 30% of alignable reads. The new approach allocates multi-read as fractional counts using a weighted scheme, increasing sequencing depth by 22-25% and 17% in STAT1 and GATA1 IP samples, respectively. This leads to detection of novel peaks not identifiable by uni-reads, particularly in highly repetitive and low-mappability regions. Multi-read peaks have similar characteristics to uni-read peaks, but mostly reside in segmental duplications. Validation of GATA multi-read peaks by quantitative real-time ChIP confirms novel targets. This study highlights the importance of multi-read in studying transcription factor binding in repetitive regions with IP-seq experiments.
Researchers estimated the economic benefits of achieving the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for four neglected tropical diseases: African trypanosomiasis, lepro, visceral leishias, and Chagas disease, controlled or eliminated by innovative and intensified management (IDM). The study used a systematic review of literature on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPP) related to these diseases, combined with projections of the number of people affected individuals and countries for 2011-2020 and 202-203. The ideal scenario where WHO targets are met was compared to a counterfactual scenario assuming no change from 1990. The economic benefit was the difference between the two scenarios, reported in 2005 US dollars, purchasing power-adjusted at 3% per annum from 201. Probabil sensitivity analyses quantified the uncertainty around the base estimate. The total productivity gained for the four IDM diseases was 23.1 (15.9-34) billion in 201-202 and 35.9 (25-51.9) in 202-203, corresponding to 10.7 (7.4-15.7) and 16.6 (11-24) in OPP reduction. The study faced limitations, including no OPP for lepro, combined data from various sources, heterogeneous, and variable quality. Despite this, the benefits of achieving targets are considerable, with plausible scenarios exceeding investments by endemic governments and partners. The frequency of NTD among the poorest households makes these investments valuable for improving well-being and reducing inequity.
In the auditory cortex, the selectivity of neurons increases as spiking evolves following the onset of a sound. Initially, neurons respond to a wide range of sounds with high average spiking rates, settling to lower values in the sustained epoch. Differential adaptation leads to fewer active neurons, resulting in a sparser representation and higher selectivity. This feature is shared among multiple sensory systems. The prevailing theory posits that unselective responses encode presence and selective responses encode identity. However, we found that the population conveys similar information across epochs despite selectivity differences. The amount of information is dependent on the total population spikes in the read window. Inhomogeneous Poisson spiking is sufficient to account for this property. This implies a novel principle of encoding potentially shared among sensory systems.
Researchers investigated the role of the co-stimulatory molecule O40 (OX) in controlling persistent viral infections, specifically in the context of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone 13. They found that OX40 is crucial for the maintenance of anti-viral T cells, as cells lacking the OX receptor fail to accumulate and germinal center responses and antibody production are severely impaired. OX-deficient mice fail to control LCMV13 infection over time. O40 signaling promotes long-term survival of T cells and shapes both CD4 and CD8 T responses during persistent LCMV13 infection, including T-dependent antibody responses. In contrast to acute LCM infection, O40 plays a significant role in chronic infection with ongoing viral replication. PD-1 expression correlates with O40 expression, suggesting sustained O40 is a consequence of ongoing antigen recognition. O40 is expressed on both CD4 and a subset of CD8 T cells. The study establishes O40 as a key factor in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence, with implications for studying T dysfunction in humans.
Researchers have identified a convergent evolution of mechanically optimal locomotory patterns in aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates, specifically in the use of elongated fins for swimming. This trait has evolved independently at least eight times across three phyla, including vertebrates and invertebrates. The optimal wavelength of undulation (OS) of an animal's fin during swimming, calculated by dividing length of undulation by mean amplitude, is consistently around 20. This value maximizes force generated by the body and swimming speed. The researchers hypothesize a mechanical basis for this optimality and suggest common genetic networks underlying its emergence. Unlike convergently evolved morphological features, this trait is a pattern of movement across morphologically diverse appendages. Animals undulate elongated fins while keeping bodies relatively rigid, unlike trout-like tail fins. Regulation of OS, elongation, and fination in observed phyla may be due to common genetic networks, as seen in electric organ convergent evolution. The OS and mean undulation amplitude predict number of undulations along a swimming fin at any velocity. This links physical principles to biological phenomena, explaining convergence or divergence of solutions. The study unifies diverse swimming organisms, from cuttlefish to cartilaginous and bony fish. The prevalence of body/caud fin in ancestral species does not explain slower swimming forms exhibited by median paired fin animals. Convergently evolved anatomical specializations minimize trunk movement during caud fin, resulting in pure thrust, seen in thunn swimmers like tuna and lamnid sharks.
Researchers investigated the role of condens, a class of evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, in neural stem cell (NS) divisions during cerebral cortex development. They found that two types of condens complexes, condens I and II, are essential for NS divisions and survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condens causes severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, leading to DNA damage and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condens I and II lead to slower loss of NS, with distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation in condin II-depleted NS and mitotic delays in condin I-depleted NS. NS depleted of condin II display hyperclustering perentric heterochatin and nucleoli, indicating condin II's role in establishing interphase architecture. These defects persist in postmit neurons. The study demonstrates overlapping and non-overlapping functions of condens I and II in NS, providing insight into balancing acts of the two complexes.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, which exhibits gonochorism, a rare among hermaphroditic trematodes. The parasite's sex is determined by a female heterogametic system, but phenotypic sexual dimorphism appears only after infection of the vertebrate host. The study analyzed the transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage and sex-comparative manner, performing RNA-seq on males and females at five developmental stages: cercaria, three in vivo schosulum stages, and adults. 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between sexes at least one stage, with 4,065 functionally annotated. Transcript data were complemented with H3me3 histone modification analysis using ChIP-seq before cercaria and after adults. The study identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-based players of interaction with vertebrate host, and dynamic of H3me3 histone mark between sexes as illustration of sex-based epigenetic landscapes. Results suggest that sexual differentiation in S. mans is accompanied by distinct male and female transcription landscapes of host-parasite cstalk, genetic determinants and epigen regulators. This could lead to sexual dimorphism of parasitic species. S. mans is pathogenic for humans, this study provides promising therapeutic targets, not only on parasite development interaction with vertebrate, but also reproductive function insights.
Researchers propose an approach to address disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts by assigning a confidence value to each annotation, representing the probability of correctness. They develop two probabilistic models to estimate annotator-specific parameters from data and apply them to a corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts and a 1,000 sentences by five additional annotators. The approach significantly increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation even in the worst-case scenario of all annotator disagreement. The study aims to quantify certainty in individual annotations for a group of annotators, retaining the dataset for training and testing machine learning. The models are based on a corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated by three experts, with a subset of 1,000 further annotated by five annotators. The corpus represents a specialized curation task, but the approach is generalizable to most annotation studies. A second annotation cycle is performed to validate the models, with five annotators annotating a random subset of 1,000 sentences from the original 10,000. The goal is to generate a manually annotated corpus for training computers to perform tasks at scale.
Researchers have developed a DNA-based vaccine platform to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, to protect against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a disease caused by Andes virus (AND) and AND-like viruses in South America. Convalescent human plasma shows promise as a treatment, but availability is limited due to the lethal nature of the disease. Geese were vaccinated with an AND DNA vaccine encoding the envelope glycoproteins, developing high-titerizing antibodies after the second vaccination and maintaining levels over 1 year. A booster resulted in high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Analysis of Ig and IgΔ by epitope mapping showed reactivity to specific amino sequences of AND envelope glyrote. The protective efficacy of goose-derived antibody was examined in a hamster model of lethal PS. α-AND immune sera or Ig/IgΔ purified from eggs were passively transferred to hamsters starting 5 days after challenge with AND (25 LD). Both immune and egg-derived Ig/IgΔ protected 8/8 and 7/8 hamsters, respectively. In contrast, hamsters receiving Ig/Ig from normal ge or no-treatment developed HPS. This demonstrates the DNA/goose platform can produce a candidate antiral product preventing lethal when administered post-exposure.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Dn3 enzyme in maintaining normal DNA methylation patterns and its impact on cancer development. D3 is required for establishing and maintaining methylation, and mutations in D3 have been linked to leukemia. Deletion of D3 in a K-r-dependent mouse lung cancer model promoted tumor progression, suggesting it might suppress tumor development by stabilizing methylation. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing revealed profound methylation changes in K-r induced lung cancer. D3 wild-type tumors had large hypomethylated domains corresponding to lamina-associated regions, while D-deficient tumors showed uniformly hypomethyl genome. Further analysis showed D is required for efficient methylation of active domains and D-deficient tumors had moderate deregulation in these domains. The study defines features of cancer methylomes and D's role in maintaining methylation in cancer.
Researchers have identified a mesoscopic pattern of neural activity in the premotor cortex of songbirds that supports the generation of sequences of neural activity. Using multi-electrophysiology and calcium imaging, they found that neural activity in the premotor cortex is correlated over a scale of 100 micrometers, with basal ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons firing at a specific phase of a 30 Hz rhythm. This indicates that premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and a mesoscopic dynamics underlies the generation of neural sequences controlling song. In singing birds, the relationship between time and space in premotor area HVC is neither random nor globally organized as a traveling wave, but clustered on 100 μm length. A 30 Hz rhythm in local field potential (LFP) correlated with inhibition influences the timing of one projection neuron type, HX, and this rhythm is coherent over length matching projection calcium activity. Activity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are spatially clustered, with two types HX neurons and H interneurons firing in alternating phases of local 30 Hz rhythm. Inhibitory neurons show patterned activity throughout song, whereas projection neurons fire sparsely, with calcium events correlated between neighbors. This suggests a microcircuit where multiple excitatory neurons drive interne populations. The recurrence of length and rhythmic times across species and contexts suggests spatial and 30 rhythmic alternation may be a feature of cortical microcircuits for sequential behavior.
Researchers have identified 64 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans that, when inactivated, extend lifespan, and are highly conserved from yeast to humans. These genes are essential for growth and development, but their role in longevity was not previously assessed. The genes were screened from 2,700 essential for C. elegans development. Classification into functional groups revealed insulin and metabolic pathways, but also enrichment for translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Many essential gene inactivations extend lifespan as much as known regulators of aging. Early inactivation of these genes caused growth arrest at larval stages, and some animals live longer than wild-type adults. d-16 is required for survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity is a response to gene inactivation. Results suggest insulin-signaling plays a role in aging regulation at any stage of life. Lifespan is regulated by genetic and environmental influences in species. Recent work identified components of cellular processes that regulate lifespan. C. elegans loss-function in insulin/insulin growth-1/daf-2 pathway doubles lifespan. Regulation by D-2 occurs during adulthood. C. elegans lifespan extended when fed RNA targeting insulin/d-2 at any larval stage through adulthood. Conditional d-2 alleles cause arrest if inactivated at L stage, but longevity inactivated in adults. Null d-2 alleles are lethal demonstrating uncoupling developmental and aging phenotypes of genes.
Researchers have identified a critical role for laminin beta 1 (lamba) in the regeneration of the epidermis during zebraf fin regeneration. Lamin beta 1 is a component of the extracellular matrix and is induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial layer. This process is necessary for the expression of morphogenetic factors such as shha and le1, basal positioning of phosphorylated Ig1, patterning of osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. Lamin 1 function is dispensable for juvenile growth, homeostatic tissue, adult maintenance, repair of fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblast. Mutations in fg20 or transgenic fg receptor inhibition disrupt lamba expression, linking fg to epithelial maturation during regeneration. Fgf20 is induced during zraf fin regeneration and fg20 mutants are defective in le1 induction and maturation of the epidermis.
Researchers compared the performance of several linear mixed model (LMM) approaches and software packages, including EMM, GenABEL, FaSTMM, Mend, GEM, and MMM, in a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmanias in 348 Brazilian families with 362 individuals. The study found strong concordance between results from different LMM approaches and success in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches applied to longitudinal data with repeated measures. LMMs also showed high correlation with alternative approaches, apart from transmission-based when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. The study concluded that LMM perform well compared to competing approaches, with choice of implementation based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use rather than power I error. 

The study applied LMM to real and simulated data from a genome association study of visceral leishias in 348 families, comprising 363 individuals with genotype and phenotype data. The Brazilian data set was used with a larger case/control set by Fola et al. The analysis was computationally convenient using standard L software, as GWAS was slow on the data. A caveat is that results relate to genotypes from a single data set, the Brazilian study of leishmanias. The study focused on results using a pruned set of SNPs to estimate kinships for genome analysis in Mend, which uses the entire set of SN by default. The performance of L and alternative approaches were compared through application to real and simulated data from the Brazilian set Fola et al The kin coefficients between pairs of individuals were estimated prior to fitting the linear model on genome data, rather than theoretical values.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that inhibit the infection of mammalian cells by Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. A 200-compound library was screened using a recombinant T. cruzi strain expressing β-galactosidase. Three compounds, P1, NT, and CX, were selected for their high activity against T. cruz and low toxicity to host cells in vitro, with IC50 values of 54, 190, and 23 nM, respectively. Each compound has a different mechanism of action on intracellular proliferation of T. cruziastigotes. CX shows trypanocidal activity, essential for the development of drugs against the chronic stage of Chagas disease, where parasites are found intracellular in quiescent stage. NT has tryostatic effect, while P1 affects parasite division. The compounds also show activity against intracellular T. cruz from Y and related species Leishmania and L. Characterization of anti-T. cruz activity of molecules related to the library allowed selection of two compounds with IC50 of 2M, P6 and CX. These values are approximately 100 times lower than medicines used against T. cruz. Results provide new candidates for treatments against Chagas and leishiasis.
Researchers have developed a novel point-of-care diagnostic platform, termed "Backpack PCR," for the detection of Brugia parasites in mosquitoes, which are vectors of lymphatic filariasis. The platform combines a rapid NaOH-based DNA extraction method with a portable, battery-powered PCR and strip-based detection assay. This approach eliminates the need for expensive and time-consuming silica-based DNA extractions and thermal cyclers or real-time PCR instruments, making it suitable for resource-limited locations. The researchers evaluated the performance of the NaOH extraction method against standard column-based techniques and compared the strip-based assay to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis, demonstrating sensitive and specific detection of parasite DNA from mosquito pools. They also compared laboratory-based thermal cycling with field miniaturized PCR, showing the potential for point-of-collection use of the entire platform, compact enough to fit into a backpack. The "Back PCR" system provides an alternative to cost-prohibitive column extractions and detection methodologies requiring advanced infrastructure, increasing molecular monitoring feasibility in B. malayi-endemic areas. The platform is adaptable to detection of W. bancfti and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. A series of 50 mosquito samples underwent Na-based extraction, PCR amplification using standard and mini instruments, followed by gel electrophores and strip detection, validating the field-friendly platform's sensitivity to real-time PCR. Development of a "Back" assay for W. banci, responsible for 90% of global LF burden, is underway, and the method can be extended to other mosquito-borne infections like malaria, Zika, deng fever, Chikunya.
Researchers have developed a theoretical model to study the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins, which have evolved independently multiple times through evolution. These proteins are composed of alternating domains of elastom and cross-link elements, where the former provide elasticity and drive assembly, and the latter stabilize the polymer. Changes in the number and arrangement of these domains significantly impact assembly and mechanical properties. The study used a simulation of diffusion-limited aggregation to model the self-assembly of rod-like particles with different architectures, generating various aggregates analyzed by graph-theoretic metrics. Results show that the relative length and number of elastom and cross-link domains impact morphology and structural integrity of the polymeric structure. Highly connected polymers were formed from rods with large cross-link elements interspersed with smaller elastom domains. This study provides insights into the evolution of elastom proteins and guides the design of novel biomaterials.
Researchers have investigated the function of the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) in the genome of the Ebola virus, a highly lethal zoonotic pathogen. They found that the 5-UTRs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES) and instead regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a reporter gene. The 5-UT from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation compared to a beta-actin 5-UT. The 5-UT contains four upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and ablating each uUG enhanced translation of the primary open reading frame (ORF), most dramatically in the case of the L 5-UT. The uUG was sufficient to initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Koz sequence and suppressed ORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIFα was phosphorylated, the presence of uOR maintained translation of LOR, indicating u modulates translation in response to cellular stress. To address the role of uUG in virus replication, a recombinant Ebola was generated with uUG mutated to UCG. Mutating two nucleotides outside previously-defined protein and cis-regulatory sequences attenuated virus titers 10-100 lower than wild-type in Vero A549 cells.
Researchers have developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes, revealing non-random and fragmented DS hotspots scattered along chromosomes, delimiting 50-250 kb domains. About 30% of these domains possess coordinately expressed genes, with PAR1 and HNPA2B1 binding to DNA at domain termini. This suggests a novel type of gene regulation: coordinated transcription silencing of clusters within chromosomal domains protected by DS hotspots and PAR1 and HN2B1 binding sites. The study highlights the relationship between chromosomal fragile sites, organization, and gene regulation, which may be crucial for cancer and genomics and therapy. DSBs have been studied for years due to aberrant repair and chromosomal damage leading to genomic rearrangements, driving cancer development by deleting tumor suppressor genes, amplifying oncogenes, and causing oncogenic fusions. Deep-sequencing data indicate non-random DS with blunt ends defining 50-250 kb domains protected from breaks. Transcription profiling shows domains contain coordinately expressed clusters, suggesting regulation within genomic regions delimited by DS hotspots. PAR1 and HN2B1 bind specifically to forum termini, involved in chromatin and transcription regulation and RNA processing. The study indicates fragile sites in human chromosomes and technique for studying fragile sites in various cells.
Researchers conducted a study on trypanosomat infection in bats from two areas with different levels of degradation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, specifically Reserva Ecológica Guçu (REG) and Estação Florestal Mata Atlântica (EFMA). The study aimed to evaluate the diversity of trypanomatids according to bat diversity and preservation levels in the region. The results showed no influence of preservation level on bat species richness, with 15 and 14 species respectively, and higher abundance of two fruit-eating bat species, Carollia persillata and Artus litatus. Of 181 specimens analyzed, 24 (13%) were infected, including one Sira individual positive by blood examination. Molecular characterization using PCR targeting 18S rRNA gene showed similar tryosid infection rates in both areas, 15% in REG and 11 in EF (p=0.46). Tryosomaionii was the most detected parasite (54%), followed by T cruz DTI and TIV and Tryos sp, in Neotropical phlost bats. Mixed infections were observed. T DTI and TIV are genotypes involved in cases of Chagas disease in Brazil, and dionii was found in heart tissue of infected child. Surprisingly, Cridia mellae, a putative monoxen parasite from insects, infecting vertebrate in Americas, was described.
A study was conducted to evaluate the prevalence of 38 pathogens and symbionts in Ixodes ricinus ticks in the Ardennes region of France. High-throughput real-time PCR was used to detect 37 bacteria and parasites, RT-PCR for Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBE), and nested PCR for four symbionts. The results showed that 45% of ticks were co-infected with up to five pathogens, and when including symbion prevalence, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism and up to eight were identified in the same tick. Possible interactions between pathogens suggested a strong association between Borrelia burgdorii and B afii, while no significant interactions were found between symbts and pathogens. The study revealed high pathogen co-infection rates, raising questions about co-transmission to humans and animals, and consequences to health. High rates of symbts co-existing with pathogens were also found, opening avenues for research on effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand the hematopoietic eryth-myoid lineage decision, which is governed by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA.1. Prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels, and understanding the underlying molecular circuitry is crucial not only for hematopoies but also for developmental systems in general. The model reveals a mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner, necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior. The PU.1-GATA switch interacts with another antagonistic pair, FOG-1, inheriting the state of upstream genes and reinforcing decision through feedback, leading to irreversible commitment. The switch is an example of a network implementing prim and committed states by cooperativity through cofactor recruitment. Perturbing feedback between regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies. The approach points a framework for lineage studies and could aid search-determining genes.

The hematopoies have several branch points with key factors and signals. The PU.1 and GATA govern eryth-myoid lineages, demonstrating commitment and priming features. Both are autoregulatory, providing stability once expressed. EKLF-F1 inherits PU.1/ATA decision, regulating eryth lineage. The model illustrates commitment in architecture with antagonistic pairs reinforcing decisions, positive feedback, robust commitment. Noise effects are not addressed. Interactions in committed eryroid cells play at earlier stages unclear. The PU.1-GAT switch exhibits bistability, expected in determining two lineages. Future models query similar architectures. Irreversibility of eryth-myoid switch through FOG-1 feedback is explored.
Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen with intrinsic resistance to lysozym, a key effector of the innate immune system, due to a complex network of transcriptional regulators and genes (A, pgA, dA, and sigV) that inhibit enzymatic and antimicrobial activities of lysozym. Researchers sought to identify novel genes modulating E. faalis resistance to lyzym through random transposon mutagenesis in a quadruple oat/pgA/dA/dA/sig mutant, leading to the identification of insertions in the enteroccal polyschar antigen (EPA) region downstream of conserved epA-ep genes. The ep region was previously proposed to be responsible for EPA decoration, but its role remained unknown. This study shows EPA decoration contributes to resistance to antimicrobials and virulence in zebraf infection by conferring resistance phagocytosis. Results indicate production of EPA rhamopolyschar backbone is not sufficient for E. faalis infections, revealing an essential role of modification for enteroccal pathogenesis. Several genes contributing to EPA decoration play a role in resistance effectors of innate system and virulence. Deletion of pgA in L monocogen is associated with 32-fold decrease in resistance. Transposon mutagenesis of OP strain showed disruption of genes encoding EPA decoration increases E fa resistance lyzym. In-frame deletion in wild-type background had same effect.
Researchers have developed a new model called RER (Regression of Combined Expression) to analyze gene regulation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) by integrating data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). The model infers sample-specific regulatory activities of transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs, which are then used to infer TF-microRNA interactions. This two-stage framework overcomes the challenge of integrating ENCODE data from generic cell lines with sample-specific TCG measurements. AML data from TCG and TF binding data from K562 in EN were used as a case study. The model was verified through 10-fold cross-validation predicting gene expression and showed superior performance over existing methods in detecting miRNA/TF targets. A feature selection identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered with cytogenetic risk, including miR-548, whose targets were enriched in leukemia-related pathways, implicating its role in AML pathogenesis. Survival analysis using inferred activities as a potential AML prognostic marker. RER successfully integrated TCG and EN data revealing AML regulatory program at a global level.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsum, a species that causes disease in various crops worldwide. Knockout mutants were generated for three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), Dicer (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO) proteins to study RNAi function. No effects on vegetative growth were observed in mutants grown on complex or minimal media. However, Δcl, ΔclΔcl, and Δago strains showed defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Total RNA and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains. Greatest effects on both populations were in Δcl, ΔclΔcl, andago, which derepressed a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletum higginsum nonsegmented dsRNA 1 (ChV). Phylogenetic analyses showed a close relationship between ChV and segmented Partitiviridae, despite nonsegmented genome. Immunoprecipitation of RNAs with AGO showed abundant loading 5U-containing siRNAs. Higginsum parental and Δcl strains cured of ChV revealed conid and spore morphology defects primarily caused by Ch. Based on results, RNAi involving DCL and AGO in C is proposed as antiviral mechanism.

 Knockout mutants and high-through sequencing were used to functionally characterize transcriptomes and small RNAs in C mycelia. AGO and DCL were critical for maintaining low accumulation of novel dsRNA, designated ChV. However, it is unclear if R1, R2, and R3 are functional during growth and conidiation or redundant, as combinator mutants not analyzed. Deletion analysis revealed D and AG both affect conidia and asexual spore morphology C. To identify loci affected by RNA factors, particularly D and transcripts small from all strains were analyzed.

Colotrichum higginsum (IM 349A) wild-type used corresponds sequenced isolated from Brassica rap (Trinidad), provided by Dr. OConnell. Fungal deficient in RNA machinery (ago,ago,cl,cl,cl,cl,clcl,cl,dr,dr,dr, anddr) obtained by replacement. Growth ofcl,cl,cl, andclcl mutant indistinguishable from wild-type all media, suggesting RNA-mediated not necessary vegetative under abiotic conditions. Results agreement with silencing mutants yeasts castii and neo. Conid analyzed all strains after growth media seven days. Higginsum wild-type recipient disruptions confirmed RT-PCR D identifying independent mutants conidia. Virus-freecl produced average 10.5 conidia more ChV-infectedcl, demonstrating 8.8 increase conidia.
A study investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase MOF in meiotic expansion of H2 phosphorylation and spermatogenesis in mice. Three waves of H2 phosphorylation have been observed during meiotic prophase I: the first ATM-dependent at leptotene, the second and third ATR-dependent at zygot and pachene, respectively. The third wave of H2 phosphorylation marks unsynapsed chromosomes. MOF was found to be involved in all three waves of H2 phosphorylation expansion. Germ cell deletion of MO in spermatocytes caused loss of H4ac in leptene and zgot spermatocytes, resulting in γ2 signals only along chromosomal axes and chromatin-wide H2 phosphorylation loss. In early-mid pachene spermatocytes, γ2 and M1 were detected along unsyn axes but failed to expand, causing meiotic sex inactivation failure. RAD51 was proficiently recruited to double-strand break sites, but defects in repair and crossover were observed, indicating MO facilitates meiotic repair after RAD51 recruitment. MO regulates meiosis and expansion of three waves H2 phosphorylation from leptene to pach stages initiated by ATM and ATR. MO deletion blocked chromatin-wide H2 phosphorylation in leptene spermatocytes, but γ2 foci could be observed, indicating not required for initiation. A similar pattern was observed in zgot spermatocytes. MO is involved in expansion, not initiation, of first two waves HAX phosphorylation. Two waves of chromatin-wide H2 phosphorylation are preserved in M1-deficient mice and M1-independent. The third wave of HAX phosphorylation is specific and essential in pachene spermatocytes.
Researchers investigated the effects of Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection on human T-cell development in the thymus of "Immune System" Rag-2/-γ- mice. These mice were infected with HT-1 at a time when three subpopulations of thymocytes have been detected. In all inoculated mice, HT-1 provirus was found in thymocytes, and proviral load increased with length of infection. HT- infected mice showed alterations in T development, correlated with proviral load. Mature single-positive (SP) CD4 and CD8 cells were numerous at expense of immature double-positive (DP) thymocytes in thus of HT- infected Rag-/- mice. These cells accumulated in spleen. Lymphocytes from thus and spleen were activated, shown by expression of CD25, correlated with presence of tax and increased of NF-κB dependent genes such as Bcl-1, anti-apopt gene in thym. Hepatosplenomegaly lymphopathy and lymphoma/thymoma were observed in HT- infected mice several months after infection. These results demonstrate potential of Rag-/- animal to elucidate initial steps of leukogenic process by HT-1.
In Sudan, schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern, particularly Schistosoma haematium infection. An integrated control program was implemented in Alab locality, White State, Sudan from 2009-2011, targeting 78,615 primary school students out of 482,902 population. Prevalence of S. haematium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. Follow-up after 6-9 months post-treatment, prevalence S. haematium reduced to 13.5% (95%CI=0.331-0.462), with higher reduction in girls and rural residents. Health education increased awareness and clean water supply at Alida village reduced infection rate compared to neighboring village. No change in S. mans infection prevalence between baseline and follow-up (95%CI=0.9336-891). Prevalence S haemat reduced by 50% at project end. Approximately 200,000 received praziquel therapy, education, or clean water. Integrated intervention should be adapted to consolidate achievements.
Researchers have investigated the role of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the Nip virus matrix protein (Ni-M) in viral budding. Nip virus (Ni) is a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus that causes encephalitis in humans and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 (B4) pathogen. During Ni infection, Ni-M was first detected in the nucleus at early stages before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization (NLS) and leucine-rich nuclear export (NES) signals in Ni-M impaired nuclear-ctoplasm trafficking and abolished Ni budding. A conserved lysine residue in NLS mediated nuclear import and was also a site for monoubiquination regulating export. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced Ni budding, while depletion via proteas inhibitors resulted in nuclear retention and blocked budding. Live Ni virus was sensitive to proteas inhibitors, with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, a 100-fold less than peak plasma concentration achievable in humans. This suggests an off-the-shelf therapeutic against Ni infection.
Researchers have developed an imaging assay to track the entry of poliovirus (PV) into live cells, allowing them to characterize early events in the infection process. The study aimed to understand how non-enveloped viruses, such as PV, deliver their genomes into cells, which is poorly understood due to technical difficulties in visualizing viral delivery and distinguishing productive and non-productive pathways. The assay combined live-cell imaging of viral capsid and genome with an infectivity-based RNA release assay. Results show that PV genome release is efficient and rapid, not limiting overall infectivity or infection rate. PV binds to cell surface receptors and enters through a clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, and microtubule-independent, tyrosine kinase and actin-dependent endocytic mechanism. After internalization, genome release occurs from vesicles or sealed invaginations within 100-200 nm of plasma membrane. This settles debate on whether PV directly breaks plasma barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver genome into cell.
In rural Cambodia, dengue fever remains a significant public health concern, particularly affecting children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDC) relies heavily on education as a means of prevention and control, delivering it to communities and schools. An ethnographic study conducted in 2003-2004 in eastern Cambodia explored the approaches used in education and their effectiveness in controlling deng. Community education through health centre activities and campaigns is provided by the NDC, but is underfunded and delivered irregularly, while school-based education is limited in time and lacks follow-up in practical activities for prevention and control, resulting in partial adherence.

Health education plays a crucial role in informing and encouraging people to participate in preventing and controlling deng as transmissible diseases. However, in resource-poor countries, the efficacy of health education is complicated by economic, political, and infrastructural factors. In Cambodia, deng health education delivered through outreach and school programs is insufficient, underfunded. This does not indicate a reduced need for education, but local prevention and control involving community members through education in community and schools offers potential to reduce deng prevalence. However, this cannot occur where education is poorly resourced and episodic and attention is not paid to translation to practice.

Two factors impact outreach: political commitment and availability of resources. This article explores input, process, and effectiveness of community HC and school education for deng control addressing this gap. Challenges facing deng prevention in Cambodia are elucidated. No specific model was used to structure health activities or education; strategy and content developed to include activities, information, practices regarded important to d controleng and mortality. Community education through radio, television, billboards, banners, posters, and leaflets. Existing deng education materials must be redefined practical and applicable. Little training in health education for practitioners during training or in-service, lacking skills, perceiving education not part of work.
Researchers investigated the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes into the bloodstream of infected hosts. Using miRNA sequencing and bioinformatics, they identified over 200 mature miRNA sequences of nematode origin in Dirofia imis-infected dog plasma and 21 in Onchocerca volulus-infected human serum. Total RNA from D imis-infected dog plasma was subjected to stem-loop RT-qPCR assays targeting two miRNA candidates, mi-71 and mi-34, which were also detected in Brugia pangi-infected dog samples. The presence of mi-71 and mi34 discriminated infected from uninfected samples, but absolute miRNA numbers were not correlated with microfilaria counts. This may be due to imprecision of mf counts or mi contributions from unknown number of adult worms. Parasite-derived miRNAs were found in plasma or serum for species not living in bloodstream. A large number of candidate miRNAs were identified in mammalian hosts infected with several filarial nematodes, with 245 and 261 miRNAs in independent samples from heartworm-infected dogs, 96 of which were present in both samples. Over 200 miRNA sequences of D imis-origin were found in infected dog plasma, 21 in human serum predicted to be released by Ovolulus. RT-q assays were developed to discriminate imis-infected or pangi-inf versus uninf, without reflecting counts and poorly mi copy quantification.
Researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain of Src tyrosine kinases to study the conformational changes that occur during activation. The model incorporates experimental structures of the inactive and active states of the kinase and simulates the dynamics of conformation transitions. By constructing a structural network of clusters from the simulations, two major pathways for activation are identified. The first pathway involves a coordinated switching of interactions among the α helix, activation loop, and β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. The second pathway is coupled to a partial unfolding of the N-lo region of the catalytic domain. The study also characterizes the switching mechanism of the α helix and activation in detail. A Markov model is tested for its ability to account for structural kinetics in the context of conformation changes. The results provide a framework for understanding the conformation transition taking place upon Src activation.
Researchers have identified the genetic basis of lethality in F1 hybrids between Arabidopsis thaliana with different ploidy levels. They found a single-effect QTL, DSL1, and two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL1, which affects postzygotic lethality via maternal expression in the sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL in an interval encoding the maternal transcription factor TT2. Maternal parents with loss-of-function in TT2 suppressed F1 lethality caused by paternal interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was affected by natural variation and tt2 loss-function mutants. The genetic basis of natural variation and single-gene mutations suggests F leth in polloids could evolve rapidly. The role of sporophytic TT2 in interplo crosses indicates developmental programming of the mother regulates viability of interplo hybrid offspring. The study shows that leth in polypids can be mediated by single-gene mutations in the sporophyte.
Researchers conducted a comparative evolutionary analysis of bacterial pathogens in bats and rodents using Bartonella and Leptira as models. They analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes in 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella in 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira in 20 bats. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies were generated for hosts and bacteria, and coevolutionary congruence was tested using ParaFit, PAC, and Jane. Results showed significant coevolution between Bartonella and bat hosts (ParaFit=1.970, P≤0.001, m value=7.332, P0.000) and between Bartonella and rodent hosts (ParaFit=102.440, P.001, m=86.532, P.000). In contrast, Leptira and bats showed no coevolution (ParaFit=0.004, P=0.84, m=4.631, P.562). Separate analyses of New and Old World datasets yielded congruent results. Event-based phylogenies reconstructed evolutionary histories for each group, with Leptira bats having the most host switches (0.731) and Bartonella rodents the fewest (0.264). Bartonella exhibited coevolution with minimal switching, while Leptira lacked congruence and had high host switches. Differences in disease transmission and ecology likely underlie variable coevolution patterns. Understanding coevolution and host-switching between pathogens and hosts will predict spillo between mammal reservoirs and humans.
Researchers developed a forced oscillation framework to study how muscle contractions lead to movement in undulatory swimmers, such as fish and snakes. They used a chain model to understand how forcing causes deformation and movement, differentiating between muscle contractions (active swimming) and fluid forces (passive swimming). The study found that forcing triggers the first body deformation modes, which cause translational motion, and simple patterns can lead to complex kinematics. The frequency of muscle activation relative to the natural frequency of the oscillator is crucial for body deformation characteristics. The approach also explains optimal kinematics for fast swimming. Computational fluid dynamics simulations confirmed the results, supporting previous findings on optimal stiffness for maximum speed.

A chain model of undulatory swimming was used to investigate emergence and response to forcing. The system was forced by muscles, fluid, or both. The forced oscillation framework was applied to understand movement due to muscular and environmental forcing. For a given activation, the frequency relative to the natural frequency of the oscillator is important for emergent characteristics. Quantitative analysis showed power from muscle work is used in deformation and dissipated into fluid. A closed expression for swimming velocity was derived from equations of motion.

Movement in undulatory swimmers is emergent from muscle activation. Two issues exist: muscle to deformation and deformation to movement. The forced oscillation formulation was presented, then used to elucidate swimming generation. Examples of active and passive arose from types of forcing, discussing typical motions involve lower modes. Power transfer during the cycle was discussed.
Researchers investigated whether genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals can generate new strains of the human pathogen T. b. rhodesense (T), responsible for sleeping sickness (African Trypanosomias, H) in East Africa. They found that the trait of infectivity in T is conferred by a single gene, SRA, which is transferable to the animal pathogen T by sexual reproduction. By tracking the inheritance of S in crosses of T and T set by co-transmitting genetically-engineered parental tryosome lines through tse flies, S was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds by reproduction between T and T, creating new strains of the pathogen T. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of tryosomes carrying S. Although expression of S is critical to survival of T in the host, the gene exists as a single copy in representative of T strains. S was found on homologue chromosome IV in majority of T isolates, but Ugandan T had S on homologues. The mobility of S by recombination explains the genetic variability of T in Africa. New strains of the pathogen T are generated by recombination with the larger pool of animal-infect tryosomes. Novel recombinants present a risk for future outbreaks of H.
Researchers investigated the role of gap junction coupling in islet dysfunction in neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), a condition caused by β-cell dysfunction in the islets of Langerhans disrupting insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling between β-cells in the islet plays a crucial role in coordinating pulsatile insulin response to elevated glucose and suppressing insulin at basal glucose. The study used a murine model of NDM involving ATP-insensitive K channels and a multi-cell computational model of islet activity to examine how gap junction contributes to islet dysfunction. They verified the model against [Ca2 and insulin measurements in islets expressing-ins K channels under different levels of gap coupling and applied it to predict how K channel mutations in N suppress [2 and the role of junction in suppression. The model was extended to account for stochastic and insulin dynamics. Results showed that reductions in gap coupling allowed greater glucose-stimulated [2 and insulin following expression-ins K channels. The model demonstrated correspondence between suppression and clinical presentation of different N mutations Significant recoveries [2 and insulin were predicted for many upon junction reductions where noise played a role in recover.
Researchers have developed a framework to analyze gene transcription networks that accounts for retroactivity, a phenomenon causing modules to display context-dependent behavior. The framework uses three matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters (dissociation constants and concentrations) and topology. Internal retroactivity quantifies intramod connections' effect on isolated module dynamics, while scaling and mixing retro establish intermod connections' impact on connected modules. Based on these matrices and isolated module dynamics, the framework predicts how interconnection affects arbitrary modules' behavior. Implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retro are demonstrated on recurrent motifs, including autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle, and single motif. A metric is provided to determine dynamic robustness to interconnection, applicable to evaluate modularity in natural networks and design guidelines to minimize retroactivity in synthetic systems.
Researchers have investigated recombination in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the human genome, a region of homology between the X and Y chromosomes that has undergone rapid evolution. Crossover in PAR is essential for proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in meiosis, and deletion results in male sterility. The human PAR1 region has an exceptionally high crossover rate, 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average, but the mechanism of this crossover is unknown. A recent study in mice suggested crossovers in PAR may be mediated independently of PRDM9, which localizes crossovers in autosomes. To investigate recombination in this region, researchers constructed a fine-scale genetic map of crossovers using African-American pedigrees and analyzed recombination rates from linkage disequilibrium in human populations. They also identified PRDM binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells. Contrary to mice, PRDM does not localize recombination peaks in human PAR. Recombination is more rapid and intense in PAR than autosomes and hotspot activities differ among human populations. Additionally, hotspot positions have changed between human and chimpanzee with no sharing among hotspots.
Researchers have identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2/KDM4, known as Δ-JMJD2, which is required for skeletal muscle differentiation. In proliferating myoblasts, muscle genes are silenced by epigenetic modifications at their promoters, including histone H3 methylation. The depression of the promoter of the gene encoding myogenic myogen (My) is key for initiation of muscle differentiation. The mechanism of H3 demethylation at My promoter is unclear. Δ-JJD2 increases during differentiation of C2 myoblast into myubes and is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific expression. It promotes MyD-induced conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells. ChIP-chip analysis indicates Δ-J2 binds to genes involved in transcriptional control and this binding is linked to activation. Δ-J2 is recruited to My promoter at onset of differentiation, promoting demethylation of H3me and H3. The induction of Δ-J2 isoform is crucial for muscle differentiation by directing removal of repressive chromatin marks at My promoter, promoting transcription activation of My and contributing to initiation of muscle-specific expression. Genome-wide analysis shows Δ-J acts as transcription coactivator for genes induced during skeletal differentiation and binds to My promoter to regulate H methylation, allowing My expression and myot differentiation.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of absence of transmission in all countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of GWEP when the number of cases is low and cost per case is high. Using data from GW, the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages are estimated, and cost-effectiveness modeled for 1986-203. Two scenarios are compared: doing nothing (no intervention since 1986) and control (only surveillance and response 201-203). The cost per case averted, disability-adjusted life year (DAL) averted, and cost at-risk year averted are reported. Cost-effectiveness is assessed against a threshold of one GDP per capita (less than $500 in low-income countries). The GW cost is estimated $11.95 (4.70-12.49) per case averted 198-203. The pre-cert and certification phases cost $0.004 and $0.001 per capita per year. The DAL averted by GW relative to nothing is $222 (118-372) 198-203. GW is more cost-effective than control by 203. If costs are twice as high, GW will still be cost-effective relative nothing.
Researchers studied the protein BB32 from Borrelia burgdorferi, a bacterium that causes Lyme disease, to understand how it evades the human immune system's complement system. They found that the protein's carbox-terminal domain, BB32-C, binds to and inhibits the serine protease of the human complement's classical pathway, C1. The study investigated BB32 orthologs from other Lyme-associated Boria, B afii and Bgar, and found that Bafii BAD-C exhibited similar activity to BB32 in binding to C1 and inhibiting the complement. However, Bgarii B19-C had reduced activity. Site-directed mutagenesis created a chimeric protein, BX32, which mimicked B19's properties. The structure of BB32 was solved at 1.7Å resolution, revealing an anti-parallel four-helix fold with a protruding alpha-helix. The three targeted residues in BX32 are surface-exposed, supporting C1 binding and inhibition. BB32 only recognized C1 fragments containing the serine prote domain. The study improves understanding of BB32's recognition and inhibition of C1 and provides insight into Lyme spirochete evasion mechanisms.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation from commensalism to pathogenicity. Previous gene knockout studies have identified factors involved in this transformation, but how these factors are regulated remains unclear. Investigating post-translational phosphorylation has provided insights, focusing on cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. The F2 transcription factor is identified as a target of C28 and cell wall biosynthesis kinase C1, in a distinct role from its conserved function in cell cycle. In stationary yeast cells, 2D gel electrophoresis shows a diverse F2 phospho-forms. A window of hyal induction before START, phosphorylation transforms to yeast profile. This does not occur in stationary cells reinoculated into fresh medium. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified phosphorylated C28 and C1 residues. Substituting with nonosphory alanine altered yeast profile and abated hyal transformation. Transcript profiling revealed hyal phosphorylation required expression of genes in path, host interaction, and biofilm formation. Changes resulted in defects in pathogenic processes. F2 interacts chromatin modifier P3 in phosphorylation, providing a mechanism regulating specificity. A cell-independent phosphoregulatory event subverts cycle machinery to commal to pathity.
Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite, possesses both de novo and salvage pathways for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, rendering it non-reliant on salvage pyrimines for growth. Thymidine kinase (TK) catalyzes the formation of dTMP and dUMP, one of several enzymes redundant to the de novo pathway. Surprisingly, TK is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model, and catalytically active is required for function. Unlike humans and other kinetoplastids, T. bruce lacks dCMP deaminase (DD), providing an alternative to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DD rescued the RNAi growth phenotype and allowed selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling revealed buildup of deoxypyrim nucleides in TK depleted cells. Knock of cytidine deaminase (DA), converting deoxycidine to deuridine, led to thym/deuridine auxrophy. Unexpectedly, T. br encodes an unidentified 5-nucleidase converting deypyrim nucleides to nucleosides, leading to buildup in TK cells at expense of dTP pools. Bioinformatics identified candidate genes encoding 5-nid activity, including an HD protein phosphorylating deoxyonucle 5-monophosph. TK is essential for thym nucleides synthesis, regardless of nucleos precursors from de novo or salvage. In absence of DD, reliance on TK may be shared among trypanids, providing opportunity to target pathogenic eukaryotes with single drug.
Researchers investigated how translation initiation occurs in mRNAs that lack a Shine-Dalg sequence, a crucial for ribosome binding in prokary systems. They conducted genome-wide searches in various proaryotes and found that mRNAs without Shine-Darn sequences are less structured in their initiation region and show minimal folding at the start codon. Using reporter constructs in bacteria, they demonstrated that local RNA unfoldedness determines start cod recognition in Shine-Darn-independent translation. Results showed that AUG codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal codons are in structured mRNA regions. Bioinformatics and experimental data suggest that absence of secondary structure is necessary and sufficient for Shinearn-independent translation initiation. This provides a mechanism for recognizing the translation site in the absence of a ribosome site.
A study was conducted in Bihar, India, a region endemic for Leishmania donovani, where 874 patients with visceral leishmanias (VL) were treated with 20mg/kg liposomal amphotin B (Ambis) as first-line treatment. The study aimed to describe the characteristics of patients who developed post-kala dermal leishiasis (PKDL), a skin disorder occurring in up to 10% of VL patients in India. Over a 5-year period, Ambis was administered to 874 patients with laboratory-confirmed VL in four doses of 5/kg to total 20/kg, with a high cure rate (99.3%) and low default rate (0.3%). Patients received health education on PK symptoms and to return to the program if symptoms developed. Of 831 patients completing treatment, 24 (0.3%) returned with symptoms confirmed PK, diagnosed by history, appearance, and slit-skin examination. 89% had macular lesions, with median time to development 1.2 (0.8-2.2) years following treatment. Demographic and clinical characteristics of VL patients with Ambis who developed PK compared to those without did not show significant factors. However, time to PK was shorter with Ambis in a subset with previous stibogluconate treatment. In this cohort, PK following Amb appears infrequent with no risk factors. Time to PK compared to conventional treatments should be considered when counseling regimens including Ambis.
Researchers studied the re-infestation of Triatoma infans, the vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. They used continuous and discrete-time models to analyze patch-level infestation data and found a 6-month lag between detection of new infestation and dispersal events. The models showed a seasonal increase in bug establishment from May to November, coinciding with an increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new bug establishment increased with time since last infestation. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are necessary to close these gaps.

Discrete and continuous Markov models for site transitions from uninfested to infested and vice versa were fitted to spatiemporal data of T. infans, the vector of Chagas. Both sets showed seasonality in establishment of new sites by T.ans coincident with seasonality in dispersal distance. The study addressed three aspects of T.ans control: establishment rate of new populations as a function of distance from existing populations, mechanisms for seasonality in establishment, and effect of insecticide and previous infestation on rates. A continuous model estimated within-season changes and time-dependent effects of insect spraying, but requires assumptions about sources of dispersers between t and t+1. The contribution of each site to establishment between t and t+1 was estimated by interpolation between number of bugs at site t and t+1.
This study investigated the effects of polyomavirus SV40 (SV40) microRNA on the pathogenesis of viral infections in vivo using Syrian hamsters as a model. Adult hamsters were inoculated with 1×10^7 plaque-forming units of four different SV40 variants and sacrificed at 3-270 days post-infection. All strains established persistent infections with slow clearance, displaying broad tissue tropism in liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain, with liver and kidney containing higher viral loads. Expression of SV40 microRNA was demonstrated in wild-type infected tissues, while micro-negative mutants produced higher DNA loads in liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regions showed modestly higher loads in kidney than simple regions. Early transcripts were detected at higher levels than late in liver and kidney. Infectious virus was infrequently detected, with limited clearance of micro-deficient viruses. Wild-type and micro-negative SV showed similar transformation rates in vitro and tumor induction in vivo. This study identified tissue tropism for SV40 in hamsters and first evidence of expression and function of SV microRNA in vivo. MicroRNA dampened viral loads in infected tissues with simple or complex regions.
This study presents the most comprehensive examination of positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, using high-coverage genome assemblies of eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of the dataset results in improved statistical power, allowing for new lineage and clade-specific tests to be applied. Approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two species showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) according to a likelihood test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of selection on lineages or clades. Identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also for specific functions such as complement immunity and perception. Several pathways were enriched for PSG, suggesting co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis indicated PSG switched multiple times between positive and non-selection, suggesting selection often episodic. Affymrix exon array data showed PSG expressed lower levels and tissue-specific than non-PSGs. Genes expressed in spleen, testes, liver, and breast were enriched PSG, but not brain-specific. This study provides evidence for widespread selection in mammalian evolution and insights into functional implications of selection.
Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes skin and mucosal surfaces, forms persistent infections through surface-associated biofilms. Researchers discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure promoting S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed these fibers have amyloid properties, composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). Mutants unable to produce PS were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix-degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Previous studies associated PS with biofilm disassembly, and data show soluble PS disperse biofilms while polymerized do not. This suggests PS aggregation into amyloid modulates biological role in biofilms. 

The S. aureus biofilm contains polysaccharides and DNA interacting with structural and enzymatic proteins. Under certain conditions, S. aureus produces amyloid fibers contributing to biofilm integrity. Purification analysis revealed several PS of the phenol modulin family present. Fibers share morphological and biophysical characteristics with bacterial amyloids such as curli E. coli, Tas B. subtilis, and F fimbria P. aeruginosa. Biochemical analysis revealed fibr structures composed of PS peptides. Ordered PS aggregation into amyloid abrogates bioactivity ascribed moneric peptides. Findings suggest PS modulate bioassembly using amyloid aggregation as control point activity. This is the first to identify extracellular fibril in S. aureus. Results indicate aggregation amyloid regulates PS activity in bioenvironment. S aure PS found in biofilms fibrils, implicating fibril as means altering activity and function.
Researchers have developed a novel antibody biomarker, Ab3, to monitor the persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing agent of Chagas disease, in infected individuals. Chagas affects over 6 million people in 20 countries, mainly in Latin America. Current methods to monitor parasite persistence, such as serological assays and PCR, have limitations due to low parasitic load in blood. The study aimed to evaluate Ab3 as an indirect method to assess parasite persistence after spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance. A multiplex serology assay of 15 T. cruzi antigens was used to evaluate 165 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. Ab3 showed strong correlation with T. cruzi persistence determined by PCR results. High Ab3 was associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while decline in Ab was observed in BZN-treated patients cleared by PCR. Ab3 is a surrogate biomarker for parasite persistence in chronic and benidazole-treated Chagas. It is hypothesized that Ab3 is induced by incessant immune stimulation by tissue-based parasites undetectable by blood PCR. A simple immunoassay of Ab could monitor infectious status of seropositive patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an arthrogenic alphavirus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain, with chronic musculoskeletal pain persisting in a fraction of patients for months to years after initial infection. To identify cells contributing to pathogenesis during chronic phase, a recombinant CHV expressing Cre recombinase (CH-3-C) was developed. CH-3-C replicated in myoblast and fibroblasts and induced arthritis during acute phase in mice, also inducing chronic disease with persistent RNA and myitis and synovitis similar to wild-type CHV. CH-3-C infection of tdato reporter mice resulted in population of tdato cells persisting at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric profiling revealed tdato cells were predominantly myofib and dermal muscle fibbl. Treatment with antibody against Mra, a defined receptor CHV, reduced td cells in chronic and diminished levels of RNA, implicating td cells as reservoir of chronic RNA. Isolation and cytometry sorting td fibbl from skin and ankle and analysis for RNA revealed td cells harbored persistent CHV at chronic points. CH-3-C and tdato system identifies cells surviving CHV in vivo and enriched persistent CHV RNA, a tool for studying pathogenesis in acute and chronic disease stages.
Recent studies have applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand the multi-dimensional structure of neural activity in the brain. However, it is unclear how these results generalize to larger numbers of neurons and trials, and how they relate to the underlying network structure. This study addresses these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and spiking models that generate irregular activity through balance of excitation and inhibition. Two key outputs of dimension reduction, shared dimension and shared variance, were compared with neuron and trial count. Results showed that networks with clustered connectivity differed, and in vivo recordings were consistent with clustered. Recordings of tens of neurons were sufficient to identify dominant variability that generalizes to larger portions of the network. These findings guide interpretation of dimension reduction in limited neuron and trial and sampling, and relate outputs to underlying structure. 

The study used V1 recordings and spiking models to understand how dimension reduction generalizes to larger neurons and trials, and relates to network structure. Spiking models allowed sampling of neurons and trials, assessing dimension reduction over wide range. This assesses results with limited neurons representative of larger network. Known structure influenced scaling trends. Clustered network had fewer dimensions, but represented large variance. Factor analysis provides nuanced single-trial population characterization. Spontaneous activity in vivo and spiking models were studied. Trends of shared dimension and variance with increasing neurons and trials were analyzed. Spontaneous V1 activity in anesthetized macaques and clustered spiking models were used.
Researchers investigated the role of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa-regulated molecule 2-aminoacetophen (2-AA) in modulating host immune responses during infection. They found that 2-AA treatment prior to infection increased survival rates in mice by 90% compared to 10% in non-treated mice. 2-AA activated key immune pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), nuclear factor (NF-κ), and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuated immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment was characterized by transcriptional regulation of c-J N-terminal (JNK) and NFκ activation, with preserved extracellular regulated kinase (ER)1/2 activation, leading to CA/enhancer protein-β (c/EBβ) activation and c/EBβ-p65 complex formation, preventing NFκ activation.2 dampened inflammatory processes while increasing survival and pathogen persistence, consistent with its ability to signal bacteria switch to chronic infection mode. The study reveals a QS immunomodulatory signal promoting aspects of interking communication, facilitating pathogen persistence while enabling host tolerance. Unlike other QS molecules, 2 minimizes immune activation and increases survival, permitting long-term pathogen presence in vivo. Cytokine profiling suggests 2 pretreatment limits pro-inflammatory activation.
Researchers investigated the origin and evolution of the L1-DT1 gene, a domesticated gene derived from a LINE-1 retroelement, in mammals. They found that L1T1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. L1T1 has evolved under positive selection in primate and mouse, and prosimian L1 has replenished itself with a recent L1 ORF from the prosian genome. This suggests L1 has been recurrently selected for novelty, possibly for a role in genome defense. L1 loss is associated with L extinction in several megab lineages, but not in sigmodine rodents. The study highlights the role of retroelement domestication in mammalian biology and that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in lineages. L1 originated at least 106 million years ago, making it more ancient than well-known domesticated retrogenes syncin and F1. L1 function may parallel known domestic retrogene F1 in defense against its progenitor. In species with active L1 extinct, L1 is lost, suggesting selection for restricting L1 is not the only constraint for L1 retention. L1 retention in mammals may be due to divergent L insertion patterns in genomes.
A highly conserved bacterial protein, RNase Y, plays a crucial role in the processing of the 3' end of 16S rRNA and 70 ribosome quality control in E. coli. However, it is not essential in E. coli, although loss of RNase Y severely sensitizes it to multiple stresses. This study shows that RN Y is an endoribonuclease in Vibrio cholera and crucial for virulence, stress, regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome control, and part of a core set of RNases in representative pathogens. Analysis of rRNA and ribosomes of V. cholera partially depleted for RN Y and other RN associated with 16 rRNA processing demonstrates Y is also crucial for 16 r 3 maturation in V. cholera and impedes subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. Y's importance to V cholera pathogenesis was demonstrated by complete loss of colonization, biofilm formation, reduced toxin production, and altered levels of virulence RNAs of V cholera partially depleted Y. Notably, Y genes of distantly related pathogens complement E. coli Y under stress, showing conservation of Y's activity in regulation. This work provides comprehensive exploration of Y's role in human pathogen, conserved across species in cellular processes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the topological properties of transcription factor networks (TF) and their robustness to genetic and environmental perturbations. Specifically, they focused on assortativity, a measure of the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect, and its impact on phenotypic robustness. Theoretical studies suggest that increased assortativity leads to increased robustness, but this has not been characterized in real-world TF networks. The authors used DNase-seq data to measure assortativity of genome-wide TF in 41 human cell types and found a common signature that confers phenotypic robustness. They determined the contribution of each assortativity component to this robustness. TF models have been engineered with modular structure, a characteristic of biological networks, and findings suggest considering assortativity is informative. Theoretical models with increased assortativity exhibit robustness to cis-regulatory mutations and gene duplication due to reduced subgraph size and path length. In contrast, out-assortativity is less sensitive to hub removal. Computational models study transcriptional dynamics and sensitivity to perturbations. Biological robustness stems from various sources, including degree distribution and autoregulatory subgraphs. Results suggest assort provides additional robustness and human TF share a signature that confers robustness.
Researchers investigated how populations of inhibitory (IN) and excitatory (EX) neurons in the neocortex encode stimulus-related information by recording the activity of up to 74 neurons in anesthetized rat somatosensory barrel cortex using 128-channel multi-electrode arrays. They found that individual IN neurons, classified by distinct extracellular waveforms, discriminated better between 6 stimulus classes than EX neurons in granular and infragran layers. Ensembles of IN cells provided as much information as ensembles of the 20 most informative EX neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests a consortium of IN neurons dominates information conveyed to the neocortex, efficiently processing sensory activity. IN neurons showed higher stimulus-related information than EX counterparts in gran and infrag layers, with sharper temporally-precise responses to stimuli. IN ensembles had lower redundancy compared to EX ensembles of best cells. High stimulus information in IN cells at tested modalities location and frequency indicates barrel interneurons may be sharper than principal neurons to stimuli. Results suggest L4 IN convey more information than L EX due to higher spikes, precision, and lower adaptation.
Researchers in the field of synthetic biology have been working to reprogram living cells to perform new functions for various applications. Initial work focused on transcription factors, but regulatory RNAs have gained attention due to their high programmability. However, functional circuits implemented with RNAs are limited. This study reports the engineering of a fundamental logic unit based on riboregulation to sum two bits of information in molecular concentrations. The designed circuit robustly performs computation in a cell encoding result as fluorescence amplitudes. The system exploits post-transcription control with small RNAs and alloster transcription factors to sense molecular signals. This demonstrates RN can be key players in synthetic biology and paves way for complex RNA-based computers using this circuit as building block.

A genetic adder was engineered in Escheria coli on regulatory RN. Focused on ribg of translation to implement design. A bacterial cell was programmed to sum two bits of information in IPTG and ac signal molecules. The cell reports sum as red fluorescence and carry green fluorescence. A genetic system was engineered exploiting ribg to achieve behavior. RNA has been used to engineer expression robust in vivo due to its versatility and designability at nucleotide level. Mechanisms of control through modulation with non-coding RN or chimer molecules transduce signals.

This circuit differs from previous genetic adds as reporter is not duplicated, making architecture better and scalable. Genetic footprint was reduced using RN compared to circuits with TFs. Designs centered on proteins are limited, especially with propensity and orthogon with host, not easy design de novo.
Researchers have investigated the inhibition of cytidine 5'-nucleotidase II (c-II) by ribonucleotide 5'-monophosphate analogues, which regulate intracellular nucleotide pools by catalyzing dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypine nucleide 5'-monosphates. High levels of c-II are correlated with abnormal outcomes in patients treated with cytotoxic nucleide analogues. To identify its role in resistance during cancer therapy, a class of chemical compounds, ribonucle phosphates, were screened as potential c-II inhibitors. These compounds incorporate a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-car linkage instead of regular phospho bond. Among 34 analogues, six were better ligands than natural c-II substrate inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP). Study of purine and pyrimidine analogues and introduction of modifications in phosphon chain defined rules governing affinity of ligands. Binding was scrutinized in silico and explained by van der Waals contacts, highlighting decisive role of c-II residues Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Dock predictions confirmed by experimental measurements of nucleotase activity in presence of best phosphon analogues, inducing total inhibition of c-II at 2mM. This study emphasizes importance of non-hydroable phosphon bond in design of competitive-II inhibitors and hydrophobic stacking by protein residues.
A recent study has found evidence of prion infectivity in colostrum and milk from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spong encephalopathy (TSE) affecting ruminants, several months prior to clinical onset. Abnormal prion protein (PrP) was detected by immunohistochemistry and PET in lactal ducts and mammary acini. PrSc accumulation was found in ewes harbouring mammary ectopic lymph follicles developed consequent to Maedi lentivirus infection. However, bioassay revealed prion infect was present in milk and colstrum not only from ewes with lymphoproliferative mastitis but also those with lesion-free mammary glands. Milk and colstr infectivity was recovered in cellular, cream, and casein whey fractions. Using a Tg 338 mouse model, the highest infectious titre measured was equivalent to 6g of posterior brain from terminally scrap-affected ewe. These findings indicate colstr and milk from ruminants incubating T could contribute to T transmission, either directly or through milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs, raising concern for human T exposure with ovine and T-susceptible dairy products.
During the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, a total of 16,370 laboratory samples were tested between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015. Of these, 10,536 individuals were traceable, with 3,897 confirmed positive for Ebola RNA. The study found significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola RNA. Young children and elderly and rural residents were at higher risk of death. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. Data collection and management were challenging due to malfunctioning surveillance and reporting systems. However, laboratories were able to systematically register demographic and clinical information of patients. The investigation was part of the public health response in Liberia and not considered human subjects research, as data were not collected for research purposes but for response. Raw data were anonymized, and serial samples identified using raw data.
Researchers have investigated the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, a copper-containing monooxygenase that converts phenol to orthoquinone, in complex with the "cadd" protein, which facilitates copper transport into the active center. The study focused on Tyr98 residue in cadd, accommodated in tyrosase's active pocket, found to be converted to quin through μ2η:2-pero-dopper II and Cu II-dasiquinone intermediates. High-resolution cryo-crystal structures (1.16-1.70 Å) revealed a previously unknown step: CuA movement induces syn-anti rearrangement of copper ligands after μ2:2-pero-dopper II formation, placing hydroxyl group in equatorial position for electrophilic attack by CuO2 oxidant. UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy confirmed quin formation through μ2:2-per-dopper II and Cu II-diquin intermediates. Notably, intermediates after μ2:2-per-dopper II were not trapped with substrate 3,5-difluorophol in S. antibioticus tyin, similar to S. The deoxy form interacts with dopquin more weakly than deoxy due to copper position shift, releasing quin-cadd protein. Crystallography (ST, ST, ST) showed CuA movement to CuA before hydrolysis, with CuA functional but not artifact in product state. A catalytic mechanism proposed: quin separated from deoxy, new substrate enters pocket.
Researchers have investigated the early stages of ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes, specifically the production of the large ribosomal subunit. The first precursor to the large subunit, the pre-60 particle, contains 30 assembly factors (AFs), including the Dbp helicase, which drives conformation rearrangements. However, the mechanisms by which these helicases are targeted to their substrate within pre-ribosomal particles and their precise roles remain unknown. This study demonstrates that the Dbp helase associates with a complex of four AFs, N1, N2, N8, and R3, prior to incorporation into the 90 preribosomal particles. Tandem affinity purifications show N forms the backbone of the complex, and N and N directly bind Dbp. N is essential for insertion of Dbp within 90 preribosomal particles. In vivo cross-linking analysis maps N binding sites on 25 rRNA adjacent to root helices of first and last secondary domains. This suggests N and Dbp function in formation/clustering root helices of subRNAs, creating core of ribosomal structure. N also crosslinks snoRNAs in decoding and peptid transfer center and vicinity of binding sites on 25 r. Data suggest Dbp and N play key roles in compacting core 25 r and controlling sno-preRNA interactions.
Researchers investigated the role of catecholamines in regulating learning rate in a dynamic environment. They found that the P3 component of the EEG, an electrophysiological index of phasic cateolamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction error magnitude on learning. P3 also mediated the effects of unexpectedness of an outcome and uncertainty of existing belief on learning. Pharmacological manipulation of cateolamine activity affected learning following task changes in a way that depended on participants' baseline rate. These findings provide evidence for a causal role of cateolamine systems in learning regulation as a function of environmental change.
Researchers implemented a syndromic surveillance system called EPIC in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases diagnosed by Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories. From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were established in the Salm region of Senegal, and EPIC was implemented to analyze data produced by the Tim hospital laboratory in Marseille, France. The study aimed to describe EPIC's implementation using data from the two POC in Senegal. After EPIC, 15 pathogens were monitored routinely diagnosed in the two POC using the same methodology as in France. In 5 years, 2,577 patient samples from 775 patients were tested in Diel and Ndi POC, with 739 positive for at least one pathogen. Retrospective analysis with EPIC generated 443 alarms. From January 2016, 316 samples from 298 patients were processed in Niak POC, with 56 positive for at least one pathogen. Retrospective analysis with EPIC generated 14 alarms. EPIC was successfully implemented in Senegal using rural P-L data, demonstrating scalability and versatility. Compared to other African surveillance systems, EPIC's main asset is real-time monitoring of 27 tests for 15 pathogens. Further improvements are needed to enhance EPIC.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular architecture in collective signaling and contractility in endothelial cells, specifically in response to histamine stimulation. Using a combination of computational modeling and micro-patterning techniques, they found that endothelial cells in self-assembled networks, but not individual monolayers, exhibit calcium oscillations under histamine stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition and modeling revealed that calcium oscillations depend on the number of neighboring cells via gap junction intercellular communication, providing a mechanistic basis for architecture-dependent signaling. Calcium oscillations also attenuate histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and contraction, resulting in architecture-dependent cell responses. The study suggests endothelial cells sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to vascular architecture via collective signaling. Histamine-induced permeability is confined to venules rather than capillaries, indicating architecture dependence on response. The study used human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HVEC) to explore effects of architecture on histamine signaling. Histamine induced rapid increase followed by slow decay cytosolic concentration in individual cells and monolayers, but oscillations in networks compared to individual and monolayers investigated architecture dependence. Experimental and computational models showed oscillation rate negatively correlated with number of neighboring cells in network. Histamine mediates changes actin cytoskeleton, intercell gap formation, endothelial permeability, and dysfunction through calcium contraction. Computational model provided insights into mechanism of architecture-dependent signaling, with intracellular dynamics sensitive to cytosolic concentration and membrane potential.
Researchers investigated the role of antigenic sites on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) attachment protein outside the conserved cystine domain (CCD) in eliciting immunity and protection against the virus. They used recombinant E. coli-expressed ectomain (REG), CCD-deleted ectomain (REGCCD), and N and C-terminal subdomains, as well as antigenic peptides to evaluate immunogenicity and neutralization efficacy in rabbits and mice. Results showed that REGCC, N, and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound glycosylated recombin mammalian expressed ectomain (RM) and intact RSV particles, but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared to intact ectomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A Line 19, and viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmun controls. Control viral loads post-R challenge correlated with serum binding to particles. Low Th2/Th cytokine ratios were found in lungs of REGCC vaccinated mice after challenge. The study demonstrates presence of multiple protective sites on RSV protein outside CCD contributing to development of bacterially unglycosylated protein as safe vaccine against RSV disease.
Researchers have identified the role of the splicing component b2 (b2) in the specification of Drosophila neuropeideric neurons, specifically the Tv4 neurons in the ventral nerve cord. During embryonic development, Tv neurons receive a signal from their target cells, which triggers the activation of the FMa gene, leading to neuropeptide expression. A genetic screen identified b2 and Pr8, components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, as involved in Tv specification. This study focuses on the role of RNA processing in target-derived signaling and found that b2 and Pr8 play crucial roles in controlling FMa expression in Tv neurons. Analysis of b2 revealed its control is executed through two mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to receive BMP ligand and proper splicing of genes in the BMP pathway, thickins (tk) and Medea. These results show involvement of RNA in diversifying neuronal identity within the nervous system.
Researchers have identified a novel pathway for regulating the abundance of F-box proteins, a crucial components of the SCF ubiquitin ligases, which are a large class of E3 ubiquitin ligases. The SCF ubiquitin ligases are composed of Cul1, Skp, Rbx, and one of multiple F-box proteins, which confer substrate specificity to the complex. The study focused on the 'Sk1-free' F-box degradation pathway of Met30, a substrate for SCFMet ubiquitin ligase, which regulates transcription factor Met by proteolysis-independent ubiqulation. The 'Sk1-free' F-box degradation is essential for Met30 stability. Met instability in sk1 mutants led to the hypothesis that the ubiquitin ligase responsible for degrading '1-free Met may recognize a domain close to the F-box, obstructed by Sk1 binding. The study found that the pathway targets Met detached from Sk1 involves SC core components C53 and R1, as well as cognate SC ubiquitin conjugating enzyme C34. Importantly, this ubiqulation does not require Sk1, suggesting a function of C53/C1 independent of association with Sk1. A novel pathway for F-box regulation, in addition to autoubiqulation, targets F proteins dissociated from Sk1, employs SC core components C53 and R1, and SC ubiquitin conjugating enzyme C34. This pathway is distinct from the canonical Sk-dependent SC ubiqulation. The study assigns biological functions to a subcomplex of Cull-R ligases comprising C53/R1/C34, independent of Sk1. This pathway is critical for chromosome stability and defense against heavy metal stress.
Mammalian Kines-3 motors, specifically KIF1, drive the transport of synaptic vesicles and membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, Kines motors are kept inactive to prevent motility and ATP hydrolysis. Current models suggest KIF1 is monomeric in the inactive state, activation resulting from concentration-driven dimerization on the membrane. However, this study found both native and expressed K1 proteins are dimeric in the inactive state, contradicting the model. Instead, K1 motors are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms, suggesting a model for activation of dimer K1 by cargo binding. Successive truncations result in moneric and dimer motors that undergo one-dimensional diffusion along microtub lattice, but only dimer motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. This indicates K1 may use both diffuse and processive motility for long-distance transport in neuronal cells.

Expressed and endogenous mammalian K1 motors exist in dimer, inactive state, ruling out cargo-induced dimerization. An autoinhibition is supported by identifying sequences and mechanisms for dimer and inhibition. Only dimer motors undergo processive, ATP-driven motility. Dimer K1 motility is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtubes with average velocity comparable to vesicles in vivo. Both moneric and dimer forms undergo 1D on microtubes, indicating nonspecific binding enhancing processivity. Loss of K1 or Unc104 results in decreased vesicles in axonal growth and death, highlighting the importance of kines regulation for transport.
Researchers investigated the regulation of seed metabolism in a collection of 76 tomato introgression lines (ILs) grown in two consecutive seasons using metabolite profiling and network analysis. Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (QTL). Amino acid contents showed high variability across the population with similar patterns in both seasons, while sugars exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Integration of tomato peric metabolite profiling identified the main factor for metabolic polymorphism as genic background rather than environment or tissue. Analysis of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in ILs than M82 cultivar. Heritability suggested mode of metabolite inheritance in seed differed from fruit. Metabolic network analysis comparing seed with fruit showed seed displayed tighter interdependence of processes. Amino acids in seed network played a central role maintaining interactions with other metabolites, sugars, and acids. Six highly regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro, were identified with strong interdependence confirmed by QTL mapping. Results reflect extensive regulation of seed metabolism, coordination with fruit, and centrality of amino acid in seed network.
Vibrio cholera, a bacterial pathogen, colonizes both the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract through its N-acetylucamine protein (Gbp), which mediates attachment to marine chitin and mammalian mucin through an unknown mechanism. Structural studies reveal Gbp possesses an elongated, four-domain structure with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A glycan screen shows Gbp binds GlcNA oligosacides. Structure-guided Gbp truncation mutants show domains 1 and 4 of Gbp interact chitin in vitro, while in vivo studies reveal domain 1 crucial for mucin and intestinal colonization. Bacterial studies show domains 2 and 3 bind V cholera surface. Mouse virulence assays show only first three domains Gbp required for colonization. Gbp's modular structure enables interactions between V cholera, intestinal epithelium, and chinous exoskeleton.
Circulating HLA-DR+CD4 effector T cells resistant to C5 and PD1 mediated suppression compromise regulatory cell function in tuberculosis. Chronic immune activation is a hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not well understood, relying on control of effector T cells by regulatory cells. Studies show that natural regulatory cells in adults with TB preserve suppressive potential, but effector cells from subjects are resistant to regulatory suppression. This is due to expansion of an effector subset identified by Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR expression. Sensitivity to suppression is restored to control levels by depletion of this subset. Transcriptome analysis of eff cells with HLA-DR+ versus the fraction of this population identified putative mechanisms to IFNG, IL-17, IL-22, PD-1, and chemokines CCL3, C4 expression. Antibody experiments confirmed HLA-DR eff cells, not the fraction of HLA-DR, to be resistant regulatory mediated via C5 and PD1 pathways. In presence HLA-DR cells, activation of NF downstream C5 and PD1 was perturbed. Additionally, HLA-DR cells expressed higher levels of Th1/17 cytokines that regulate function through reciprocal-balancing relationship. This study provides insight how activated HLA-DR+CD+ cells contribute to disease by compromising regulatory suppression in TB. Data is consistent with the paradigm that pathology, like chronic infections, is associated immune activation. HLA-DR eff cells resistant to regulatory suppression are a potential marker of disease with implications for monitoring and therapy. C5 and PD are reported to promote suppression; here show their role in eff susceptibility in TB. Data highlights HLA-DR to express levels of Th/17 cytokines that negatively regulate function.
Researchers investigated the propagation of prions in mice lacking a protein called PrP, which is linked to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Mice expressing Pr without GPI (tg- mice) are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate anchorless PrSc, rather than intracellularly. The study found that R and ME prions, but not 22 pr, propagated in tg mice developed novel tropisms, as determined by Cell Assay. Surprisingly, levels of proteinase-resistant PrSc (PrPres) in R- or ME-infected tg mice were 25-50 times higher than wild-type. When returned to wild-type, ME pr recovered original properties, but Rions gave rise to novel strain, S, which remained unchanged after three passages in wild mice. Both R and S are stably propagated in wild mice, suggesting a high energy barrier is abated in tg mice.
In Drosophila, the BMP signaling pathway plays a crucial role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development, mediated by the transcription factor Mad and repressor Brinker. A study combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, researchers deciphered the BMP-responsive transcription network underlying dorsal ectoderm differentiation. Multiple BMP targets, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling, were identified. EGF signaling was found to negatively regulate embryonic BMP transcription, establishing a balance between BMP and antagonistic EGF pathways for correct patterning. Key transcription factors Zelda and Zerknllt were found to establish the expression domain, with insulator proteins binding to Mad and Brinker-bound regions. Analysis of embryos lacking BE-32 insulator showed reduced BMP target gene transcription and amiosa cell fate. A model for Mad-dependent activation was proposed, relevant to BMP interpretation in vertebrates.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major are increasing and spreading from the southwest to new areas in the center. To improve current knowledge on L major evolution and dynamics, multi-locus microsatellite typing of isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic (Gaf, Kairan, and Sidi Bouid) and collected during two periods (199-1992 and 200-2012) was performed. Analysis of genotyping results in Sidi Bouid 199-199 and 200-201 shows that over two decades, Leish parasites evolved generating genetically differentiated populations. The patterns of 200-201 isolates from three governorates indicate L major did not spread from south to center Tunisia according to geographical, suggesting human activities might be source of disease. Genotype analysis suggests Bayesian model and F-stat flows between governor and districts. Human activities, reservoir, and environmental changes explain disease progression. This study provides insights into evolution and spread L in Tunisia, improving understanding parasite between geographically and temporally distinct populations.

Human isolates in three governor 200-201 assessed population dynamics L according geographical and emergence leishias epidemics in populations. Isolates in Sidi Bouid 199- and 200- were compared to provide evolution L populations same area twenty years. Z incidence Leish genetic diversity increasing, assuming Leish adapted environment [7, 8, 48]. Twenty, Tunisia, like world, rapid ecosystem modifications anthropic disturbed sandfly, rodent, impacting Leish population 199. Calculation genetic differentiation L population Sidi and Africa, Asia, East, Iran, Pakistan revealed considerable [20, 19, 50].
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthelmint chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. The study found that deworming with albendazole and prazantel reduced the odds of infection with any helmin species by 89% (OR: 0.11, 95%CI: 0.05,0.20, p<0.001), adjusting for age and sex. Access to safe flooring offered additional protection (OR:0.34,95%:0.20,0.56,p<0.001), but other W conditions had minimal benefit. For schistosiasis, treatment with prazantel was protective (OR:0.30,95:0.14,0.60,p=0.001). Among those not treated with albend or prant, safe flooring (OR:0.34,95:0.20,0.59,p<0.001) and latrine access (OR:0.59,95:0.35,0.99,p=0.05) were protective. There was no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthint chemotherapy and W resources. The study suggests dewing is effective in reducing helmin infections among HIV-infected adults, with W offering minimal additional benefit except for flooring.
A lectin-like bacteriocins, produced by plant-associated bacteria, selectively kill closely related species, including phytopathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthas species, but their mode of action remains unknown. The crystal structure of LlpW, a lectin-like bacterioc from Pseudomon putida, reveals a two monocot mannose-binding lectin (MB) domains and a C-terminal β-hair extension. The C-terminal MB domain adopts a fold similar to MB domains in plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose oligosaccharides. Mutational analysis indicates an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal MB domain adopts the same fold but is structurally divergent and lacks a mannose-binding site. Differential activity of engineered N-domain chimeras from Lp homologs with killing spectra disclosed the N-domain determines specificity. This bacterin is assembled from two structurally similar domains evolved towards dedicated functions in recognition and bacterotoxicity.

The structure of LlpW from P putida assigns it to the MB lectin family, the first prokaryotic representative of a group of proteins with two MB domains. Lp as a bacteridal fits the picture of MB domains in defense. No antibacterial activity has been assigned to eukotic MB proteins, it is challenging to identify features that confer intraspecific bacterioc activity of L, shown in proteins from put, fluoresens, syring, and citri. A defensive role has been proposed for oligo mannose MB lectins based on insectidal, nematic, antifungal, antiv activities for several found in monoc plants. Some trigger apoptosis in cancer cells, identification in mucus and epithelial is with a protective antimicrobial for MB domains.
In the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, the developing spore (forespore) resides within a mother cell and undergoes a coordinated developmental program. The regulation of the forespore transcription factor σG at this stage has remained enigmatic. σG requires eight proteins encoded in the spoII operon and foresore protein SpoQ. Several SpoII proteins share similarity with components of specialized secretion systems, one resembling an ATPase, and we demonstrate that ATP motifs are required for σ activity. The SpoII proteins and SpoQ reside in a multimer complex spanning two membranes surrounding the foresore. We show that these proteins are required to maintain foresore integrity in their absence, the foresore develops invaginates and collapses. Importantly, maintenance of fores integrity does not require σ. These results support a model where SpoII-SpoQ proteins form a novel apparatus allowing the cell to nurture fores, maintaining fores physiology and σ activity during spore maturation. SpoIIA shares similarity with ATPases of type II and IV systems, conserved motifs required for σ and spore formation. Six SpoII proteins in the cell and SpoQ in fores are in a multimer membrane complex spanning double membranes surrounding fores. The SpoIA-SpoQ complex forms a novel apparatus linking cell and fores, cobbled from components in Gram-negative secretion systems. SpoIA resembles ATPases in II and IV systems. SpoQ, SpoIA proteins, and ATP motifs in SpoIA are required to maintain fores integrity. In their absence, fores develops invaginates and collapses. Maintenance of integrity does not require σ, indicating collapse is not a result of failure to activate σ and late program fores expression under its control.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study of bipolar disorder (BD) using data from 1,190 cases and 401 controls, and an additional samples of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. They found no genome-wide significant associations for individual loci, but showed an association between the power to detect effects from a previous genome-wide study and replication (P=1.5×10^-7). To demonstrate this result is not a false positive, they analyzed replication in a meta-analysis of height and showed associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate common variation associated with BD near exons (±10kb) could be identified in larger studies, providing a framework for assessing potential replication combining results from multiple studies.

Bipolar disorder is a major psychiatric disorder affecting 1% of the population, with extreme mood swings between mania and depression, and 17% suicide. It is highly heritable but has not yielded genetic loci from family and population mapping. Multiple genome association studies highlighted candidates without genome significance. The study considered results of an association involving 1,190 newly genotyped BD from the Bip Genome Study and 401 controls, referred as 'T' samples. These were collected through same mechanisms 1,001 and 1,033 of European ancestry genotyped through the initiative.

In this, the relationship between power to detect SNP based association observed one study and replication another was assessed. This in a way for assessment of collections SN in genomic regions to test hypotheses of variation mediating susceptibility. Additionally, in context data, specific variants tested stronger associations power and replication. This strategy applied to new GWAS to identify signals circums regions genome not captured single analyses at genome levels. The consistency at loci across studies by power detect effect in "discovery and comparing to associations "test"
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify predictive proliferation signatures of cancerous and non-cancerous cells by quantifying the association between gene expression levels and growth rates across 60 cancer cell lines. They assigned a Cancer Prolation Index (cPI) to each gene and found that essential cancer genes in knockdown screens exhibited positive PI values, while tumor suppressors showed negative PI. Processes related to cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production were positively associated with cancer, while migration was negatively associated. Analysis of non-cancer proliferation indices across lymphoblast cell lines revealed differences between cancerous and nonancer proliferation, highlighting translation and splice machineries as cancer-associated proteins. A cross-species comparison showed cancer proliferation resembled microorganisms while nonancer did not. Combining cancer and nonancer signatures predicted patient outcome and geneity in cancer. The study points to inherent differences between cancerous and nonancer determinants, contributing to future cancer-specific anti-prolative drug development.
A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and endovascular cistic echinoccosis (CE) was followed over a period of 15 years (1995-2009). Clinical manifestations included thoracic pain and dyspnea, although 2 patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients were previously diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echography was the diagnostic method of choice, although serology, electrocardiogram, chest-ray, computed tomography/magnetic imaging and histology aided diagnosis and follow-up. Nine underwent cardiac surgery and received long-term antiparas treatment for median 25 months (4-93). One died intraoperatively due to cyst rupture and endascular dissemination. Two died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism (PE) and cardiac failure respectively. One was lost to follow. Patients with cardiac involvement did not have complications after surgery and were considered cured. There was one recurrence requiring second operation. With vena involvement developed PE and presented multiple complications. Cardiovascular CE associated with high risk potentially lethal complications. Manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location. Isolated cardiac may be cured surgery while endovascular extrard involvement associated severe complications.
Researchers investigated the role of Tir, a Staphylococcus aureus Toll/interleukin receptor (TLR) mimic, in modulating virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility. They found that ectopic expression of Tir in eukotic cells inhibited TLR signaling, downregulating NFkB through inhibition of TLR2, T4, T5, and T9. In a mouse model of S. aureus skin infection, lesions induced by the S. aureus tir mutant increased compared to wild-type strains, despite similar bacterial loads. Tir was associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity, confirming its role in virulence attenuation through inflammatory responses. Tir localized within the S. aureus chromosomal cassette (SCC) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance, but not the mec gene. Sub-inhibitory fusidic acid increased Tir expression. Epidemiological studies found no link between Tir and clinical presentation, but a selective advantage with SCCmec element SCC/tir. Two traits determining S. aureus success and spread are linked.
Researchers analyzed gene expression data from fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and mosquito (Anopheles gambia) embryos to identify differences in embryonic patterning mechanisms. They found that 75% of orthologous gene pairs have similar temporal expression profiles, but 25% exhibit discordances. Clustering based on these discordances revealed a group of genes involved in mosquito serosa formation, which is redeployed later in cuticle synthesis. A subset of maternal genes showed sharp reduction in expression at maternal-zyotic transition in Dophila, but sustained in Anophe. This suggests gene clustering by temporal discord can identify batteries underlying morphological diversity. The study provides a framework for cross-species comparisons of transcriptional data, revealing distinctive patterning properties in Diptera embryos, including extraembryonic tissues and maternalzyotic transition.
Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study in rural villages of Lih Island, Papua New Guinea to investigate the presence of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp perten DNA in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and environmental surfaces during a yaws elimination campaign. Participants were recruited from households with and without cases of ulcers. Swabs were taken from the skin of asymptomatic individuals, flies, and environmental surfaces, and tested by PCR for H. duyi and T. pertue DNA. Of 78 asymptomatic participants, 21% had H. duyi PCR positivity and 1% T. pertue positivity. In subgroup analysis, H. duyi positivity did not differ between exposed or not exposed to a case in the household. Of 17 cultures from asymptomatic, 12 yielded definitive H. duyi diagnosis. Of 10 flies, 90 had H. duyi and 50 T. pertue DNA. Of 6 bed sheets, 33 had H duyi and 17 T. pertue DNA. This is the first demonstration of H duyi on asymptomatic skin and H du and T.ue in flies and fites. Ubiquity of H du in environment contributes to spread.

The study aimed to demonstrate presence of viable H du in children, examine contacts of ulcer carriers, and identify environmental sources. PCR showed 20% asymptomatic children had H duyi on skin, no symptoms or signs of infection. People from households with and without ulcer had similar positivity rates. PCR-positive were more likely to change lin less than once a week. 10 flies outside houses with ulcers had 90 H duyi and 50 T.ue DNA. 2 flies had H du by standard and 21 replicates real-time PCR. Household visits for 21 patients with ulcers, 57 had H du and 5 Tue in ulcers, neither in 38. Of 7 ulcers, 29 yielded no growth and 71 small rods. Of 17 asymptomatic, 47 yielded no growth and 53 small rods. 6 tested, 2 were H du. By exposure, 24% of asympt exposed and 18% not exposed H du were du positive.
The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training and curricula across various user groups and programs. The competencies were based on surveys of employers and training programs, refined through a multi-year community engagement process. This report describes the current competencies and presents use cases illustrating their application in diverse training contexts. The competencies aim to assist educators by providing a conceptual framework for sharing experiences and best practices in bioinformatics education, addressing divergent needs and expectations.

The competencies were refined and applied in various bioinformatics and training programs globally. To illustrate their use, brief cases are presented, highlighting diverse training needs, user types, programs, and settings. A bioinformatics users require a basic understanding of methods and stronger interpretation of outputs. The ISCB Committee described potential refinement and application of competencies for different groups. The cases demonstrate the core competencies provide a basis for bioinformatics educators, despite divergent goals and populations, to share experiences designing, refining, and evaluating training. The competencies are not a prescription for specific curricula or standards.
Researchers conducted a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenyl transcriptome of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercalis to investigate the mechanisms of its developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3) formation. The study aimed to determine if homologous pathways present in Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nemode with a similar developmentally arrested larval form, the dauer, are involved in L3 arrest and activation. The study generated 2.3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages and constructed expression profiles for S. steralis homologs of C. elegans dauer genes. Intriguingly, genes encoding cyclic GMP pathway components were coordinately upregulated in L3. In contrast to C. elegans, S. steral has a paucity of genes encoding insulin/IG-1 signaling ligands, several of which have abundance profiles suggesting involvement in L3 development. Seven S. steral genes encoding homologs of C. elegans dauer TGF ligand were identified, three of which are expressed only in L3. Putative biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3 development. The data suggest that dauer pathways are present in S. steral and may play a role in L3 development, with significant differences between the two species.
Researchers investigated the effects of two bacterial toxins, Cytothal distending toxin (CDT) and colibactin, secreted by pathogenic bacteria, on nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival. They used Helicobacter-infected mice, coculture with CD and colibin-secreting bacteria, hepatic and intestinal cells, and xenograft mouse models to assess nuclear remodeling in vitro and in vivo. Results showed CD and colibin induced nuclear remodeling associated with formation of cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus, corresponding to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The NR core concentrated ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and main components of complex CR involved in mRNA turnover. These structures were active sites of translation, correlated with high ploidy, and MAP and calcium signaling. Data showed insulation and concentration of ribonucleoproteins within nucleus were dynamic, transient, and protected cells until genotoxic stress relieved. Bacterial genotoxin-induced NR was a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation. Findings offered insights into NR formation, a feature of many cancers, not only in response to DNA damage but also in response to genotoxic bacteria.
Researchers evaluated maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy using three-dimensional computed tomography (3-CT). Ten patients with lepro and five controls underwent CT scans, and three-dimensional images of the maxilla were reconstructed using multiplan methods. The anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA) was measured and compared between patients and controls after compensating for individual skull size. Results showed marked atrophy of the maxilla in three patients, consistent with visual deformity and paleopathological findings. The study confirmed maxillary regression described in paleopathological studies. Three-dimensional CT enabled precise calculation of bone defects for reconstructive surgery. The method illustrated maxillary deformities in living patients with lepro. 

The study reconstructed CT images of maxillary bone in patients with lepro and controls using volume rendering and multiplan methods. Findings were compared with maxillary deformities in paleopathological studies. The technology was applied to evaluate maxillary deformities qualitatively and quantitatively. Stereoscopic 3-CT enabled easier evaluation as images could be observed in any direction. Results showed nasal and alveolar process deformed in four of ten patients. Max lesions in excavated lepro skeletons were described as facies lepro by Moller-Christensen and rhinax syndrome by Andersen et al. DNA M lepr was identified in these bones. 

The difference between MA and MA indicated atrophied maxilla thickness, corresponding to bone prosthesis needed for reconstruct. Method may be tool for max defects caused by lepro. Caution in study was small sample sizes lepro and controls. Further analysis larger samples needed methodology 3-CT promising evaluation maxillary associated le and other lesions.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system constructs noise-invariant representations of sounds in the presence of background noise by examining adaptation to stimulus statistics along the auditory pathway. They measured neuronal responses to complex and natural sounds in the inferior colliculus and primary auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets and compared them with a model of the auditory nerve. The strength of adaptation to mean and contrast increased as the pathway ascends. To determine if adaptation contributes to noise-invariant representations, complex sounds were embedded in stationary noise and a decoding approach was used to assess the tolerance of the population. The code for complex sounds in the periphery was more affected by noise than the cortical. Noise tolerance was correlated with adaptation to statistics, with populations showing strongest adaptation also being most tolerant. The increase in adaptation from nerve to cortex is a stage in constructing noise-invariant representations in higher brain.

The study found a progressive increase in noise tolerance of sound representations through the pathway. Neuron-level and population changes in adaptation and noise tolerance were correlated within and across centers, suggesting adaptation to statistics drives noise-toler representations. Responses became more independent of background noise through the pathway. The coding of neurons was affected by changes in statistics induced by noise, with an increase in adaptation strength along the pathway. By the cortex, populations represented in a noiseoler fashion, responding to common features between clean and noisy conditions. Adaptation to statistics increased along the pathway, accounting for background effects on complex sounds. Populations shifted from low-level attributes to mean- and noise-independent information about stimulus, a step towards context-invariant representations in higher areas.
Researchers investigated the impact of heat shock on the yeast protein-protein interaction network (interactome) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-characterized model organism. They analyzed changes in interaction weights of the interactome from mRNA levels upon heat shock and found a significant decrease in overlaps and connections between modules. The diameter of the interactome increased 4.9-fold in heat. Key proteins of the heat response became centers of heat-induced communities and provided residual connections after shock. The changes resembled a'stratus-culus' transition, from a globally connected to multifocal structure. Heat induced partial disintegration of the interact's global organization. This may occur in other stresses and complex systems, such as proteins, social networks, and ecosystems. The study provides a system-level adaptation mechanism to environmental changes. 

The interactomes had different structures due to mRNA patterns upon heat. The median interaction weight decreased 14% in heat cells. The interact weights were calculated from protein-protein subset of BioGRID, combining literature and direct interactions. No direct PPI data exist for shocked cells, so mRNA data was used. Heat is a severe stress with coupled transcription and translation changes. Protein levels are regulated by degradation. The disintegration is not an obvious consequence of mRNA changes but a system-level adaptation. The finding appeared at multiple network levels. 

Bridges, intermodular proteins connected modules after shock were studied. Centrality values of proteins before and after heat showed different behaviors.
A systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of amiodarone in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, a chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi prevalent in Latin America. Nine studies, including 3 before-and-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized trial, were included, with 2 providing full datasets for individual patient-level analysis. Amiodarone reduced ventricular tachia episodes by 99.9% (95%CI 99.8-100%), ventricular beats by 93.1 (95%CI82.4-97.4), and ventricular couplets by 79% (RR 0.21, 95CI 0.11-0.39). Adverse effects associated with amarone included corne microdepos 61.1 (95CI 19.0-91.5), gastrointestinal 16.1 (CI 6.6-34.2), bradycard 12.7 (CI 3.7-35.6), dermatological 10.6 (CI 4.7-21.9), and discontinuation 7.68 (CI 4-13.7). Quality of evidence ranged from moderate to low. Amiodone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias but lacks evidence for endpoints sudden death and hospitalization.
A study examined the seasonal patterns of deng fever in rural Ecuador from 2009-2016 using data from two hospitals. Poisson generalized modeling was used to determine short and long-term patterns of deng fever, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays. A subset analysis determined the impact of school schedules on school-aged children, and a separate model examined the effect of climate on diagnosis. The most important predictors of deng fever were annual fluctuations in disease, long-term trends, day of the week, and hospital. Seasonal trends showed peaks in diagnoses during mid-March. Cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors except for an increase on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact deng diagnoses in school children. Climate variables included total precipitation, interaction between precipitation and minimum temperature, interaction between precipitation and days, and a three-way interaction between temperature, precipitation, and days. This is the first report of long-term deng seasonality in Ecuador, one of few from patients, and one of few utilizing daily reports. Results inform local prevention, health planning, and global models of deng trends.
Researchers have discovered a novel way to activate the innate immune system to provide broad-spectrum antiv protection against emerging and re-emerging diseases without requiring antigen-specific recognition or prior knowledge of the causative agent. They found that transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in the absence of other viral proteins can reconfigure mammalian innate immunity by exposing membrane-sequestered Rd activity to sustained immune detection. Rd-transgenic mice showed a life-long, quantitative upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and profound resistance to lethal viral challenge. The mechanism operates via MDA and MAVS and is independent of the adaptive immune system. Human models recapitulated key features with fidelity, inducing an IS network and block to HIV-1 infection. Rd-mediated antiral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within Rd mRNA but operates at the protein level and requires Rd catalysis. Importantly, despite massive IS elevations, Rd mice are entirely healthy with normal longevity. The results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiv protection. Rd mice possess a maximally upregulated innate transcriptome capable of effecting robust antiral response, exceeding immune inductions by infection. Activation of cell-intrinsic immunity culminates production of type I interferons and antiral factors ISGs. Viruses isolate Rd activity during replication. Rd-transgenic mice show reduced viral loads and survive lethal challenge. Rd-induced upulation of innate effectors confers marked resistance to infection. Key steps in antiral sensing were characterized, showing MDA knockout blocks Rd-induced IS activation and compromised survival.
Researchers tested the independent-action hypothesis (IAH) for a plant virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), which states that each virion has a probability of infection and virions act independently during the infection process. They found that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency (<2%). The probability of a genotype infecting the inoculated leaf systemically infecting the plant was near 1, although rare genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by other genotypes. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection was predicted by the independent model. Independent action appears to hold for TE, and Ne is dose-dependent for this RNA virus. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose dependency in TE suggests Ne estimates for different viruses are not meaningful unless dose effects are considered.
Researchers have developed a new statistical approach to study the genetic control of gene expression using a multi-tissue approach. Traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies have been conducted in single tissues or cell types, ignoring shared information across tissues. However, analyzing RNA expression in multiple tissues is now feasible, but few integrated frameworks for joint analysis of expression across tissues with genetic variants have been developed. The proposed Bayesian model, Sparse Regression, maps eQTL within and across tissues simultaneously. Testing on 2,000 genes in four tissues, the method is more powerful than traditional approaches in revealing the eQ landscape at the system level. A two-eQ model (cis/trans) for the Hopx gene was experimentally validated and not detected by conventional methods. Common regulation of expression across tissues was found for 27% of transcripts, providing a 5-fold increase in eQ detection compared to single analyses at 5% FDR. This approach provides new insights into complex regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression and is adaptable to other systems and humans, applicable to multiple and whole-body phenotypes.

The proposed method, Sparse Regression with Evolutionary Stochastic Search (ESS), outperforms other eQ methods within and across tissues. It uncovers polygenic regulation of expression and identifies more trans-eQs than traditional methods. Global expression analysis in multiple tissues is now feasible, but few methods address joint analysis across tissues and genetic points. Statistical Q analyses have followed sparse regression for the large, small paradigm. The implemented multi-locus strategy identifies more cis and trans-effects than single markerQ methods at the same FDR and permits regulation across tissue types.

A Bayesian variable selection for multivariate mapping is implemented and applied to cis and trans-regulation at individual and across tissues. The approach provides a list of eQs and addresses uncertainty in finding predictors. The marginal role of each marker is assessed by averaging supported models to explain variability.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, a process of programmed cell death triggered by external signals such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TRAIL. The model, based on mass-action representation of reaction pathways, accurately reproduces behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, allowing for detailed study of switching mechanisms. Analysis and experiments show that duration of delay before effector caspase activation is determined by initiator casp-8 activity and rates of reactions downstream of TR receptor. Sudden effector casase activation is achieved by membrane permeabilization and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. Interactions among Bcl-2 family, Sm partition from XIAP, and pore assembly mechanics are critical for snap control. A variety of models of apoptotic death have been published, mostly based on differential equations, incorporating mechanisms for all-or-none casase activation. Studies at single-cell level reveal variable delay to effector casase activation and rapid progression to cleavage. The model suggests parameter values are order-of-magnitude estimates. Dynamics of initiator and effector casase cleavage raise question where extrinsic pathway steady increase is converted to snap signal. Activation of effector caspases, hallmark of apoptosis, is triggered by intracellular events or extracellular stimuli.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes breaches the placental barrier during pregnancy, which protects the fetus from maternal immune responses and pathogens. They identified the protein Internalin P (InP) as a secreted virulence factor critical for placental infection and found it binds to human afadin, a protein associated with cell junctions. The crystal structure of InP revealed a unique features, including an extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a Ca2+-binding site. Despite af's involvement in cell junction formation, MDCK cells expressing InP showed decreased traction on substrates, similar to AF-6 knockout cells. L monocogenes ΔInP mutants were deficient in actin protrusions from polarized epithelial monolayers, necessary for transcytosis. A similar phenotype was observed in bacteria with an in-frame InP deletion (InPΔRR) that disrupts interaction with af. However, af deletion in host cells did not rescue transcy defect. They conclude that secreted In targets cytosolic af to promote monoces transcyosis across basal epitholayers, contributing to crossing the membrane during placental infection.
Researchers characterized the proteome of Treponema pallidum s. pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, using mass spectrometry techniques. A total of 603 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the T. pallum proteome to date. The study used multidimensional separation and identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TO) and electrospray ionization (ESI-LT-Orbit) tandem spectrometry on T. pallum s. pallum DAL-1 strain isolated from rabbits. Detected proteins were characterized by predicted function and localization, with half allocated to various categories. Proteins with unclear annotations were subjected to bioinformatics analysis. 116 potential membrane proteins were identified, 16 with evidence of outer membrane localization. 12 proteins related to the paralog tpr gene family were found. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free counting. A low correlation was found between microarray data and protein abundance.
Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes. AMP binds to two tandem AMP-binding domains (CBD-A and B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). The CBD-A in PKα is required for PK inhibition and activation, while CBD functions as a "gate" domain that modulates control exerted by CBD. Preliminary evidence suggests CBD dynamics are critical for gate function. To test this hypothesis, Nuclear Magnetic Reson (NMR) was used on two-domain construct RIα (91-379) in apo, c2, and C-bound forms. Comparative NMR analyses led to a conformation selection model where each CBD samples both active and inactive states independently of adjacent CBD within a degenerate free landscape. Degener is critical to explain sensitivity of CBD to interactions and high affinity for AMP. Binding AMP eliminates degener, stabilizing active conformation within CBD and inter-C contacts requiring AMP W260, mediated by CBD and capping AMP to CBD-A. Inter-C interface is dispensable for intra-C conformation selection but indispensable for PK activation as occluding subunit sites CBD-A. Structurally homolog c-bound CBD exhibit differences in dynamics, supporting conservation of structure does not imply dynamics.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (IS15) in macrophages following vaccinia virus (VAC) infection. They compared the proteomes of IS15- and IS+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMD) treated with interferon (IF) and found that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation (OPHOS) pathways were altered in IS- MD. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were higher in IS+ MD than IS- MD following IF treatment, indicating IS-dependent mechanisms. IS depletion led to a change in macrophage polarization, with IS- macrophages showing a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern typical of M1, but blocked nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase activation. Following IF treatment, NO release was higher in IS+ macroages than IS- macroages, concomitant with a decrease in viral titer. IS- macroages were permissive for VV replication following IF treatment. The study demonstrates that IS governs the functionality of mitochondria, specifically OPH and mitagy, broadening its role as an antiviral agent.
The HIV-1 Vpu protein plays a crucial role in viral replication by degrading the cellular CD4 receptor and enhancing viral particle release. Vpu binds to CD4 and recruits the βTr subunit of the SCβCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its constitutively phosphorylated DS52XX56 motif. However, V escapes degradation by inhibiting the degradation of βTr targets such as β-caten and Iκα. This study investigated V's inhibitory function on Em1 and C25, βTr substrates involved in cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation of V at serine 61, adjacent to the βTr-binding motif, triggers V degradation by a βTr-independent process. Mutation of V61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the protein's half-life and increases HIV-1 particle release from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant is conserved in HIV-1 isolates. Results show differential phosphorylation of V determines its fate as adaptor or substrate of ubiquitin ligases. Conservation of V degradation, despite negative effect on virion release, suggests a role in HIV fitness.
Researchers investigated how tissue patterning in the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae is coordinated with whole-body development to ensure robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations. They proposed two hypotheses: pattering is tightly coordinated with whole development over time or at developmental milestones. A staging scheme was developed for the wing discs using expression of patter genes, linked to whole-body events: moulting, larval, and pupation. The progression of pattern showed alignment at moul and pupation, indicating these events represent milestones. Between milestones, pattern showed variability in response to temperature and physiological changes. Data showed discs from wandering larvae had greater variability in patter stage, suggesting wandering is not a developmental milestone. Patterning remains robust against perturbations by aligning at milestones. The study provides insight into how individual tissue development is coordinated with the body as a whole.
In highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae, endosomes function in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the crosstalk between these processes is scarce. This study demonstrates that the ESCRT regulator Did coordinates endosomal transport in fungal hypha of Ustago may. Loss of Did results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. The late endosomal Rab7 and vacuolar protease P1 exhibit increased shuttling on aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach, explaining disturbed processive movement. The endosomal RNP linker Up1 is absent on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. The ESC regulator Did coordinates endosomal maturation and provides correct identity for efficient endosomal long transport. Endosomal maturation and fusion with vacuoles depend on functional ESC machinery for vacolar sorting. In Did absence, late Rab and P1 shuttle intensively on early end, a phenomenon rarely seen in wildtype hypha. A link between ESC complex and endosomal transport is discovered, indirect, affecting mRN loading on endosomes. Endosomal maturation is crucial for endytic recycling in polar cells. Components for maturation, such as ESC and GTPases, are present early on long trafficking. Did is essential for endytic functions, vacolar cargo sorting, and efficient long transport. Loss reduces end localization and processivity. In addition to vacolar trafficking, Did determines early end identity in polar cells, guaranteeing correct long transport of mRN and septins.
Researchers conducted a comparative study on two adenine-binding riboswitches from Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulificus, which regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. The study revealed differences in ligand binding properties and regulatory mechanisms between the two ribwitches. The Bacillus subtil ribwitch depends on co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, whereas Vibrio ribwitch can bind adenine after transcription is completed and still regulate translation. Investigation showed that transcription rate is critical for Bacillus ribwitch to perform efficiently, consistent with co-transcription regulation. In contrast, Vibrio ribwitch operates under a thermodynamic regime, where ligand binding and regulation occur post-transcription, and transcription-translation is not required for efficient control. A kinetic regime is proposed for Bacillus ribwitch that needs to fold and bind adenine co-transcription to activate transcription. The study also found that when Bacillus ribwitch is transcribed before translation, transcription and translation are uncoupled, addition of adenine increases protein expression by 3-fold. Using ON and OFF ribwitch mutants, it was demonstrated that ribwitch conformations are responsible for aden-dependent modulation of translation. The results suggest that the nature of gene control, transcription or translation, has importance in ribwitch mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a conserved pattern of primer-dependent transcription initiation (PDI) in Escheria coli and Vibrio cholera using high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends (5 RNA-seq). PDI is a process where a 2-4 nucleotide oligonucleotide primer is used to initiate transcription, and has been shown to be prevalent in genes expressed during stationary phase in E coli. coli. The study reveals a physiological role for P in E coli as a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation and demonstrates its occurrence in the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholera. A comparative analysis of P in V cholera and E coli shows a strikingly similar pattern, with P detected in stationary phase, not exponential phase, and preferentially at promoters with T-1+1 or G-1+ sites. RNA-seq and primer analyses indicate P from T-1+ and G+1 sites produces transcripts from position -1. P is also detected in the pathogenic Gammapobacteria Vibrio cholera, with a similar pattern to E coli. coli. This suggests a role for P as a regulatory mechanism modulating biofilm in E coli. The study proposes a growth-dependent process leading to preferential generation of dinucleotides 5'-UA-3 and 5'-GG- in both E coli and V cholera.
Researchers investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, specifically FERTIZATION INDEPENDENT SE2 (FIS) and FLOWERING WINGEN (FWA) controlled by DNA methylation, and MEA (MEA) and PES (P1) by histone methylation. They found that genome imbalance deregulated the expression of IS and P in an antagonistic manner, with increased dosage of inactive alleles causing loss of imprinting of IS and ME. Although IS controls histone methylation which represses ME and P expression, changes of P and ME could not be fully accounted for by fluctuations of IS expression. The study shows parental genome imbalance deregulates imprinting mechanisms independent of known regulators. The complexity of regulations between expressed and silenced imprinted genes in response to parental imbalance does not support simple models from the conflict hypothesis.
Researchers have used mathematical techniques to reverse-engineer brain networks that mimic the dynamics of electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, which exhibit oscillations of specific frequencies over a non-oscillatory background. These oscillations appear as frequency bands evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale, preventing mutual entrainment and cross-talk. The study aimed to investigate what brain rhythms reveal about functional connectivity, rather than how they emerge or are necessary for neural function. Networks were reconstructed to generate dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves, showing similar topological features and dynamics. Diseased brains (epileptic and schizophrenic) were also reverse-engineered, displaying altered oscillatory activity and connectivity. Complexity, quantified by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, was a good indicator of brain fitness, with diseased brains showing lower complexity. The study suggests that brain rhythms convey information about functional connectivity, not anatomy, and has implications for neurobiology and disease.
Researchers conducted a population structure analysis of 1,374 Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) using 60,000 SNPs selected for linkage disequilibrium. The study identified four subgroups within the Hispanic cohort, aligning with self-identification labels: Dominican/Cuban, Mexican/Central American, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican. The analysis used principal components (PCs) of ancestry from Hap phase and Human Diversity Panel (HGDP) to quantify Caucasian, African, and Native American origins. The third and fourth PCs revealed an axis aligning with South-to-N geographic location of HGDP Native samples, separating MESA Mexican from Central/South American samples. The study demonstrated the importance of considering population structure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic studies of the US Hispanic population. A pooled and stratified analysis of triglycerides for SNPs in LPL and TR1 genes showed significant association, previously reported in Caucasians but unconfirmed in Hispanics.
The Elong complex, a histone acetylase, interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to modulate transcriptional silencing and sensitivity to DNA damage. Cells lacking Elp, the catalytic subunit of the six-subunit Elong complex, partially lose silencing of genes at the chromosome VI telomere and HMR locus and are sensitive to DNA inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) and damaging agent methylmethanesulfate (MS). Deletion of Elp or mutations in other El complex subunits compromise silencing and HU sensitivity. Elp is required for S-phase progression in HU. Epasis analysis indicates elp mutant exacerbates MS sensitivity cells lacking histone chaperone As1, C-1 and H lysine acetylase R109. Elp interacts with PCNA in vivo and in vitro. Results uncover novel role Elong complex in transcription silencing and genome stability, linked to replication and repair PCNA.
Researchers have developed a machine-assisted triage method to improve the process of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications, which is essential for building accurate and organized knowledge bases. The traditional query-based method of retrieving relevant publications from PubMed often yields unsatisfactory results and is difficult to generate optimal queries. The proposed method uses deep learning-based convolutional neural networks to classify and rank new publications for curation, trained on a gold-standard dataset from UniProt/SwissProt and NHRIEB GWAS Catalog. Evaluation on real-world curation of UniProt/SissProt and GW Catalog shows the machine-assisted method outperforms query-based methods, improving efficiency and enriching content. It achieves 1.81 and 2.99 times higher precision than query-based methods for UniProt/Siss and GW Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. The method retrieves additional publications query-based UniProt/Siss could not find. This demonstrates machine-based triage makes the process more efficient, allowing curators to focus on challenging tasks to improve knowledge bases.
A gain-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels underlie variant 3 (SQT3) of the short QT syndrome, which is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study investigated the mechanistic link between QT3 mutations and atrial arrhythmogenesis using physiologically detailed human atrial computer models. A model of the human atrial action potential (AP) was modified to recapitulate functional changes in IK due to heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172 and E299 Kir2.1 mutations. Wild-type (WT) and mutant formulations were incorporated into multi-scale and heterogeneous tissue models. Effects on AP duration (AP), conduction (CV), refractory period (ERP), tissue excitation threshold, and rate dependence, as well as the wavelength of re-entry (WL) were quantified. The D172 and E299 Kir.1 mutations produced distinct effects on IK and AP shortening. Both mutations decreased WL through a reduction in ERP and CV. Stability of reentrant excitation in 2D and 3 tissue was mediated by changes to tissueability and AP in conditions. Combined block of IK and IK was effective in terminating re associated with heterozygous D172, whereas IK block alone may be safer for E299. Combined of IK and IK produced a synergistic antiarrhythmic in both forms of QT3. This study provides mechanistic insights into atrial prohythm with QT2.1 mutations and highlights pharmacological strategies for management of QT-linked AF.
Researchers investigated whether adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) could alter the course of Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), in a mouse model of chagasic cardiopathy. ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and tracked by bioluminescence, showing they remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days and most migrated to abdominal subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC injection significantly reduced parasitemia, followed by decreased cardiac inflammation and parasitism at 30 dpi. Cytokine analysis revealed an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals, while splenocytes exposed to T. cruzi antigens produced a pro-inflammatory response, important for parasite control in placebo and ASC-treated groups. However, splenocytes from ASC released higher levels of IL-10 at 60 dpi. Magnetic resonance imaging showed right ventricular (RV) dilation prevented in ASC-treated mice. Injection of ASC after T. cruz infection prevented RV remodeling through modulation of immune response, promoting parasite control and heart protection from damage.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of structurally optimized analogs of Retro-2, a retrograde trafficking inhibitor, in limiting Leishmania infections. Leishmania parasites reside in parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs) within mammalian cells. Previous studies showed that Retro-2 reduced LP sizes and parasite numbers during Leish infections. This study aimed to determine if analogs of Retro-2 with superior potency in inhibiting retrograde-dependent phenomena also controlled Leish infections. Two analogs, DHZ36 and DHZ36.1, showed lower EC50 values (13.63+/-2.58μM and 10.57/-2.66M) than Retro-2 (40.15M) in limiting Leish infections in macrophages. Additionally, they caused reversal of Leish-induced IL-6 suppression by infected cells. Unlike Retro-2, analogs killed Leish parasites in axenic cultures, a desirable trait for treating Leish infections. Studies validated and extended the structure-activity relationship of Retro-2. The analogs were non-toxic to mammalian cells, suggesting the retrograde pathway is more sensitive in Leish. DHZ36 and DHZ36.1 were more efficacious than Retro-2 in suppressing Leish infections, corroborating SAR and proposed mode of action. Consistent with trafficking importance of vesicles in Leish infections, retrograde inhibitor Retro-2 suppressed Leish macrophage infections.
Researchers have developed a computational method to evaluate the sensitivity of nucleosomes to transcription factors across the genome. They found that factors with binding sites within nucleosome boundaries and lacking 10 bp periodicity are sensitive. Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 (AML-1), a regulator of immune gene expression, was identified as sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the Ly49 gene family. This was confirmed in a cell line with natural expression of Ly49 using MNase-Seq to generate a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where Ly49 is located. Analysis revealed specific depletion of nucleosomes at AML-1 binding in expressed LyA compared to silent Ly genes. The study suggests nucleosome regulation contributes to Ly gene expression and proposes the method predicting nucle sensitivity could aid in dissecting regulatory role of nucleosomes. Whole-chromosome analysis of nucle-transcription interactions revealed many factors display nucle coverage and lack 10 periodicity, identifying AML-1 as sensitive in Ly cluster. Predictions were confirmed in cell expressing Ly genes showing preferential nucle depletion at AML-1 sites compared inactive genes. It is of interest to study AML-1 sensitivity at non-Ly genes to determine if ubiquitously sensitive or selected for Ly regulation. In cell naturally expressing Ly, AML-1 sites are depleted nucleosomes throughout promoter/enhancer expressed Ly genes compared unexpressed, implicating nucle positioning mechanism affecting Ly in vivo.
Researchers investigated the regulation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) CD4 and CD6, which are crucial for cell cycle progression and genome duplication. CD activation depends on phosphorylation of their T-loop by CD-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, only known CA for CD2 and CD1 is cyclin-HCD7, which is constitutively active. The critical step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by C25 phosphatases rather than T-loop phosphorylation. Unlike CD1 and CD2 cyclin complexes, CD4 and CD6 bound to cyclins are integrators of mitogenic signaling cascades by inactivating central suppressor pR and cycle at restriction point. The study identified T-loop phosphorylation at172 as highly regulated determining CD4 activity. CD7 inhibition prevented phosphorylation of CD6, but CD4 was partly dependent on p21 binding. In response to CD7 inhibition, p21 binding to CD increased with disappearance of phosphorylation at130, catalyzed by CD4 and CD2. S130 mutation prevented CD4 phosphorylation and inhibited CD6 and CD2 phosphorylation of p21 and p-bound CD. CD7 revealed crucial indirect involvement in CD4 and CD6 phosphorylation, existence of CD-activating kinases other than7, and novel CD-dependent feedback by21 phosphorylation by4 and2 to sustain activation and pR inactivation and passage.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/M1 that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during meiosis in Arabidopsis plants. Meiosis is a process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction, and is triggered by transcription factors that activate a cascade of early, middle, and late genes. However, these factors are not conserved and mechanisms ensuring proper meiotic expression in multicellular eukaryotes are poorly understood. DUET1, a PHD finger protein, is essential for Arabid male meiosis and functions as a transcriptional regulator. It binds to H3Kme2 in vitro and this interaction is critical for its function during meiosis. DUET is also required for microtubule organization during me II, independently of its function in I. The protein shows stage-specific expression confined to diplot. Two genes, TDM1 and J, are critical for cell transitions and spindle organization in meiosis, and are targets of DU, with T1 being a direct. DU regulates microtub organization and cell transitions during me, and activates meiotic gene T1. Expression showed reduced expression of 12% of known meiotic genes in du mutant. Results reveal DU as transcription regulator during me in plants and suggest meiotic under stagewise control in plants as yeast.
Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by fragile X premutation CG repeats. Previous studies have shown that fragile X CG repeats are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and the CG-binding proteins α and hnRNP A/B can modulate CG-mediated neuronal toxicity. This study investigated the role of α in CG-mediated neurodegeneration using a proteomic approach, identifying over 100 proteins that interact with α. Notably, the Drosophila ortholog of p RNA helicase, R62, interacts with α and modulates CG-mediated neurogeneration. Biochemically, fragile X CG repeats decrease R62 transcription, leading to nuclear accumulation of Hsp transcript and additional stress/immune mRNAs. These findings suggest that abnormal nuclear accumulation of mRN, likely due to impaired export, contributes to FAS pathogenesis. 

The study focused on R62, the Dophila orth of p RNA helic, as it interacts with α and modulates CG-mediated neurogeneration. Fragile X CG repeats reduced viability of heterozygous R62 mutant flies, supporting a genetic interaction between R62 and CG-mediated cell death. R62 is the Dila orth of p RNA helic. The study reports nuclear accumulation of mRN caused by X premutation CG repeats, indicating a potential deficit in nuclear export contributing to FAS path. Earlier studies showed α and hnNP A/B are CG-binding proteins modulating CG-toxicity. 

Systematic proteomic, genetic, and microarray analyses show nuclear accumulation of mRN by X prem CG repeats contributes to FAS, potentially via impaired export due decreased R62. Altered H70 and turnover is similar to R62/p mutation. Fragile X prem CG repeats likely produce deficits in export mediated by R62, such as H70. Nuclear accumulation interferes with neurons' ability to respond to stress.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that forms environmentally and clinically relevant biofilms, has been studied as a paradigm for biofilm development. The extracellular matrix of P. aerugin biofilm is an ill-defined mix of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. This study directly visualized the product of polyschar synthesis (Psl polyschar) at different stages of biofilm development. During attachment, P is anchored on the surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and matrix assembly, holding bacteria in biofilm on surface. Chemical dissociation of P from bacterial surface disrupted P matrix and bio structure. During bio maturation, P accumulates on periphery 3-D microcolonies, resulting in P matrix-free cavity in microcol center. At dispersion, cells appear in matrix. Dead and extracellular DNA (eDNA) concentrated in P-free area. Deletion genes controlling cell death autolysis affected matrix and microcol dispersion. Data provide mechanism for P aerugin builds matrix and cavity for cell seeding. Visualization reveals P a key matrix component, opening avenues for bio-related complications. P polyschar, main component of extracellular animal and plant tissue, also microbial bio constituent. Three polyschar, P, Pel, and alginate contribute bio in P. aerugin. P polyschar, encoded polyschar locus PA1-224, required bacterial adhere substratum and bio structure. aerugin forms matrix, facilitating adherence and bio architecture. P matrix does not overlap eDNA, coordinating bio structure. Data indicates P key component P aerugin bio, likely persistence.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumors and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 pairs of matched primary tumor, PDX, and PDO. They developed a pipeline to score concordance between PD models and paired tumors for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy variations. Tumor comparisons displayed single-gene concord across major PD driver genes but poor agreement across mutational load. Genome and chromosome-centric analysis of structural (SV) events highlighted unrecognized concordance across chromosomes demonstrating clustered events. Ploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy changes; however, ploidy-correct copy states showed good agreement between donor pairs. The study found that PDX and PDO may serve as tractable transplant systems for probing molecular properties of PD, but may best serve selective analyses across levels of genomic complexity.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 19,091 breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent, including Chinese, Korean, and Japanese women, to identify novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. They analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, evaluating 5,365 SNPs in 3,972 and 3,852, and 94 SNPs in 5,203 and 5,138. The top 22 SNPs were investigated in 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 and 9,934). The study found a significant association between rs9482, near the TGF-activated kinase 2 gene on chromosome 6q25.1, and breast cancer risk, with a P-value 3.8×10-12 in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for A/G and A genotypes, respectively, compared to the G genotype/G. Additionally, SNPs rs395 (P=1.9×10-6) in the ESR gene and rs7107 (P=4.6×10-7) at 11q24.3 showed consistent association in each stage. This study provides evidence for a novel breast susceptibility locus represented by rs9482 and identifies possible loci in ESR and 11.24.
A study of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa revealed high genetic diversity, with 50 sequence types identified, including 18 novel ones. The isolates were grouped into three main types, VNI, VN, and VNB, with 72% belonging to seven high-frequency types. Spatial analysis showed no geographical clustering, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent acquisition. Comparison of multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) data with clinical parameters found a relationship between lineage and outcome, with VNB having worse survival (HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003), maintained after adjusting for prognostic indicators and treatment. Phenotypic assays on a subset of 89 isolates showed lineage-associated virulence, with VN increased lacc activity (p=0.001) and ex vivo CSF survival (p=0.000). This indicates Cryptoccus is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen and lineage plays a role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of a newly evolved signaling pathway that regulates the pheromone response in the white phenotype of Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen. The elucidation of this component provides a comprehensive description of the pherone response pathway in the white phenotype of C. albicans, offering insights into how signaling pathways may evolve. The pathway appears to have derived from three ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans: the upstream portion, including receptors, trimeric protein, and MAP kinase cascade, from the opaque pherone response of mating; Tec, transcription factor from filamentation; and white-specific downstream genes from biofilm. This evolution provides a paradigm for how signaling pathways evolve. The white pathway is young and has not had time to duplicate or modify components in response to selective pressures, offering a glimpse into the evolution of a new pathway. Tec activates genes in shared with opaque pher response and membrane processes, including adhesion and biofilm. The opaque and white pathways differ, with C. alb sharing components with S. cerevisiae haploid pherone pathway from transcription activator.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genomic GC-content and mutation patterns in bacteria by examining synonymous polymorphism datasets from 149 species. They found a significant excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in GC-rich bacteria, but the opposite pattern in AT-rich bacteria, across various phylogenetically diverse species. This excess cannot be attributed to mutation bias, as it would imply a decline in GC-content in GC-rich bacteria, which is unsustainable. Translational selection and gene conversion are also unlikely explanations, as optimal codons are AT-rich and the excess GC→SNPs occur in datasets with no recombination evidence. Therefore, selection for increased GC-content is present in many species. Since GC-content is correlated with genomic-content, selection on base composition is also present in bacteria.

The study analyzed 149 species from 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera with at least 8 sequences and 10 synonymous polymorphisms at 4-fold sites. GC→AT nucleotide diversity was less than 0.1. GC-rich bacteria showed a genuine excess of GC→ mutations, while AT-rich showed the opposite. The excess AT→GC in AT-rich may be due to infinite sites violation. Restricting analysis to species with low diversity reduced violations: 14 of 25 with diversity 0.5.
Researchers developed a new approach to map the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections (STH) in Kenya using data from 106,370 individuals surveyed between 1974 and 2009. They used Bayesian space-time geostatistical models to predict the probability of infection exceeding 20% across the country for 1989 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined STH prevalence, incorporating a correction for associations between species. Population data was combined with models to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009. Results showed high endemicity below 20% in most areas, with areas ≥20% around Lake Victoria and coast. Comparison of 198 and 2009 distributions showed STH prevalence decreased over time. The model estimated 2.8 million school-age children in districts warranting mass treatment. Bayesian-space geostat models can estimate combined STH prevalence and suggest a quarter of Kenya's school children live in high-prevalence areas warranting treatment. Control reducing infection, updated models can refine decision-making in helth control.
Researchers investigated the role of innate lymphocytes in immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. They found that splenocytes from uninfected mice produced interferon-γ when cultured with M-infected macrophages, suppressing bacterial replication. This control was dependent on CD1-restricted invariant NKT (iKT) cells, which required CD1 expression by infected macrophages and IL-12 and IL-18. iKT cells, even in limiting quantities, restricted M replication. Adoptive transfer of primary iKT cells from uninf mice significantly reduced bacterial burden in the lungs of mice infected with virulent M by aerosol. iKT had a direct bactericidal effect, independent of synthetic ligands. This is the first evidence that CD-restricted N cells mediate protection against M in vivo. Innate lymphocytes, including NK cells, play a role in resistance to various infections, but their contribution to M immunity is controversial. Following M infection, NK cells are activated and rapidly produce interferonγ, a critical for macrophage activation. Blocking IL-12 or IL-18 abrogated control of replication, indicating iKT activation and control was dependent on IL-12 and IL-18. Splenocytes restricted mycobacterial growth dependent on iKT. CD-restricted N cells were tested using mice lacking N cells; CD1−/− lack both invariant and CD-restricted NKT, while J281/− are deficient in iKT. Absence of CD-restricted cells did not alter tuberculosis outcome in previous studies.
Researchers investigated the regulation of Bacillus subtilis spore coat transglutaminase (Tgl), an enzyme responsible for cross-linking proteins in the spore coat. Unlike other transglutases, T is produced in an active form and catalyzes amine incorporation and cross-linking in vitro without additional requirements, raising questions about how its activity is controlled during spore assembly. The study found that substrates assembled onto the spore prior to T production govern its localization to the sp surface, and identified glutamyl (Q) and lys (K) docking sites crucial for this process. The first step in the reaction, interaction with substrates and formation of acyl-enzyme intermediate, determines T localization. Consistent with T exerting "spotting" activity, cross-linking pre-assembled complexes, T forms high molecular weight oligomers in vitro and becomes part of cross-linked products. The dependency on substrates controls time, location, and extent of T's activity, directing coval fortification of pre-as complexes at sp surface. This mechanism ensures proper temporal and spatial control of spore protein cross-link and specificity of T's action.
A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages in Champas province, Lao PDR in 2007 to investigate the distribution and risk factors of Opisthorchis vivini infection. The study found a 61.1% prevalence of O. vivini among 3,371 participants with complete data. Geostatistical models identified age, Lao ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation (farmer, fisherman, animal breeder), and unsafe water source as risk factors for infection, while history of praziquel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater were protective. Spatial patterns of O. vivini were governed by environmental factors, with predictive modeling identifying two risk profiles: low in mountains and high in the Mekong corridor. The study provides the first map of O. vivini infection in Champas province, important for targeting control efforts. Infection with O. viv appears associated with exposure to intermediate host, human behavior, culture, and transmission sustained by lack of sanitation.
In Dar es Sala, Tanzania, the presence of Anopheles and Cule larvae, vectors of lymphatic filariasis and malaria, is a significant concern due to the city's extensive network of drains with inadequate flow, often blocked by waste, causing flooding after rainfall. A study analyzed data from the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special survey in 2006 found that more than 70% of larval habitats in Dar Sala were human-made, with aquatic habitats associated with agriculture having the highest proportion of Anophe and Cule presence. Drains, however, comprised 42% of habitats and 43% of all culicine and 33% of anopheline habitats. The odds of finding Anophe and Cule larvae were 8.8 and 6.3 times larger in drains with stagnant water compared to flowing water. A positive association was found between vegetation and mosquito presence. The proportion of habitats with larvae was spatially correlated. Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar Sala has potential to eliminate over 40% of mosquito larval habitats treated with laricides by UMCP. Human-made larval habitats for both diseases highlight the need for synergy between control efforts.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to an increase in HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) activity through the impairment of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation. This results in a cholesterol-enrich cellular environment favoring viral replication. Studies using enzymatic assays, ELISA, and Western blotting found higher MG activity in DENV-infected cells associated with AMPK inactivation. Metformin, an AMP activator, declined MG activity, suggesting AMP inactivation mediates enhanced MG. Reduced AMP phosphorylation activity was observed in DENV-infected cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection. MG and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating a role in DENV replicative complex formation. Metform and lovastatin, an MG inhibitor, altered co-localization as well as replicative complex formation, supporting active MG required for formation. Metform prompted dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV-infected cells, while compound C, an AMP inhibitor, augmented viral copies and infected cells. PP2 activity, a modulating MG phosphatase, was unaffected by D infection. Data demonstrate elevated MG activity in DENV cells mediated AMP inhibition, not increased PP activity. Inhibition showed antiral effect in MG-independent manner. Results suggest D infection increases MG through AMP inactivation leading to cholesterol endoplasmic retic for replicative formation.
Researchers used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 70S ribosome to investigate the kinetics and energy landscape of tRNA translocation. They found that the process can be decomposed into slow, large-scale collective movements and rapid local fluctuations, with specific regions of the ribosome undergoing coordinated displacements. The study identified collective coordinates that capture 30-body rotation, 30-head swivel, and tRNA displacements, which are essential for substrate translocation. These findings provide a bridge between kinetic and energy measurements, allowing for the estimation of free energy barriers associated with translocation. The analysis was performed for a specific kinetic scheme, but the framework is general and can be applied to other energetic and kinetic descriptions. The study establishes a foundation for understanding tRNA translocation in the ribosome, providing a unifying interpretation of available data.
Researchers investigated the genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) by analyzing 84 sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel. They identified 101 mutations in 18 genes, with the most common being in the RET proto-oncogene, occurring in 47 cases, followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threon kinase 11, v-Hardyuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, mut homolog 1, Kiest ratcoma viral oncogene hom, and MET-oncogene. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and break-ap fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), with 2 of 98 cases positive for ALK. Targeted sequencing identified Glutaminefructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GF1)-ALK and echoderm microtubule-associated protein 4 (E4)-ALK fusions. PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the GF1-ALK fusion, indicating an intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. A metastatic M case with E4ALK showed a dramatic response to AL inhibitor crizotin. The study found several mutations in MTC and first identified AL fusions in M, suggesting E4ALK may be a driver and target for AL inhibitors, and GFALK a candidate for molecular therapy.
A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to evaluate the role of asymptomatic Leishmanias in the transmission of visceral Leishias (VL) and post-Kala-azar Dermal Leishias (PKDL) in the region. A total of 289 individuals were screened for Leishial antibody using R-39 rapid diagnostic kits, and 185 were found positive. Of these, 96 had a history of VL/PK and 89 did not. 79 were classified as asymptomatic Leishias and 10 as active VL with a ratio of 7.9:1. Among asymptomatic cases, 2 were lost to follow-up as they moved to other places. Progression to disease among asymptomatic individuals occurred up to 3 years after baseline. Seroconversion in 62/77 (80.52%) and disease in 8/77 (10.39%) were noted. 7 (9.09%) remained seropositive after 3 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic Leish infection was 3.16% (79/97), lower than 5.62-13.8% in other studies in Bihar. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1. Individuals with no history of VL/PK but positive for Leishial antibody were classified as asymptomatic. Those who became seronegative during follow-up were referred as seroconversion and developed symptoms of VL/PK as progression.
Researchers used a technique called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genetic rearrangements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome caused by the presence of the Ty retrotransposon Ty. They found that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty was random and the majority were mediated by six specific targets on four chromosomes, despite 254 potential targets in the genome. The majority of Ty-mediated translocations resulted from RAD-dependent recombination, but a number of non-recipro translocations were mediated by RAD-independent recombination between Ty elements. RAD-independent trans did not require Rad51 or Rad59 homolog proteins or Rad1-10 endonuc complex. Defects in ASF-RT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 resulted in increased Gs and whole-chromosome duplications and aneupidy. MLPA is a versatile technique for rapid analysis of Gs and facilitates genetic pathways that prevent and promote Gs and aneupidy.
Researchers have developed a new method for protein docking, called Semi-Definite-based Underestimation (SD), which uses stochastic minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions (SE(3) to account for flexibility of interface chains. The method underestimates a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias sampling, effectively minimizing functions with funnel-shaped basins. However, applying SD to rotational and translational space (SE(3) is challenging due to its geometry. To address this, a strategy separates variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and five angular descriptors of relative orientations is introduced. Removing the center-to-center distance improves efficiency, as the five-dimensional space exhibits a well-behaved energy surface for underestimation. The algorithm explores the energy surface spanned by encounter complexes corresponding to local energy minima, similar to macromolecular association through collisions. Results show the free energy landscape is a funnel in a broad neighborhood of the native state, and SD generates predictions with less than 5Å ligand interface root-mean-square deviation, achieving a 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The application of SD to protein-protein docking validates the funnel assumption of the energy landscape, but direct application in SE(3 fails to yield underestimators due to energetically favorable distances when proteins are in contact but not overlap. The method discovers broad funnels, generates quality predictions, and substantial efficiency compared to Monte Carlo.
