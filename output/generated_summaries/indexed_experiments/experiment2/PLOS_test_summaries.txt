Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of reported cases of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (H, also known as sleeping sickness), a fatal vector-borne disease, over the past two decades. However, pockets of infection remain, and it is crucial to assess which regions are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. A stochastic model for H in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was developed and fitted to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kwu province, using a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology. This is the first time a stochastic H model has been directly fitted to data, allowing for quantification of uncertainty in results. The model reflects spatial heterogeneity in cases, predicting that Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, will be the last to achieve elimination under current strategies. Deterministic and stochastic models were compared, with the latter producing virtually indistinguishable posteriorisation but faster computation times. This suggests using deterministic fits for health area expansion, but stochastic for capturing parameter and variation in reporting and elimination estimations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze the tumor microenvironment (ME) of cancer patients to better understand its composition and spatial distribution of cells and immune populations. This information can help predict patient outcomes and treatment success with immunotherapies. The approach uses spatial functions to summarize relationships in the ME and applies data analysis and random forest models to predict outcomes and identify important relationships. It was tested on simulated data and real data from triple-negative breast and lung cancer patients. The method is resistant to overfitting and false discovery rate.

The approach begins by creating functions for cell-cell interactions in images, reduces dimensions using principal components analysis, and combines with patient data to predict outcomes. Spatial functions have been used in ME analysis before. An example shows immune cell distribution around tumor cells in a breast cancer patient. The method aims to compare ME and clinical data between patient groups and identify differences in cell phenotypes, proteins, and predict a new patient's group using ME data. Various technologies are available, each with benefits and trade-offs. Comparing ME, spatial relationships between cells and proteins predict outcomes and guide interventions.

The method was applied to TNBC and lung data from multiplex ion imaging. For TNBC, tumors were separated into "compartmentised" and "mixed" groups based on tumor-immune interactions. The approach was effective in identifying interactions and controlling false rate. The method is publicly available in R package funkells.
Researchers investigated how abnormal neural synchronization in the brain, observed in various disorders, affects brain function. They computationally studied neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure changes, particularly during desynchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbations. To investigate the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, they combined a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic and structural plasticity: (i) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), (ii) homeostatic structural plasticity (SP), without weight-dependent and ST, (iii) combination of ST and SP, without weight pruning, and (iv) combination of ST and SP that includes SP and weight pruning. To accommodate diverse neuronal firing timescales, they introduced a simple stochastic model, enabling numerical analysis. Network theory revealed that structural reorganization remarkably enhances network synchrony. Weaker connections were preferentially eliminated by weight-pruning, synchrony was achieved with sparser connections in STDP model. Strengthening contacts from high-firing neurons to low-firing and weakening in opposite, followed by removal, allowed strong synchrony with fewer connections. This reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. They compared desynchronization of synchronized states in STDP with desynchronization models iii and iv. Latter required higher intensity for long-term desynchronization. Findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive modalities inducing lasting relief, e.g., Parkinson's disease.
Researchers have studied the regeneration of the nervous system in planarians, a type of flatworm, and found that neurons and glia (supportive cells) are regenerated from distinct progenitors. They discovered that neurons express a gene delta-2 at specific positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems, while glia are specified from Notch-1-expressing mesodermal phagocytic progenitors. Inhibiting delta-2 or Notch-1 reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect other phagocytic cell types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation associated with them, while transplanting delta-2-express photoreceptors formed glia at ectopic locations. This suggests a model where delta-2-express neurons instruct phagoc progenitors to differentiate into glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of neuron and glia numbers and types.

A model is proposed where delta-2-express neurons interact with Notch-express phoc progenitors to regenerate planarian neurons and glia. This hypothesis presents a solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia, where delta-2 on neurons and Notch on phoc progenitors specify gl fate and differentiation. This mechanism's modularity allows for evolution of new gl configurations in the nervous system by neurons acquiring or losing delta-2 and accessing phoc progenitors.

Notch signaling's role in neuronlia development led researchers to explore its role in planarian glia regeneration. Notch signaling is essential for cell fate specification and patterning in Metazoa. The regeneration of planarian neurons and glia and lack of gl fate programs in stem cells suggest a mechanism between nervous and phoc progenitors specify gl.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 in individuals with varying levels of neutralization breadth. Participants were characterized as "broad" or "non-road" neutralizers based on their ability to neutralize the virus. γδ T cells were analyzed from pre-infection and during acute infection (AHI) in 217 individuals. Results showed significant differences in γ T cell surface marker expression between neutralizers and non-neutralizers. Activation of γ T cells within the first weeks of infection was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on V1 T and CD57 on V2 T cells was higher in broad neutralizers and associated with development of neutral breadth later. Levels of CD on V1 T were associated with early Env-specific IgM production. Conversely, V1 expansion occurred during chronic infection and was not associated with viral load. Expression of CD on V1 and CD57 on V2 during A was higher in broad and associated with development of neutral later. Levels of CD on V1 were associated with early Env-specific Ig production. The study found V2 cells reduced during A and loss associated with viral load. Understanding γ T promotion of neutralization could inform vaccine strategies targeting these cells to improve humoral responses, especially broad and potent antibody to HIV-1 Env.
Researchers have discovered that tumor-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner. Blocking the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in preclinical mouse cancer models. Bispecific antibodies, which combine two antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to enhanced avidity and dual targeting. However, elucidating the mechanisms of binding and inhibition is crucial for maximizing efficacy. A computational model of BS1 was developed to study multivalent binding, providing insights into affinity and avidity effects, guiding therapeutic design. Simulations of monovalent and bivalent interactions between antibody constructs and IL-6 and IL-8 receptors established how properties and conditions impact binary and ternary complex formation. Results demonstrated balance drives inhibition, providing predictions for effective design. A bispecific antibody BS targeting IL-6R and IL-8 was modeled, comprising ODEs for receptors, antibodies, and complexes. To target IL-6/8 signaling for metastasis inhibition, a novel bis antibody BS was engineered against IL-6 and IL-8. BS contains variable domains of anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-8 antibodies. Data suggest targeting IL-6, IL-8, and receptors inhibits metastasis and cancer lethality. Monoclonal antibodies have been in anti-cancer regimens due specificity, stability, construction, and multi-faceted actions. Simulations of BS binding over antibody concentrations and cells with IL-6 and IL-8 expression levels revealed receptor and ternary complex formation. The level of receptor determines bivalent binding, and relative targets are critical for bis antibodies. Simulations showed IL-6 and IL-8 1:1 ratio bis binding identical to anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-8 monospecific.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doubleort-family kinase, in the assembly and stability of centrosomal spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. ZYG-8 is a mammalian homolog that is upregulated in many cancers and implicated in cell division, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. Depletion of ZYG- from oocytes resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects. Experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that Z-8 depletion led to excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role in regulating the force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Z-8 is also required for microtule dynamics within the oocyte and kinase activity is required during both meiosis and mitosis. The study proposes that Z-8 plays two roles: 1) regulating microt dynamics to facilitate proper turnover of microtules within the spindle, and 2) influencing motors that walk along microtules to tune forces and stabilize the spindle. Z- contains a microtule-binding doubleort domain and kinase domain. Previous studies demonstrated Z- is required for proper spindle positioning in mitotically dividing embryos and modulates microule dynamics in mitosis. This study shows Z- is required for assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle, and kinase activity is required for functions in both mitosis and meiosis, revealing roles in modulating microule dynamics and motor forces within the oocyte.
This study investigated the relationship between circulating metabolites, genetics, and type 2 diabetes (T2) risk in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids (HDL, ID, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. Integrating data with large T2 GWAS from the DIANTE meta-analysis, Mendelian randomization analyses found 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2, all lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2, spanning all classes, including branched amino acids. Interaction trait locus (QTL) analysis described four metabolites replicated in an independent Estonian Biob dataset, with genetic loci in different regions attenuated in T2 cases compared to controls. Variants from QTL were significant for corresponding metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, indicating T consequences on genetic regulation. Differential analyses found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both T complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of 165 metabolites, 40 were not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting mechanisms specific to complications.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to tolerance to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in mice. They crossed two strains, CC061 and CC, which are susceptible and tolerant to MRSA, respectively, to generate F1 and F2 populations. The F1 and F2 mice showed 65% and 55 survival rates after MRSA infection, indicating a complex inheritance pattern of the tolerant phenotype. Colonization in F2 mice was more extreme than their parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 was identified for survival and weight change after infection, with the WSB/EJ allele in CC mice contributing to tolerance. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, with high-impact variants in this region, are receptors for complement C5a, anaphylatoxin, which can trigger a massive immune response. The researchers hypothesize that C5 may have altered binding variant in CC mice, reducing cytokine damage and allowing tolerance to higher pathogen burden and survival.
Researchers investigated how genetic networks influence adaptation during evolutionary walks towards a phenotypic optimum. They modeled a trait as a product of a gene regulatory network, specifically an autoregulatory motif, and used forward genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks in both additive and network models. Contrary to the expectation from adaptive theory, both models harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles. The network model had a complex bimodal distribution of fitness among mutations, with a considerable density of deleterious coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. The study suggests that interactions from networks can generate complex distributions of fitness effects. 

The researchers combined biological realism of network modeling with tools to evaluate the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks, finding differences from classical expectations in some cases. Both models exhibited similarities in key aspects of adaptive walks, such as the number of steps and distribution of fitness among fixations and beneficial mutations. However, the network model had fewer large-effect mutations than expected, especially as the walk progressed. This was highlighted by a difference in responses to selection: the rate of trait evolution. Network simulations approached the optimum more slowly than additive models on average. 

The study explored a simple network's influence on evolution during an adaptive scenario. Models have traditionally relied on genotype-phenotype relationships, overlooking gene networks driving trait expression. The distribution of fitness changed when non-additive maps were considered, affecting a population's chance to adapt. To address this, a gene network was considered and a nonlinear map into adaptive theory. A trait foundation lies a network of genes and elements controlling protein expression.
Researchers have proposed a novel Bayesian framework for understanding how neurons integrate information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. They suggest that conductance-based neurons and synapses are naturally equipped to optimally perform this integration. In this framework, apical dendrites represent prior expectations of somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. The authors demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the corresponding posterior. A gradient-based plasticity rule is derived, allowing neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. This theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and plasticity.

The authors interpret the physics of cortical neurons as Bayesian computations, showing that conduct-based models naturally compute posterior distributions from likelihood and prior in dendritic compartments. Somatic membrane dynamics is derived from gradient ascent on posterior, and synaptic plasticity matches posterior to a target distribution. Before plasticity, they discuss a consequence for dynamics from the Bayesian view, predicting neuronal properties differing from classical models. In conductance, somatic potentials reflect prior in absence of input, allowing dendrite to adjust reliability. The framework derives membrane dynamics and plasticity jointly via ascent on log-posterior of somatic potentials. Simulations demonstrate learning a multisensory task.
Researchers have used the Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) from experimental structures as a basis to classify and catalog domains from 48 whole proteomes in the AlphaFold Database. They achieved an average classification rate of 90% for domains or identifiable regions in all proteomes, classifying 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins of 226,424 amino acid residues. The study examined homologous populations in eukaryotes and bacteria, finding eukotes have a higher proportion of disordered regions and unassigned domains, as well as repeated globular and small proteins. Shared domains between eukotes and bacteria include Rossm, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. The study compared homolog groups from the proteome against the EC reference and stable groups enriched by predictions, discussing implications for future classification strategies for large protein sets. 

The classification rate for eukotes in the AlphaFold Database is lower than for bacteria, likely due to prediction and contextual errors in structured regions. Domain prediction models classified 98% of residues (Fig 1). Widespread access to previously unclassifiable proteins diminishes the gap between structural and sequence classification. Homolog groups enriched by domains and sequence annotations estimate the degree structure expanded knowledge of previously unknown domains.
Researchers investigated the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no antiviral treatment. They used single-cell analysis to study TAg expression throughout the cell cycle and found that robust TAg expression is required for host DNA replication, contradicting the current model where TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into S phase for viral replication. Instead, data supports a new model where BKV requires initial host S phase to replicate. This aligns with other small DNA viruses like papilloma and adenoviruses. At early timepoints, robust TAg was observed in ≥4 cells, suggesting BKV production depends on initial S phase. Chemical inhibitors preventing cellular replication showed viral replication relies on initial S phase. BKV is unusual as host DNA is re-replicated and re-replication is required for replication. To induce S and re-replication, the current model proposes early TAg causes S entry for viral. However, canonical licensing and firing mechanisms were required for re-re and displayed activity across the cycle. Findings change understanding of BKV life to include initial S for robust T expression and production. Late genes revealed VP/3 expression followed TAg as cells progressed to-replication, suggesting infectious formed in-replicating cells. This agrees with BKV cycle where TAg precedes late proteins but replication after 4.
Researchers have developed a novel transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) fine-mapping method called FIO to identify genes associated with binary traits, such as diseases. Unlike existing methods, FIO models all genes on a chromosome to capture correlations between genes, reducing false discoveries and increasing power. FIO uses a probit model to link genetically regulated expression to binary outcomes, accounting for correlations among genes in linkage disequilibrium. Simulations showed FIO outperformed existing approaches, reducing causal gene sets by 27.9-36% and prioritizing genes associated with diseases like asthma, gout, and hypertension. FIO is effective for TW fine-mapping binary traits.
This study investigates the role of Btn2 and Hsp protein sequeases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation and increase protein misfolding and aggregation. The absence of Btn and Hsp sequeases results in increased protein aggregation, suggesting they play a role in sequestering proteins formed during oxidative conditions. Hsp104 is required to protect against aggregation during oxidative stress, but its concentration remains unchanged, leading to the hypothesis that H104 may be limiting in Btn Hsp mutants. The study identifies Btn and Hsp sequeases as chaperones required for oxid tolerance, sequestering misfolded proteins into PQC sites following ROS exposure. Proper sequestration prevents dysfunction and toxicity associated with protein misfolding diseases. Btn and Hsp mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, implicating a role in oxidant tolerance. Data shows Btn and H act to protect against amorph and amyloid aggregation during oxidative conditions. Oxidative damage levels are similar in wild-type and sequease mutants, but aggregation is elevated, indicating Btn and H normally sequest oxidatively damaged proteins as part of the antioxidant system.
Researchers conducted a large-scale CRISPR-interference (CRISPR) screen to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with glioblastoma (GB) invasion. While previous studies have focused on coding genes, few have evaluated the role of non-coding RNAs without protein-coding potential in GB invasion. The study used CRPR to evaluate the invasive function of GB-associated lRNAs in an unbiased screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. A CRPR lRNA loss-of-function screen was implemented to evaluate the association of lRNA knockdown (KD) with invasion in Matrig. Top candidates were validated using CRPR and oligonucleotide (AS)-mediated knock in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Atlas (TA) and Genotypeissue (GT) Expression analysis. Mediators of lRNA effect were identified via differential expression following lRNA KD and assessed for invasion using knock and rescue experiments. Forty lRNAs were significantly associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion (p<0.01) upon knock. The top candidate, LINC45, identified a previously unannotated lRNA, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while L45 expression was significantly associated with patient and tumor grade (p<0.0001). RNA analysis of L45 knockdown revealed WAS3, implicated in tumor studies, was highly correlated with lRNA, while WAS KD was associated with significant in invasion. WAS overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive lost with L45 KD. CRPR screening identified L45 as critical to GB invasion, associated with tumor grade and survival.
Researchers investigated the brain's ability to assign probabilistic models to sequences of auditory stimuli using electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of stimuli generated by a stochastic process. A new clustering procedure was introduced to group EEG signals based on their similarity, allowing the retrieval of the brain's putative model of the sequence. The goal was to identify the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task, which remains an open question despite previous studies assuming specific models. The clustering procedure has the property of retrieving any possible partition of sets, enabling a more parsimonious model of the data. Employing this approach, regularities matching the algorithm used to generate the sequence were extracted from EEG data. The sequence generation process was defined by a context and a family of transition probabilities to choose the next stimulus given the past sequence. A model selection procedure was used to show that the brain uses strong occurrences of a stochastic sequence to select a model of random stimuli.
Researchers have identified a limitation in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, a method used to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, which fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcript-size (total number of transcripts per cell) and cell dissociation/processing-induced crypt gene expression. This is particularly problematic when analyzing heterogeneous solid tissues/ organs, requiring dissociation for analysis, resulting in a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq results and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF) is proposed. A method to compute and report WF for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs is introduced, validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc-se data and WF of composite cells. Additionally, WF is shown to predict aging progression, implicating diagnostic applications and association with aging. The study provides a method to solve limitations of sc-se analysis of solid organs and suggests utility and biological significance of WF.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Genetic variants giving outlying estimates are considered potentially pleiotropic. Radial plots can identify these variants, but analogous plots for MVM have been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature. A radial formulation of MVM and adapted radial plot are proposed, allowing the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. Radial MVM includes removal of outlying SNPs violating M assumptions. AVMR package is presented for implementing the methods. Simulations and analyses demonstrate effectiveness of radial M. Outliers can be visualized and removed through radial, decreasing bias under pleiotropy. Radial M is applied to estimate lipid on coronary disease.
Researchers studied the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species, by recording their movements at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in a controlled environment. They used a deep learning framework, SLE, to analyze the data and identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion, resulting in a dataset of nearly 2 billion instances. The study found distinct daily patterns in these behaviors, including trends in grooming, probis extension, and locom speed, providing new insights into the fly's circadian cycle. A unique patterns were observed in the hour after dawn, which correlated with other indicators of health, such as locom speed and time spent resting. The study also found a decline in probis extension and locom speed as time spent in idle increased across days, and differences in morning and evening activity peaks, primarily in grooming behavior.
Researchers have identified a novel function for the conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor PTP-22 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, establishing its role in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-bi genetic screen, they found that loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed mol defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in conserved NIMA kinases NE-2 and NE-3, which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. To understand P-22 functions, they carried out proximity studies to identify interactors of P-22 during development, identifying the CDC guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN-1 as an in vivo partner of P-22. Loss of DN- also suppressed ne-associated molting defects. Genetic analysis, localization, and labeling revealed roles for P-22 in epidermal adhesion complexes, including C elegans hemidesomes, suggesting P- plays a broad role in maintaining tissue integrity. Proximity labeling also implicated P- in functions connected nucleocytoplasm transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, nearly one-third of identified P proximity are gran components. These studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches identifying novel functions.
Researchers have developed a statistical model to predict the spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, a crucial for malaria elimination efforts. Artemisinin, the gold standard antimal drug, is threatened by resistance, which could lead to increased malaria cases and deaths if it spreads to Africa or India. Data on resistance levels in Southeast Asia are limited. The study used a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network on non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 (K) gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian statistical model to create spatio-temporal predictions. Maps show expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong region from 2000 to 202, with most change between 2010 and 2015. The model provides insights into spatial and temporal trends of artem resistance not possible with data alone, enabling fine-scale decision support. Predicting spatio patterns and extents of artem resistance at the subcontinent level, the study supports malaria goals in Southeast Asia. A geostat model of molecular markers associated with artem resistance in the Kel 13 gene was developed, calibrated to the WWARN dataset. Spatio-temp maps of K marker prevalence support resistance monitoring in Southeast, targeting strategies and elimination efforts. No fine-scale predictive maps exist for artem in Southeast, but molecular markers associated with resistance can be used. Historical samples have been reanalysed, providing significant data on prevalence. Predictive spatio-temp maps are presented for the first time of artem resistance in the Greaterong region.
Researchers have investigated the role of NLR1 and CARD8 proteins in the inflamome signaling pathway, which is crucial for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in different forms due to autoproteolysis within the FI domain, resulting in full-length (FL), cleaved N-terminal (NT), and cleaved-terminal (CT) peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. The study found that NLR paralogs and CARD8 form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FL-CT interactions with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 (mLR1) plays a role in NT-CT autohibitory, while Z5 of rat NLR1 and CARD8 mediate NT-CT interaction. Dipeptid peptidase 9 (D9) was also explored, revealing interactions and significance of domain. D9 binds FL-CT and NT of mLR1, r1 and CARD through Z5, forming NT-D9-CT; however, D9 cannot bind NT of hLR1. Functional assays showed D9 is involved in NT-CT of rodent NLR and CARD but does not influence inhibitory activity on CT. The study enhanced understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflamome autohibition and underscored complexity of interactions in immune response.
Researchers investigated the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wingelium. They found that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2 (eIF2), indicating the onset of prote stress in the ER. This is consistent with R1's proposed function as a regulator of ERostasis. Mutations in the rer gene were first identified in yeast, where it was required for proper transport of Sec12 between the ER and Golgi. In Dophila, loss of R1 creates prote stress in the wingel, and when surrounded by wild-type cells, clonal rer mutant cells attained the loser fate and were eliminated via cell competition. R1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth, despite high prote stress. This suggests R1 provides cytoprotection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating stress and supporting overgrowth. The study demonstrates R1 as a novel regulator ofost in Doph and its role in competitive survival.
Researchers investigated the impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3,188 amino acid changes resulting from SNVs in CHE2 have not been tested for their effect on the function of the CHE2-encoded protein (CHK2). The study used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test the ability of 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHE2 reading frame to complement a yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. Among the non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlate with previous structure and function data and provide a new functional assay for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. This approach can help predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants found in screening and be applied to other cancer genes.
Streptococcus pneumoniae forms genetically and phenotypically distinct populations through Psr-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase genes in the opacity-determin locus, resulting in a switch between opaque and transparent colonies with different methylation patterns that confer pathogenesis traits. However, the mechanism controlling hS orientations is unknown. This study reports the discovery of the Spx1-TA toxin-antitoxin system regulating hS orientations and bacterial epigen traits, such as colony opacity, by targeting pneumoc protein synthesis. Spx1 and Ten constitute a conserved type II system, with overexpressing Ten leading to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S. pneumonia, and antitox Spx1 repressing the spxA-ten operon. Ten binds ribosome factor Rim, reducing Com expression, which activates transformation genes, and enhances invertase psr, favoring transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Moderate Ten expression reshapes pneumoc epigen and colony. Spontaneous variations in the promoter region generate subpopulations with epetic and phenic diversity.
High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is desirable to compare datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns in one condition. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this as they operate on one dataset. Contrastive Principal Component Analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem but has little adoption due to requiring a hyperparameter with multiple solutions, no knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA foreground and background are treated differently, making it unsuitable to compare conditions symmetrically. Generalized Contrastive PCA (gcPCA) is developed, a hyperparameter-free approach solving these problems. It first explains why c requires a hyper and gc avoids this requirement. An open-source gc toolbox is provided with Python and MATLAB implementations of gc for different scenarios. gc is demonstrated in analyzing high-dimensional data, unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophys recordings and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell sequencing. As fast, robust, and easy-use method, gc facilitates analysis of high-dimensional to gain insights into complex phenomena.

gc is proposed to address c's problem, the hyperparameter requirement. It introduces a normalization to mitigate bias toward high-variance. The process of gc is summarized using gc v4.0, v2, and v3 are analogous. gc4.0 has the following function, shown in equation (eq. gc aims to find dimensions that account for variance in than (SA). gc builds on insights of c but solves c's key problem, the hyperparameter requirement. It addresses subtle questions, such as subsets exhibit correlations in A than B, or subsets up/downregulated in cells A than B.
Researchers developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The model revealed feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including negative cros from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of cros was verified in B and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by phosphoproteomics on ERK and ERK sites. The BL-2 network was transferable to BL-41 cells and also modeled B signaling in diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling, indicating B aberration does not cause major rewiring. A semi-quantitative network of BCR was established and tested in different cell lines to describe conserved B receptor signaling. Phosphoprote analyses supported key insights of the model. The BL-2 network formed a base to describe DLBCL with aberrant B signaling. Feedback and cros in ER and p38 were conserved across B lymphoma types, but no dependency was found in studied cells. Three novel connections improved the model: positive c from mTOR to JNK, positive from GSK to ZAP, and negative from p38 on RAF/MEK/ER. A semi-quant model of BCR in BL-2 was used to assess general B signaling. BL-2 was chosen due to its role in acute B signaling. BL- cells respond to α-Ig with transient activation and plateau.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Notch receptor signaling network in tissue growth and maintenance, focusing on the opposing mechanisms that regulate its activity. Notch signaling is triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands in neighboring cells and inhibited by ligands binding to the same cell. Different Notch/ligand combinations elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signaling. This study explores the molecular basis of Notch ligands DLL and JAG, which control angiogenic sprouting through a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches. The results show that DLL induces efficient Notch receptor activation, while J1 blocks DLL-dependent inhibition through a J1/DLL complex formation. A new model of Not signaling is proposed, recapitulating tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The study reveals a previously overlooked role of heteromeric JAG/DLL complexes, enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. Data argue that hetereric J/DLL complex relieves Notch receptor inhibition, enabling efficient Not signaling. Consistent with findings, DLL homomers and DLL-J1 heteromers mediate Notch inhibition. Angiogenic sprouting involves a regulated interplay between Not signaling and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEF) signaling. A new model is proposed, incorporating the finding that J1 antagonizes DLL through hetereric DLL-J1 complexes, underlying observed effects in sprouting.
Researchers have developed Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM), an extension of a Bayesian non-parametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points. They demonstrate that DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. A novel procedure is introduced for summarizing a gene signature on a dataset different from where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three gene expression datasets with IMD are summarized using relevant signatures and DPM clusters are associated with disease, replicated across datasets. This work shows that when data has uncertainty, it should be used to inform clustering and presents a method, DPM. Additionally, a procedure is presented for using gene signatures in datasets other than where they were defined, showing value by summarizing expression from patients with IMD using DPM. Clustering by engineered GWAS features recapitulates known relationships in IMD and suggests using uncertainty for clustering, such as individuals with polygenic scores where uncertainty could be exploited. A method is proposed for summarizing gene expression across a signature, extending possible uses since signatures may be weaker on datasets with complex structure. Two examples show ignoring uncertainty led to clusterings not associated with disease.
Deep neural networks have been successful models of the primate visual system, but fail to account for the importance of shape in primate vision. Humans judge category membership to a large extent on shape, while deep networks rely more on color and texture. This problem has been documented, but reasons unclear. We designed artificial images where shape, color, and texture can predict class, and trained networks to classify with single features and combinations. Some architectures unable to learn shape, others use shape but biased towards other features. The bias explained by interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent, suggesting different algorithms with sparse, local changes make networks sensitive to shape and improve human vision.

We used artificial images to investigate why deep networks develop bias towards color and texture instead of shape. Some architectures, like vision transformers, unable to learn shape, while convolutional networks develop bias despite learning shape classification. Changes to architecture won't enable shape recognition, but algorithm changes required. Experiments 3 and 4 show color and texture bias from gradient dynamics, specifically gradients aligning with classes. Breaking alignment requires changing gradients, except spConv, all convolution networks biased color or texture. Focused on ConvNet to understand bias, able to classify by shape but fail shape if color or texture sufficient. Compared humans and networks learning categories by shape, color, object, or patch. Humans relied on shape, networks classified other features like color, size. Followed similar approach, why networks fail shape classification. NTK of color and texture networks, not shape, hypothesized dominant gradient dynamics explaining biased. Reducing color and texture gradients enables shape classification.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the dynamics of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and their role in liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic diseases. The model, based on the Kappa language, represents HSC as agents with seven physiological states interacting with TGFβ molecules, which regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, a main component of the extracellular matrix. Simulations revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion, with inactivation allowing elimination of activated HSC during reversion and reactivation of inactivated HSC (iSC) sustaining fibrosis. The model's sensitivity to TGF parameters suggests adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions. Experimental data from a mouse model of CCl-induced liver fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease. RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated liverrosis confirmed this, identifying iSC as novel markers of fibrosis. The study provides the first model of H dynamics in chronic disease, exploring regulatory role of iSC in liver homeostasis and can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework to estimate the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex traits and diseases, in large genomic consortia like the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program. The method, called Meta2, uses summary statistics and accounts for inter-study heterogeneity, such as varying genomic platforms, and is computationally efficient. It was applied to 5 TOP studies with 580 participants to estimate the mediation of gene expression on systolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The method is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub. Meta-analysis is an alternative to individual-level analysis in terms of feasibility and can evaluate heterogeneity across factors, as shown in application to Framingham Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Meta can characterize overall effect and individual mediators. The analysis adjusted for covariates like BMI, sex, age, smoking, race, gene profiling, and top PCs of gene data. Meta and systematic reviews have applied mediation to health outcomes, but its methodology is underexplored in high-dimensional analysis, particularly omics mediators.
Researchers have developed a novel method called PWH to identify driver genes responsible for cancer development in individual patients, taking into account the heterogeneity of driver events across patients. Unlike existing methods, PWH prioritizes mutated genes based on their impact on downstream gene expression in a group of patients with shared mutations and similar gene profiles. Experiments on 16 cancer datasets from TCG showed PWH excelled in identifying known and specific drivers, outperforming individual and cohort methods. Results demonstrated PWH could identify both common and rare drivers, providing personalized profiles for tumor stratification and understanding heterogeneity. One predicted gene, low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP1), was validated to promote tumor proliferation in vitro assays. Existing methods overlook that patients with same driver mutations share carcinogenic mechanisms, unlike those with same passengers. PWH incorporates higher-order relationships between mutated and abnormally expressed genes, improving driver prediction. Despite limitations, PWH demonstrated reliable performance inferring drivers, discovering obscured by heterogeneity. Future, PWH will aid personalized treatment development. PWH is a genome/transcript analysis identifying candidate drivers by leveraging mutated influence on networks across samples. Samples with same cancer type display similarity compared to different types. Leveraging samples from same type, closely resembling target, improves prediction. PWH requires cohort from TCG, somatic and expression, and interaction. For each type, predicted drivers were compared with other methods on overlap with known drivers. Known drivers identified by methods are illustrated for each type.
Researchers have developed a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy, called the Virtual Epileptic (VEP), which combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities to generate spatio-temporal seizure patterns resembling those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG. This allows for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. The study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach, specifically the SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions without excessive time. Benchmarking on synthetic data, the proposal successfully solved different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and performance against parallel solvers. Results were enhanced using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, a scalable uncertainty quantification phase was added to the model to assess variability in parameters across problems. This study has the potential to improve estimation of brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making.

The Virtual Epile Patient (VE) is a digital approach that integrates mathematical modeling of neural activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict brain networks involved in seizure generation and propagation. Achieving accuracy in modeling poses a challenge in inferring information from data, such as characterizing pathological networks from sterelect EEG. Optimizing parameters is essential for gaining insights into mechanisms of data-generating in pathological conditions, such as dynamics and connectivity of abnormal networks. The study aimed to select a resilient and efficient global solver, capable of parallel computing across platforms, from desktop to supercomputers. By capturing seizure dynamics and simulations, this technique offers a platform to optimize surgical strategy and aid clinical decision-making.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health issue with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung, but estimates of Mtb replication and death rates in lungs of patients or animals, such as monkeys or rabbits, are largely unknown. Experiments were conducted with rabbits infected with a virulent clinical M isolate of the Beijing lineage, H878, carrying plasmid p10. In vitro, p10 was found more stable in H878 than the commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37R, with a segregation coefficient of 0.1 in H878 vs 0.18 in H37. The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in M-infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline; the percent plid cells increased between 28-56 post-infection and remained between 84-112 post-infection, despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late points. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monotonic change in percent plid cells can be explained by a lung M population of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics: one expanding early and controlled/eliminated, while a smaller expanding at times causing a counterintuitive increase in percentid cells. A model with kinetically homogeneous M population could not explain the data, even when run stochastically. Given H878 forms circumscribed granomas, results suggest bacterial dynamics in granomas.
Researchers have developed a computational tool called GlycanModeler, also known as GlyTreeer, to predict and determine the structure of glycans, which are carbohydrate molecules attached to proteins. Glycans play a crucial role in various biological functions, but their structure is difficult to determine experimentally. Glycaner uses kernel density estimates of common glycan conformations from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The tool was tested on various glycan structures and showed high accuracy in both de novo modeling and density-guided building. Glycaner was used to design glycans into a protein vaccine to shield regions from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This work will aid glycoprotein prediction, glycan masking, and computational structure determination refinement.

Glycobiology tools have been developed for protein glycosylation, structural validation, analysis, and docking. Common glycop modeling methods involve molecular dynamics simulations or manual glycan placement into density. Recent tools focused on aiding structure determination using density, especially for resolved glycans like HIV. Glycaner was tested for density-guided modeling and decoy discrimination.

Glycaner and associated tools model glycans through de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm was optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity, achieving a median RMS of 2.7.7. Protocols continue to be optimized, and deep learning becomes integral to modeling and design. Results show Glycaner accurately predicts structures de novo, builds into density, and coats protein surfaces.
In the fungus Penicillium oxalicum, the ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF (Skp-Cull-F-box) complex plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality control through ubiquitination. The Skp-Cull-F-box complex recognizes substrates via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate, with the F-box determining substrate specificity. However, the limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field. The transcription factor Ace1, also known as Slt, positively correlates with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively with the expression of hemi-cellulase genes. The ubiquitinase-substrate pair SCFbx-Ace1 is identified in P. oxalic, with most PoF23 present in the free form within the nucleus and a small portion associating with Sk1 to form the PoF23-Skp heterodimer. Under glucose, Po23 absence results in decreased transcription of the brA gene, which encodes the master regulator of asexual development and spore pigmentation genes, and impaired conidiation. Under cellulose, transcription of hemi-cellase genes in the mutant are significantly upregulated. Po23 acts as a transcription coactivator, recognizing and activating Ace, allowing it to regulate transcription of genes with different effects under signals. Po23 recognizes and activates the transcription factor Ace within the nucleus, which is a ubiquitinated protein.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the formation and diversification of the basement membrane (BM) in Drosophila melanogaster's follicular epithelium. They found that two parallel protein secretion routes, mediated by Rab10 and Rab8, are essential for BM production. Rab10 promotes lateral and planar-polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion, leading to the formation of fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. The dystroph-associated protein complex (DAP) and Rab10 are present in a plan-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins, with DAP being essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab route. The exocyst complex has a dual function: it interacts with dystroph to limit planar polarization and is required for the Rab8 route. These findings highlight the mechanistic aspects of BM secretion and how diversity emerges from spatial control of distinct routes. The study proposes the coexistence of parallel secretory routes with different cell sites defined by polarity as a mechanism for BM diversification during development.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which are crucial for HIV treatment. The model, called language-based universal model (LB), uses multi-task learning (MTL) to improve predictions and address two challenges: underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes in current datasets and combinations of Abs required to avoid resistance to a single Ab. MTl mitigates bias against underrepresented subtypes and allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance between Abs, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimal Ab combinations. The LB model was trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with non-Ab and Ab data, outperforming classical machine learning algorithms, random forests and gradient boosting. The study's aim was not only to predict HIV-1 resistance to 33 Abs, but to address key challenges in HIV-1 research. The model's performance is expected to increase with more data and diversity. The model is publicly available and can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow, with varying treatment effects between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that pathway dysfunction is closely associated with disease progression. This study considered two strategies constructing predictive models taking pathway information into account: pathway score method and grouplasso using pathway information. Pathway score method converted gene expression to sample-wise scores for fitting, using three methods (ssSEA, GS, GS, and z-scores) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. Implemented in microarray data (GSE324), a candidate model with best performance in validation was obtained. The model was compared with gene-based and published models in external data. Effects of missing values on prediction were investigated, showing grouplasso incorporating pathway (VAX) more competitive than gene in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including V pathways, seemed predictive for MM. V outperformed previously models, and was more resistant to missing values, with presence <5% not deteriorating accuracy using imputation method. Pathway-based models using grouplass were alternatives to gene-based for MM, documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM) with imputation facilitating future validation.
Researchers have developed a nonlinear dynamical systems model to study the process of mitochondrial fission, which is the division of a mitochondrion into two daughter organelles. The model focuses on the role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Dr1) in this process, which is crucial for cellular response to injury. The model identifies a key parameter, μ, which represents the maximum rate of disassembling of Dr1 oligomers, that regulates the total fission rate (TFR) and cumulative fission (TF) over time. The model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with parameter μ = k + k - M, where M is the concentration of mitochondrial fission factor, and k and k are association and dissociation constants between Dr1 and oligomers on the mitochondrial membrane. Surprisingly, TF does not monotonically increase with μ, but rather increases to a point and then decreases as μ continues to increase. This non-monotonic dependence suggests that targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive effects on fission. Understanding the impact of regulatory parameters like μ may aid in future therapeutic selection.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-based gene drive system to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests by targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosoph suuk, a notorious pest. The system uses three gRNAs to induce nonfunctional mutations at desired sites, reducing selective pressure for resistance. A key feature is the ability to restore egg-laying defects in T2 mutant females by feeding octamine, allowing easier maintenance of the drive. The system was tested in Dros melanogaster and improved by introducing promoter-C9 transgenes to enhance homing efficiency. However, genetic polymorphisms in wild populations limit the spread of gene alleles and Cas9 activity is influenced by position. This study highlights the potential to conditionally rescue female infertility caused by the drive, offering a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.
Researchers have found that the brain's energy expenditure is not only limited by the energy required for computation, but also by the energy needed to form and maintain memories. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks, which require only a few synaptic updates, have a significant metabolic cost. In contrast, learning tasks like achieving 95% accuracy on MNIST require at least 108 synaptic updates, suggesting the brain has evolved to learn with minimal energy. To explore this, the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks, a parsimonious energy model was proposed. Two plasticity algorithms were introduced to save energy: 1) modifying only synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses forming a path through the network. Vanilla backpropagation updates all synapses, but restricting plasticity can save energy while incurring slightly worse learning time. This approach may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a match between artificial and biological learning. The algorithms may also benefit hardware as electronic storage is energetically costly. An energy measure was introduced assuming energy used solely by synaptic updates, finding a square root relation between energy and size, M ∝ N0.43.43. Results show large networks learn faster but use more energy, restricting plasticity can save. A subset of synapses were allowed to be plastic using a binary mask, drawn from Bernoulli distribution. Skipping uninformative samples during learning also saves energy. Future studies include adapting algorithms to task or architecture and efficient synaptic modification during transfer. The model can be refined with more data and efficiency re-examined.
Researchers investigated how laboratory evolution can overcome fitness defects caused by genome streamlining in the bacterium Acinetobacter bayi AD1x, which had deletions of 22-42 kilobase and 70-293obase regions. Populations of AD1x and each deletion strain were evolved for ~300 generations in chemically minimal and complex media, and genomes of endpoint isolates were sequenced. Fitness increased in all cases except two, which failed to improve in one environment. Mutations in protein-coding genes and small RNAs were associated with environments and deletions. Global transcription regulators, ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq, were mutated across strains, with varied effects on function and fitness. Mutations in this network likely compensated for earlier deletion in ADx ancestor, restoring csr function. Results show fitness lost during streamlining can be regained through evolution, often through deletion-specific and regulatory adjustments.
Researchers have developed a self-cleaving ribyme tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebraf, a vertebrate model organism. The tool, called T3-HHR, was inserted in the intron of a reporter gene and showed rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and superior activity compared to other ribymes. T-H was then inserted in the intron of the albino gene using CRISPR/Cas and observed pigmentation similar to the mutant. Using base-editing, the ribyme was inactivated and the phenotype was reversible, illustrating specificity. A Flase and Cre-activatable version, Ribo, was generated to control mRNA levels of alb. Ribo activation induced mRNA knockdown and recapitulated alb mutant phenotype. Additionally, Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in Ribo cassette labeled cells independently of target expression. The study introduces Ribo as a tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrate and alternative to existing knock strategies.
Researchers have developed a user-friendly software called "aiSEG" that can segment nuclei from bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the need for transgenic or fluorescent labeling, freeing up imaging channels, reducing phototoxicity, and speeding up imaging. The software uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structures in transmitted light images, which was previously only possible under optimized conditions. aiSEG accurately segments nuclei from challenging BF images, similar to manual segmentation, retaining biologically relevant information for quantification of biosensors signaling pathway dynamics. It is adaptable to new cases with only 32 images for retraining and accessible through command line and graphical user interface, not requiring expert coding experience. The software was evaluated on 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images from curated and novel data sets, including primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities. aiSEG performed well in prevalent conditions like low magnification and time lapse imaging of cells, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with large cytoplasm. Features associated with the nucleus were more important than whole cell or neighborhood, confirmed by interpreting aiSEG segmentations with GradCAM. Removing fluorescence enables additional markers and improved workflows. Segmentations are based on BF rich information about cells, interactions, and subcellular structures, crucial for assembling datasets for retraining.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments. One such property is the rate of change, as behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. They tested whether humans are biased to learn when task-relevant features change slowly rather than quickly. In two experiments and a preregister replication, 295 participants learned rewards of two-dimensional bandits with either slowly or quickly changing feature predicting the reward. Results showed participants accrued more reward when the relevant feature changed slowly and irrelevant quickly compared to the opposite. No difference was found in ability to generalise to unseen values between conditions. A set of function approximation Kalman filter models revealed higher learning rate for slow feature and adjustment to relevance and speed. Improvement in performance for slow compared to fast bandits correlated with stronger adjustment of learning rates. These results indicate human learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward.
Researchers have identified a novel gene, Res1, associated with metastasis in ER-negative breast cancer, a subtype with the worst prognosis. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in solid tumors, understanding its biology is crucial for effective intervention. Using a mouse genetics approach, 12 genes associated with metastasis were previously identified, and Res1, a poorly characterized gene, was found to be a novel metastasis gene in ER breast cancer. Res1 is a large, unstructured protein with conserved intron structure, but poor amino acid conservation. CRIS or trap mouse models crossed with Polyoma-T antigen engineered mouse (MT-PMT) showed reduction of Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and increased lung metastases consistent with patient data. Analysis of matched tissues revealed loss of wildtype in tumor, consistent with Res1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed Res1 role in transcription control through association with quadruplex sequences, particularly ribosomal biogenesis. Results suggest loss of1 enhances progression in ER breast cancer through transcriptional and translational control.

Res1 was identified as a tumor suppressor in ER breast cancer through analysis of two mouse strains with different tumor phenotypes. Genetic analysis of backcross population revealed association of genes with metastasis on chromosome 6. Expression in human cancer data and tumor samples indicated lower Res1 with worse outcomes. Experimental cross between Res1 and Py mouse showed reduced expression higher metastatic disease and pulmonary metastases. This study expands previous findings, providing evidence that Res1 is a tumor suppress and metast modifier in ER-negative breast.

Res1 is a poorly characterized gene, 152 amino acid product encoded by single exon. Res1 KO bred to Py model compared tumor phenotypes PyRes1/wt and Py1/KO heterozygous. Reduction of1 by CRPR deletion was associated increased tumor, rapid growth, and pulmonary metastases.
Researchers investigated the roles of the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. During meiosis, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are formed by the topoisomerase enzyme Spo11, activating the damage response kinase Mec1 via the clamp loader Rad24. Loss of Mec and Rad activity alters DS formation and recombination at single loci, but their genome-wide roles were not examined. The study used two strategies: deletion of the mismatch protein Msh2 and control of meiotic prophase via the Ndt transcription factor to characterise Mec and Rad's roles in meiotic recombination by genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny. Results showed that loss of Rad24 reduced spore viability and recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies, while loss of Mec increased recombination frequency and had less effect on spore viability. However, complex recombination events initiated by closely spaced DS in wild-type cells occurred more frequently in absence of either Rad or Mec, suggesting loss of spatial regulation at DS formation level. Both Mec and Rad also regulated crossovers (COs), with loss of either becoming more random, suggesting reductions in global interference.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the growth and metabolism of Pneumocyst jirovec, a deadly fungus that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, due to its inability to be cultured in vitro. The model, a comprehensive in silico-scale genome metabolic model, identifies metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro. Using published data and bioinformatics tools, the model was developed and validated, and Flux Balance and Reinforcement Analysis were employed to predict metabolic fluxes and critical components of Pneumyst growth. The findings provide insights into the biology of Pneumyst and a strategy to overcome culturing the pathogen vitro. A genome-scale model was also developed for Pneumyst murina, a mouse-specific pathogen, to experimentally test hypotheses and compare growth in vitro to in vivo. Predictions were made regarding Pyst growth and metabolism, including medium components and supplements to enhance growth. The model replicated drop and knockout experiments, highlighting its potential in antifungal drug development. The lack of vitro methods has hindered Pyst research, with diagnosis relying on microscopic detection in specimens. Combining in sil modelling and experimental phenotyping opens opportunities to release this bottleneck. The inability to culture Pyst has resulted in lack of data on composition, physiological characteristics, nutrient uptake, and enzymatic activities, hindering a comprehensive model development.
Researchers investigated whether increased levels of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcription coactivator with PD binding motif (TAZ) (YAP/TA) are sufficient to induce sustained proliferation in cancer cells under high-density conditions. They constructed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-Y/TA pathway, which regulates cell growth by inhibiting Y/TA activity. The model simulated cell-cell interactions using molecular dynamics (MD) and reaction equations, accounting for adhesion, repulsion, and friction forces between cells, and Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a soft core to prevent cell overlap. The model consisted of mitotic and growth phases, with cells dividing and growing under kinetic influence. Simulations at various Y/TA levels showed that a twofold increase in Y/TA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling continuous proliferation under high-density. This model, combining cell interactions and Hipp-YTA pathway, may evaluate cancer malignancy based on YTA levels, develop drugs to suppress abnormal proliferation, and determine drug dosages.
Researchers have investigated the role of low-complexity domains (LCD) in biomolecules, which have a tendency to form molecular condensates. Mutations in LCD can disrupt condens dynamics, leading to pathological transitions to solid-like states. To understand how LCD sequence governs condens dynamics, an energy framework was developed that operates on a'stickiness' scale rather than explicit sequence. Sequences were characterized by Wasserstein distance to shuffled counterparts. The framework maps material and dynamical properties governed by energy features modulated by LCD complexity, including periodicity and disorder. Periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. Results show minimum periodicity is crucial for fluidity, avoiding transitions to glass or solid states. The framework explains experimental findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condens viscoelasticity. A model, Free Landscape of Stickers (ELS), was introduced to investigate effects of low-complex patterns on condens dynamics and material properties. Structural and dynamical implications of patterns influence evolutionary development of phase-separ biomolecules. The study addresses the role of complexity in governing dynamics and material of biomolecular condates, providing a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties. Using ELS, the complexity of patterns, quantified by periodicity and disorder, impact dynamics and material of condates. The framework aligns with experimental findings on pr domains and predicts alterations in viscoelastic through periodic variations.
Researchers investigated the development of ectodermal organs, specifically focusing on the formation of stratified epithelial placodes that invaginate into the mesenchyme to form organs. They used the mouse dentition as a model and found that non-mus myosin II is essential for epithelial invagination, promoting cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by inducing myos II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AK and myos II rescued defects caused by inhibition of Sh. The study supports a model where Sh signal is transmitted through my II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination. Sh is required for narrowing the dental epithelium at the neck and proper invagination, and does so through promotion of My II activity. The Sh-PI/AKTMyII axis maintains cell-adhesion and promotes convergent cell movement driving epithelial invagination by strengthening adherens junctions and enabling convergent cell movement in the supasal layer. My II generates forces and maintains intercellular adhesion, perturbations in My mutants impede convergent narrowing and invagination. The study highlights the importance of My in maintaining cell-adhesion in stratified epithelium, consistent with prior findings that My-generated forces are essential for adherence in cultured cells.
Researchers have leveraged large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin accessibility data to gain insights into complex biological mechanisms. However, current label transfer methods have limitations in preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. To address this, a deep transfer-based graph convolutional network, scGCN, is proposed, achieving high performance in preserving biological variation and integrating thousands of cells in minutes with low memory. scGC is shown to integrate multimodal data from APS-se and C-se, demonstrating high transfer accuracy and knowledge across modalities. To reduce domain discrepancy and improve robustness, powerful transfer methods and generative models are needed. A single-cell graph convolutional network is proposed, considering transfer from RNA-se to AT-se as a domain adaptation problem in transfer learning. An efficient multistage learning strategy is used, integrating gene and chromatin data into a unified mouse atlas. The model aggregates cell relationships and expression with convolution, based on regulatory mechanisms between RNA and AT. MK-MD-based adaptation enables leveraging domain effects, and multiple kernels enhance adaption between embeddings. scGC accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets, tissues, species, and molecular layers, RNA-se and AT-se.
Researchers identified the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Mc3 subunit of the replicative helicase, a protein essential for cell growth, through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF) modeling. The NLS is rich in basic amino acids, but lacks a universally conserved sequence, making it challenging to identify. The study found that precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mc3 through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear import of Mc, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the M complex and poor growth. The results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, which retain shared characteristics between Mc3 and SV40 large antigen NLS. Further characterization of Mc's N will elucidate its cell-dependent nuclear import and loading, and refine predictions of other putative NLS in nuclear proteins. Mutagenesis studies identified basic residues in Mc's N critical for function, particularly P2 and P3, which interact with importin. Mutations at P2 or P result in defective import, chromatin association, and impaired growth. Unexpectedly, Mc3SV-NLS mutant fails to support import, despite AF predicting contacts with Kap at P and P. Constitutive localization observed in full-length and C-terminal Mc lacking this NES. Defective import may compromise MCM loading, leading to growth defects.
Ataxin-2 (ATN) is a protein implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism, and is a therapeutic target for ALS-related conditions. The protein functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and assembly of mR-granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm-like domain of At2 can stimulate mRNA translation and antagonize mR-grule assembly. This study advances previous findings through experiments on Drosoph and human Atin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified (TRIBE) and co-localization immunoprecipitation indicate the poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 is a major determinant of mRNA and protein of Atin-2 m-grules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila indicate the At-LS domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At2-induced cytotoxicity. The data propose howin interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of R-gran condensation as well as neurodegeneration.

Across species, Atin-2 has conserved regions: LSm (Sm), L-associated (SmAD), and P2 motif flanked by IDRs. Detailed in Doph has shown the c-terminal of At2 is required for R assembly into granules. This study further elaborates mechanisms of Atin functions in mRNA and R assembly. The P2 of Atin and interactions with AB are essential for gran but required to recruit At-target RNAs and protein intoin gran. Atin is a translational activator, repressor, facilitator, and stabilizer of associated RN. Previous work showed At mutants lacking IDR for gran in Doph and S cells were resistant to neurode. The L-domain antagonizes Atin formation. This study tested the conserved P2 ofin and its association with AB in process. Using Galts-controlled el-G4 to express At2P2AD in Doph brains, RNA-Seq identified RNAs in poly selected and compared with At procedures.
Researchers investigated the role of gene regulatory networks in the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different anatomical locations, specifically the extraocular muscles (EOM) and limb muscles. They used genetically modified mice to study the spatiotemporal roles of Pit2 and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of OM progenitor population. The study provided a comprehensive characterization of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages and identified differential states, dynamics, commitment, and quiescence of OM stem cells compared to limb muscles. Deletion of Pax in adult stem cells resulted in reduced stem cell numbers and impaired regeneration following injury, while Pax was dispensable for OM formation during embryonic development. However, presence of stem cells in OM postnatal Pax null mice and roles of Pax and Pit2 in these cells remained unresolved. Expression of Pit2 in postnatal stem cells was higher in OM than limb muscles. Despite uniform acquisition of myogenic fate, heterogeneity characterized embryonic cells in anatomical locations. Conditional inactivation Pit2 in neural-crest cells did not affect OM specification but resulted in muscle patterning defects. Temporal requirement for Pit2 during lineage was demonstrated: deletion in progenitors resulted in absence myofib and cells, while in mylast did not. In trunk, both deromyome and limb, expression Pax and My5 preceded Pax, with Pax rapidly downregulated during myogenic commitment. Following establishment muscle anlagen, Pax was expressed mid-embry in undifferentiated population and persisted to adult stem. The study proposes a relay between Pit2, My5, and Pax for OM cell maintenance.
Researchers have developed a novel algorithm called VOC-IN to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants among the human population. The algorithm combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. VOC-IN emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve optimization and achieve accurate fitting. Variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease severity, immune capabilities, and responsiveness to treatments, necessitating public health measures. To evaluate risk, simulating transmission within the population and time-dependent characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 variants is crucial.

The researchers integrated Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PIN) with infectious models, particularly VOC-IN, to capture the time-vary nature of parameters. Studies have shown PIN can accurately fit compartment models and estimate time-vary parameters. The proposed VOC-IN method fits data and infers time-vary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiological mechanisms, and Ordinary Differential Equations into neural networks. Experiments demonstrated VOC-IN accurately fits reported data from British Columbia and Canadian health agencies, simulates unobserved dynamics, and enables short-term predictions. Results reveal variations in control strategies across regions. VOC-IN performs well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data.
Researchers have developed a new method called CytoNet, a deep learning-based approach that improves the accuracy of image-based cell profiling by 30-68% compared to the traditional method of averaging cell populations. This is because averaging fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. CytoNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple instance learning framework, making it easier to apply to single-cell data than previous strategies. The model achieves this by downweighting small cells or debris and prioritizing crowded cells. It only requires perturbation labels for training, which are available in all profiling datasets. CytoNet offers a post-processing step for single profiles that significantly boosts performance on image-based datasets. 

CytoNet is a self-supervised contrast learning approach that leverages information in profiling experiments. Contrast learning brings similar data together while pushing others apart in a space, capturing general features for tasks. Here, it's applied to single features, not raw pixels, making it applicable to most profiling datasets. Data is treated as a collection of sets, where each sample corresponds to a set based on mathematical definition. Deep Sets are used to learn a model that aggregates data into a profile, outperforming population-averaged in predicting a compound's mechanism.
Researchers have proposed a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The framework relies on identifying discrete dynamical states (microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate its effectiveness, they applied it to a dataset collected during a spatial Stro task, a cognitive test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting aspect. Results showed increased cost linked to cognitive effort, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions. The study highlights the value of characterizing brain dynamics and costs in understanding cognitive processes and the relationship between neural patterns, effort, and performance. A stochastic framework was employed to measure brain cost in an existing EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and demand during the Stro task. This is the first application of the framework to EEG data, providing a pipeline to quantify demand in EEG experiments. The method was generalized to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly than functional MRI. An EEG dataset was analyzed on participants performing the Stro task. A previous approach was applied to fMRI of participants performing cognitive tasks, showing transition from resting to tasks varies, proposing this method for neurophysiological data. However, tasks were qualitatively different and difficult to compare, no prior expectations of difficulty and expected demand. This study investigates changes during tasks and if cost explains brain energy needs for differing demands. Other metrics quantify loads from microanalysis, such as entropy or Hurst exponents, lack interpretation regarding costs, not accounting dynamics.
Researchers investigated the role of atypical memory B cells (aBC) in the immune response to Plasmodium vivax (P. viv) malaria infection. They generated probes to detect and study the development and persistence of P. viv-specific aBC and their ability to produce neutralizing antibodies. The study found that P. viv infections elicited the development and persistence of P. viv-specific aBC, which accumulated during and after infections and might play a role in producing antibodies against malaria. Among the aBC clones, A12 and B11 produced neutralizing antibodies against a panel of P. viv variants. Notably, the B cell receptors of P. viv-specific aBC expressed unique IGH genes, similar to classical BC. The somatic hypermutation rate and CDR length of VH and V in these BC subsets were not different. The findings revealed that P. viv infections elicited the development and persistence of P. viv aBC and the accumulation of aBC during infections might play an important role in producing antibodies against malaria. The study also demonstrated the generation of antigen-specific aBC in P. viv infections and their ability to secrete antibodies against variant antigens. The expansion of aBC in malaria has been reported, but their competency to differentiate into ASC for secreting anti-malaria antibodies was unknown. The study used single BC cultures to demonstrate P. viv-specific aBC function in differentiation. The results showed that P. viv-infected individuals with first clinical symptoms developed antigen aBC and acquisition of aBC responses was not associated with repeated or chronic exposure to parasites.
Researchers have developed a new method called MR-MASHS, an extension of the MR-MASH model, that uses summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel instead of individual-level data. This makes MRASH more applicable to datasets that are not publicly available and scalable to biob-size data. Simulations showed that MRASHS is competitive and often outperforms current methods for single and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios with different patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, number of variants, and heritability. A real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UKBiobank showed MRASH achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for most traits, especially with smaller sample size datasets. MRASH requires individual data due to privacy concerns and doesn't scale to large datasets like biobanks, limiting its use in polygenic prediction. MRASHS addresses these limitations by using summary statistics and LD estimates from a reference panel.
Researchers have developed a novel modeling framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases by incorporating spatial and temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models. They introduced a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles and approximated the recruitment rate using a neural network to develop a Universal Differential Equation (DE) model. The model was trained using deep learning methods and calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods with data from the COVID-19 Omic variant outbreak in Shanghai. The model projected an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to homogeneous model projections of 99.97 and 32.78%, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. Simulations showed heterogeneity decreased herd immunity by 37.36% and prolonged the outbreak by 30-70 days, aligning with real data. The study lays groundwork for a new class of models and insights on heterogeneity.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain exhibit high levels of noise, which is surprising given their high energy consumption. They propose that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework was developed, where the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by a learning rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms. Synapses utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. Each syn predicts somatic dynamics, but emergent dynamics of many synapses in a network solve problems like classification and closed-loop control in dynamic environments. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties in network behaviorally ambiguous situations.

The study shows synapses can exploit transmission to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. A model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode somatic potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity in post-spike protocols and weight dependence. A synaptic learning rule was derived by minimizing surprise in synapses, adapting efficacy to predict postsyn spikes by backpropagating action potentials. Synaptic variability can reflect uncertainty in firing. Postsyn learns to fire according to Gaussian distributions with different spreads. Variability in firing is reflected in spiking learning. During stochastic firing, high trial-to-trial variability in membrane dynamics is observed. Synapses learn suitable responses as a problem in unknown environment, variability representing uncertainty about cellular state.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scup for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method addresses challenges of single-cell sequencing such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scup computes distances between cells and uses the neighbor-joining algorithm to reconstruct the tree. It is designed to be embarrassingly parallel, making it faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. The method's robustness is tested on synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells. Single-cell sequencing enables detailed analysis of development and differentiation. Reconstructing lineage from single cells is a fundamental problem with potential for studies of development and differentiation. There are two related problems for cancer: reconstruction of clonal trees and tumor phylogenies from single cells. Data types such as bulk, single DNA, single DNA, and RNA have been used for these problems. However, mutations are scarce when reconstructing lineage for healthy tissues, implying sophisticated models and methods are needed. Single DNA sequencing data reveals more mutations than other types, but comes with challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scup is a distance-based method that reconstructs lineage from DNA data produced by amplification methods like MDA and MALAC. It distinguishes somatic mutations from sequencing errors caused by amplification. A dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage topology is used to test the method. These cells are closely related, making it hard to reconstruct the true tree.
In low-income settings, healthcare systems face challenges in allocating limited resources to improve population health outcomes. Health benefits packages (HBPs) are used to determine which services the public healthcare system should provide, but analytic approaches to weigh evidence for interventions have limitations. This study proposes the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model, a tailored tool for evaluating Malawi HBs, addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modeling and calibrating country-specific data on disease incidence, health behavior, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under resource constraints, the authors simulated health gains under plausible HBP strategies. A linear optimization-based HBP achieved an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 compared to a benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, it incurred excess DALs in the first years. Other prioritization approaches, such as patient characteristics-based, achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark and a 5% reduction over the period, suggesting this approach may be beneficial. The LO model provides a tool to test HBs specifically for Malawi, evaluating health gains through prioritizing services under realistic resource constraints, addressing limitations in other methods. Failure to capture effects results in overestimating health delivered by the system. This approach provides a balanced representation of Malawi's healthcare constraints and postpones analysis of factors to later work.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpella and compared them to the silkworm moth Bomby mor, which diverged over 100 million years ago. Using oligo DNA FISH, they found that meiotic homolog pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to previous studies in Bomby mor. Both species form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bomby, Plodia orients bivalents in multiple ways at metaph I. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the chromosome center, regardless of bivalent position, and are not paired, with four distinct kinetochores observed at metaph I. Microtubule attachments orient separated kinchores. These findings challenge the classical view of paired, pole-facing kinchores for accurate hom separation in meiosis. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model organisms, revealing novel biology.
Researchers have investigated the role of the median eminence (ME), a region at the base of the hypothalamus, in the development of hypopituitarism, a condition where the pituitary gland does not produce sufficient hormones. They found that mutations affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox lead to hypopuitarism, likely originating from the hypothalamus. The study shows that absence of SOX3 primarily affects the median eminence, causing phenotypes that appear in juvenile animals despite embryonic SO3 expression in the pituitary. Reduced hormone levels correlate with lack of endocrine cell maturation, while NG-glia renewal and oligodrocy differentiation are also affected. Treatment with low-dose aspirin, known to affect NG-glia, rescues proliferative defects and hypopuitar in SO3 mutants. The study highlights a central role of NG-glia in ME during postnatal development and sensitivity to extrinsic signals. NG-g in ME are mostly affected by SO3 loss, their proliferation corrected by lowose aspir or gut microbiota changes. Sufficient NG-g are required in ME to support pituitary maturation as the animal becomes weaning. The study reveals a novel role of NG-g in post-we formation of functional ME and control of pitary maturation, a robust phenotype due to SO3 loss modified by non-gen factors.
Researchers investigated the role of the protein F-act in C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis and identified GTPase CED-10/Rac as an essential activator of F-act. However, they needed to identify the GEF that activates C-10/Rac during embryonic cell migrations. The two-component GEF, CED-5/C-12, is known to activate C-10ac to promote cell movements resulting in corpse engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis and later migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell. They tested if C-5/C-12 was involved in embryonic migrations and got a contradictory result: C-5/C12 supported embryonic migrations, but inhibited F-act in the epidermis, opposite of what was expected for C10 GEF. To address how C-12/C5 could have opposing effects on-act during corpsement and migration, they investigated if C12 harbors GAP functions. A GAP region in C12 away from the C5 catalytic region was mutated, altering epider cell function and not corpsement. Interfering with GEF by C5's ability to bind Rac1/C10 resulted in loss of ventral enclosure and corpsement. Genetic studies support GAP acts on different Gases. They propose C-5/C12 support cycling multiple Gases using distinct domains to promote and inhibit-act nucleation.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the rodent visual system using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis. They found that information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increased along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. In contrast, intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic recurrent network model with correlated input reproduced these observations, suggesting that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. 

The study used predict and timescales to probe hierarchical processing in mouse cortex, finding a gradual increase in times following the anatomical hierarchy had more predictive power for both correlation and timescales. This suggests a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in visual cortex. An alternative hypothesis is that recurrence enables longer integration of information, thought to cause long times in primates. However, feedforward processing predicts higher times and hierarchy under stimulation with natural movies compared to spontaneous activity without a visual stimulus. Modeling results indicate that decrease in predict can be caused by increase recurrent, as stronger coupling reduces temporal correlations from stimuli. Decrease in predict may also reflect efficient coding, where processing removes redundancy in spike trains.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications, but the neural circuits engaged during T are poorly understood. Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct read of the response of motor cortex to T, offering an opportunity to model neural dynamics. This study used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of motor cortical macrocolumn, investigating mechanisms underlying response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves. Sensitivity analysis identified important pathways and machine learning identified common features among pathways. Sensitivity analysis revealed neuron types preferentially contributing to corticosp waves, with single wave latency predicted by average probability of paths between activated neuron and layer 5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Conduction delay of shortest path to PT determined latency of cortic wave. Multiple neuron activations preferentially modulated cortic waves, supporting hypothesis different pathways contribute with excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to motor cortex and specific neuron types initiated I-waves, interpreted to propose origins of afferents giving rise to Iaves. Methodology provides workflow for computationally tractable sensitivity on complex models relating structure to identify mechanisms of response to acute stimulation.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfDNA) is present in the maternal circulation throughout gestation and has been detected as early as the fourth week of pregnancy, comprising approximately 40% of total plasma-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cfDNA has been used in clinical non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploies. However, the biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, limiting research and clinical utility. This review examines current knowledge of cfDNA, including origins and characteristics, highlighting gaps in knowledge and future directions. cfDNA is shed into maternal circulation throughout pregnancy and has been used in NI to screen for common aneupies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 by assessing overrepresentation of affected chromosomes in plasma-free DNA. The effectiveness of NI for anup screening has been reviewed elsewhere. cfDNA is representative of the placental genome, providing a means for non-invasive genome characterization of the placenta. This opens avenues for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, currently hindered by ethical and availability of early and mid-gestation samples. cfDNA can be a powerful tool for studying placental health and disease, beyond current NI repertoire, which is limited to genetic screening the fetus.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the shared genetic risk factors among hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers. They found that risk variants for these cancers cluster in specific regions of the genome, contrasting with genetically unrelated traits. The study identified 44 multi-DC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping regions with risk for at least two HDCs, with two regions containing risk for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDC, and 28 for two HDC. Integrating genome-wide data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter Hi-C maps from diverse cell models, they annotated 53 candidate genes at multi-DC risk regions. These targets were enriched with established cancer genes from the COSMIC Cancer Census, but had previously unreported pleiotropic roles. Additionally, they pinpointed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential HDC targets and identified risk in regions that altered transcription motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known targets were overrepresented among candidate multi-DC genes, implying some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or repurposing existing treatments for HDC. The study provides a framework for identifying common genes driving complex traits and understanding HDC susceptibility.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic cause of polymyositis in the Kiker dog breed, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by muscle inflammation. The study involved 33 cases and 106 controls, and identified a significant association with a region on chromosome 19. Further analysis revealed a 2.9 Mb region shared by cases in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The deletion frequency was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random Kiker breed sample. Leukocytes from affected dogs homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL2 upon mitogen stimulation. The study suggests elements 10-49 upstream of the IL/IL locus regulate the genes and deletion is a risk factor for polymositis in Kiker. Estimated penetrance was 10-20 for homozygous and 0.5-2 for heterozygous dogs. The results indicate variants may be found at least 10 kb upstream of the IL gene. The study demonstrates involvement of the ILIL locus in polymositis, but the responsible element and function in inflammatory processes are unknown.
Researchers have developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 protein domains. The model can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations, and performs reasonably well on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distant from the training set. Training on an ensemble of protein domains instead of a single domain improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein model for stability prediction. However, the model lags behind state-of-the-art in generalizing to longer protein sequences. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths observed in nature. The researchers fine-tuned ESM-2 to predict the folding of small protein domains, which generalizes to domains outside the training set, reducing experimental burden. The model, ESMm, performs comparably to state-of-the-art and generalizes to small sequences distant from the training set, with a p-value of 2x-2. However, the margin is slim, with 72% of domains having a Spearman's correlation change of 0.1. The model is limited to sequences longer than 72 residues in length, so it was benchmarked on stability datasets of larger proteins and compared to state-the methodologies.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIR) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1). They hypothesized that in autoimmunity, where an enhanced T cell response is detrimental, iIR would have an opposite effect compared to their role in chronic infections. The study found that iIR genes, in the presence of their ligands, have a significant and consistent effect on HLA class II genetic associations in a case-control T1 dataset (N=11,961). This effect was validated in an independent dataset. The results suggest that iIR decrease HLA class II protective associations and regulate CD4 T responses in T1. iIR are a family of inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and late-differentiated T cells, with HLA I molecules as ligands. The impact of functional iIR on H associations has not been studied. The researchers postulated that given their impact on adaptive responses in chronic infections, iIR might play a role in autoimm. Associations between H class II genes and T1 are clear that CD4 T play a role in T. They hypothesized if iIR modulate CD4 cell, this should manifest as iIR modulation H II genetic.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is an age-related cause of vision loss and the most common expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of FE cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CT repeat (CT18.1) within the ubiquously expressed factor encoding gene T4. The nonoding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. This study comprehensively describes CT18.1-driven molecular components in primary-derived coral endothelial cells from a cohort of individuals with CT18-expanded and CT-independent FE. Long-read, short, and transcript techniques interrogate expansion-specific biomarkers. Analysis reveals altered splicing within FE and transcripts associated with CT18-expans. Differential expression highlights transcript consequences within FE cells. Exon usage, pathway, and spatial reveal T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential consequences. Exome data from FE cases identified rare and potentially deleterious T4 variants, suggesting T4-independent may increase FE risk. This study supports hypothesis that distinct mechanisms, RNA and T4 iso-specific dysregulation underpin FE pathophysiology.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice (Oryza sativa) to improve direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) qLT11 from variety Arroz da, which shows rapid germination at lower temperatures using QTL-seq. The candidate region was delineated to a 52-kb interval containing the REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during seed germination. The Arroz Terra GFh allele encodes functional GFh, whereas Japanese variety Hitome has a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Ar da allele decreased LT, while overexpressing functional GFh in Hitb increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal gene behind qLT. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functional GFh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. A NIL in Hitb background with 172b genomic fragment from Ar da including GFh showed superior LT to Hitb with comparable agronomic traits. The GFh from Ar da represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers investigated the structure of hepatitis B virus (HBV) relaxed circular (rc) DNA and its conversion to covalently closed (cc) DNA. They introduced a mutation in the 3' terminal redundancy (TR) of the negative DNA strand, which is derived from the reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), to study whether it forms a 5' or 3' flap structure and is removed during ccDNA formation. A mutant HBV cell line, HepDES182G, was created with a C2G mutation in the pgRNA sequence, altering the 3' TR, while the 5 TR remained wild type. Production of HBrc and ccDNA in HepDES2 cells was comparable to wild-type levels. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the positive strand of rcDNA and both strands of ccDNA predominantly carried the wild-type 182 residue, indicating the 5 TR of the negative strand serves as the template during rc replication, forming a duplex with the positive strand, while the 3 TR forms a flap structure, which is removed during cc formation. A survey of cellular endonucleases showed that Mus81 plays a role in cc formation in wild-type HB replicating cells, alongside 5 endonuclease F1. Mus and F1 cleavage sites in the TR of rcDNA were mapped by RACE sequencing. The function between Mus and F1 in cc formation indicates the putative 5 and 3 flaps are dynamically interchangeable on rc precursors.
Researchers developed a microbe-micro interaction genome-scale model (mmEM) to study the adaptation of microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide wastewater from a cannedine factory. The model encompassed three microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). Simulations revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as organic rates increased, with a decline in FC performance. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low and high rates. Simulations showed SO growth constraints under high due to reduced-sulfide cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating dominance. Cross-feeding dynamics under varying rates enabled scenario-based simulations to explore acidity impact on SO growth and FC performance. This work highlights metabolic in shaping community response to high rates. Insights inform effective strategies for FC implementation in industrial environments.
Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to guide biological discovery in medicine, such as prioritizing promising molecules in drug discovery. ML models predict properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates for experimental validation. However, when applied to new situations, these models can be overconfident and produce many false positives. To address this, a solution is to quantify model uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) specified by researchers. A proposed is C, an ML framework for DR-controlled discovery. It integrates a deep model with a statistical tool as conform prediction, providing accurate DR-controlled predictions for a protein. Conform prediction provides statistical guarantees the model will not exceed a user-specified DR with high probability. Experiments show C achieves reliable DR, comparable performance at lower DR than existing methods, and predictions for underrepresented in data. C is expected to be a tool for discovery where high validation is desired but budget is limited.

A proposed framework, C, leverages the conform framework to achieve DR functions, and developed a deep model as the base model (Fig 1). When situations, models without uncertainty are susceptible to overconf predictions, misdirecting efforts to false hypotheses. Addressing becomes essential ensure efficiency of ML-assisted discovery. Presented is C, an that enables DR-assisted discoveries. Leveraging conform, allows users specify DR, tailored goals and predictions with DR. Demonstrated effectiveness using function as a case, simulating process identifying less-character enzymes.

Machine play a role in generating hypotheses for analyses and facilitating discoveries various. A in ML-assisted discoveries is the of models with quantification predictions. For example, has a strategy for screening, use models to properties, and identify candidates for validation and optimization.
Researchers have identified hyperphosphorylated T-43 as a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in most patients. Mutations in the TARDB gene, which codes for T-43, cause some familial ALS cases, indicating T-43 dysfunction drives disease. Aggregated phosphorylated T-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes, or T-43 aggregation may be a protective response sequestering protein from the cell. The heat shock chaper H90 interacts with T-43 and stabilizes its conformation, but its role in neurotoxicity in vivo is unknown. Using a C. elegans model of mutant T-43opathy, researchers found that loss of H90 protects against T- neuroxicity and neurodegeneration, accompanied by decreased total and phosphorylated T-43. H90 also upregulates stress responsive heat pathway genes, including H70 and H16.1, and normal H16.1 levels are required for H90 effects on T43. The neuroprotective effect of H90 does not involve proteasome regulation in C. elegans. This study demonstrates H90 chaper activity contributes to adverse outcomes in T- proteinopathies in a whole animal model of ALS.
Researchers have created a comprehensive atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system using single-nucle RNA and ATAC sequencing, shedding light on the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and cellular identity in this species. The study aimed to address the limited understanding of these processes in arthropods due to the focus on model systems like Drosophila and Daphnia, which do not reflect the diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex systems. The atlas identified major cell types in the Artemia ovary, including germ, follicle, and muscle cells, and explored gene regulation of the chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and the presence of meiotic sex silencing in this group. 

 Single-nucle RNA sequencing resolved the complexity of the Artemia ovary, identifying clusters with distinct expression patterns sharing homology with Dophila clusters from the Fly Atlas, suggesting conserved expression programs for cellular identity and function. Clusters were mapped to Doph ovary from Fly Atlas using SAM, supporting high conservation of molecular pathways defining identity in ovary. 

10x single-nucle RNA experiments on ovaries from mated and unmated females, and 10xome AT+ expression on ovar from unmated females were performed to resolve cellular heterogeneity and chromatin accessibility in cell types. The study of meiotic sex regulation in heterametic system is a step in this direction, and highlights singleucle RNA as an alternative to traditional approaches for meiotic regulation in species difficult to isolate meiotic cells.
Chronic pain is a widespread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States around $600 billion in 2010. A common symptom of chronic pain is allodynia, where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The specific mechanisms remain unclear, but allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This study analyzes biophysically-motcircuit structures that represent motifs in neural circuits laminae-II of the dorsal horn, hypothesized to be part of pathways mediating two types of allody: static and dynamic. Neural rate models describe activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. Sensitivity analysis identifies mechanisms likely causing allody-producing dysregulation of subc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation inhibitory signaling or upregulation excitatory responses. Mechanisms, subcircuits involved, and proportion vary depending on subc structure. Results suggest diverse mechanisms may be responsible for allody, offering predictions for variability and targets for experimental studies. 

The study identifies multiple excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in dorsal circuits, suggesting dysreg may occur through mechanisms dependent on injury. Modeling interactions among interuron populations for E balance in healthy conditions and allody is a first step. Painful stimuli activate excitatory cells and downstream neurons, gated by inhib populations under healthy conditions. Allody occurs when E balance disrupted, non-pain input causes excitatory firing, activating downstream neurons. Treatment of chronic pain requires understanding causes. Dysregulation E in dorsal circuit is a cause supported by preclinical studies, but understanding circuit complexity leaves questions how dysreg occurs. This study describes subc motifs mediating static and dynamic allody, including spiking properties in rate networks.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in the function of eukary elongation factor 2 (EF2), a crucial for protein translation and ribosome translocation. They found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF2, with some mutations in Hsp or cochones reducing EF levels and growth, while others affecting sensitivity to diphther toxin, a post-translational modification of EF2. The study suggests H90 contributes to proteostasis not only by protein folding but also by enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. Hsp mutants were linked to subsets of cochones, indicating distinct versions of the H90 pathway for different clients. H1 was identified as a protein bridging EF with C1 and Hsp or TRC, and further studies are needed to understand its interaction with EF and TRC and H90. EF folding was measured by steady-state levels and susceptibility to dther toxin, showing H and cochones have distinct roles in mediating EF function. One goal is to identify how clients interact with H and cochones for selective inhibition of H90. Saccharomy cerevisiae H90 has two isoforms, 97% identical, and EF two isoforms 100% identical.
Researchers investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, regions involved in decision-making, made choices in a gambling task with and after observing others' choices. Participants in both groups showed disrupted use of utility-based computations for risky options, but for socially situated decisions, they increased conformity with others' choices, independent of utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may serve as a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted. The study aimed to understand how decisions are made when preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, such as in individuals with certain psychopathologies or novel options. Previous research focused on how social information contributes to choices with respect to individuals' preferences about risk. The study used a decision task to examine whether heuristics facilitate situated decision-making about risk when utility is disrupted. Individuals with insula or dACC lesions exhibited disrupted utility-based risk processing and used social information from others to guide decisions. Findings suggest conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based information in socially situated decision-making when individuals' risk processing is impaired. A parametric relationship was found between degree of impairment and use of 'others' choices heuristic, with those most disrupted in utility-based decision conforming most to others' choices. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample, providing convergent evidence for a trade-off between utility processes and cognitively demanding heuristics facilitating risky options in social context.
Researchers have applied Richard Dawkins' iconic model of morphological evolution, known as biomorphs, to demonstrate how developmental bias influences adaptive outcomes in evolution. They found that biomorphs exhibit phenotypic bias, where certain phenotypes are significantly more likely to appear through random mutations, with a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low complexity. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle, similar to evolution searching in a space of algorithms. Simulations show that moderately frequent phenotypic variation can fix at the expense of highly adaptive biomorphs that are less frequent. Results resemble patterns in molecular-genotype maps, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained genome sections explains these patterns. The authors postulate that bias towards simplicity and other biom patterns may hold in developmental systems. 

Biomorphs, created as a simplified description of morph development, show simplicity bias beyond molecular scale, prompting the question of whether simplicity is general in development. The study aims to analyze phenotypic variation systematically and test the hypothesis that biomorph exhibits simplicity and phenomena similar to molecular maps. Under sequence-constraint conditions provide a useful approximation, whether conditions hold in maps is a future research topic. Simulations show phenotyp bias influences evolution when phenotypes convey advantage, the frequent and simpler is more likely to evolve. Correlations between phenotyp changes and fitness are what Dawkins exploited in The Watchmaker, making incremental changes to evolve high-complex structures.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems by having participants interact with a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick. The study consisted of three experiments where participants hit targets aligned with or offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. Results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize the pendulum's motion close to the N, even when targets were not aligned with it. For increased accuracy, participants adjusted arm stiffness to align resonant motions with the task. This study extends existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems, demonstrating capabilities to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions, possibly through muscle stiffness changes. A numerical tool was used to compute nonlinear modes (N) of the energy-conservative systems, allowing comparison with human motions. The pendulum was excited in various ways, not automatically falling to its N, and participants stabilized on a trajectory close to it by exploiting intrinsic dynamics. The study supports human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, intuitively exciting and stabilizing motions close to N, even when not aligned with it.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in responding to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude. The transition from exponential to stationary phase is controlled by a group of transcription factors called transition regulators (TSRs), which influence developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. However, the extent of TSR influence on bacterial physiology is not fully understood. This study demonstrates that two TSRs, Sco and Abr, along with Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate iron chelator pulerrin production in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis shows that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence rate and amount produced. Expression of pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is under control of Sco, Abr, and PR, and correlated with pulerr produced. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. Regulation by two distinct systems underscores pulerr's role in B. subtilis physiology.

Biochemical analysis shows regulators of pulerr biosynthesis operon and TSRs Sco and Abr bind yC promoter with differing affinities. Results indicate pulerr regulation in B. subtilis is under tight repression during exponential growth by two systems. TSR Sco and Abr have been studied for diverse aspects of B. subtilis physiology, including sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm. Microarray analysis of effect of Sco on global expression was carried out in cells at different growth points in media.

Further roles of PR and Abr in regulation were established using DNA assays and evidence Sco binds yC in vitro. Results establish model where pulerr biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during transition to stationary in addition to PR, linking stationary with extracellular sequestration. PR and Abr act as roadblocks to RNAP at yC. Sco involves direct and indirect regulation through another factor modulating Sco. Presence of three repressors is necessary to limit pul production, providing insight into regulatory network of production in bacteria.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how spinal cord injuries (SCI) affect bladder function and how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve it. The model replicates the loss of coordinated control between the detrusor muscle, bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic muscles after SCI, leading to detrusor-sphinct dyssyria or incontinence. The model shows that T applied to the spinal cord after SCI can reduce inence. It incorporates the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic bladder dysfunction after SCI and additional neurophysiological features to replicate improvements in bladder function with lumbar T in patients with SCI. A computational model of the neural circuit of mictition based on Hodgkin-Hux equations replicated normal bladder function, added interneurons and network to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after SCI, and increased density and complexity of interactions of inhibitory and excitatory lumbar interneurons to provide diverse responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of interneurons after SCI. The model reproduced re-emergence of spinal voiding after SCI. Low-frequency TMS (1Hz) normalized voiding after SCI, while high-frequency T (30Hz) enhanced urine storage.
Researchers have proposed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from optical density (OD) data, a common in microbiology laboratory measurement, for Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus. The model accounts for OD being an indirect measure by relating it to true fungal growth, eliminating the need for calibration data generation. The method outperformed reference models in fitting and predicting OD growth curves, resolving discrepancies between morphology-specific rates from OD versus measured data. The model treats OD as a variable distributed around a linear transform of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. It was evaluated using time-course OD data for A. fumatus and estimated morphology growth rates from directly measured data. This model is accessible to all microbiology labs collecting OD data, not just specialist labs with automated methods. Instead of directly measuring growth, indirect measures like OD can be used for rate estimation or mechanistic modeling. The study aimed to model filamentous growth and estimate morphology rates from OD at 600nm without calibration, considering OD's indirect nature. Calibration data for bacteria cannot be reused for fungi due to size and shape sensitivity. Directly fitting fungal growth to OD resulted in misfit and lower rates compared to direct measures.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes, with most species having XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination mechanisms also present in some groups. A whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confus, with a neo-sex chromosome, and eleven additional beetle genomes were used to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. Ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, share conserved genes across beet. The ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beet, but independent autosomes are added to the ancestral chromosomes. Neo-sex chromosomes evolve stereotypical properties of sex, including dosage compensation and non-random gene expression. Beet provide a model to understand diverse forces driving chromosome evolution.

A phylogenetic sampling of beet suggests they are a promising model to study kary evolution and forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing kary evolution study at molecular level. The X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple neo-chromosomes formed among closely related species. Comparative analysis addresses prevalence and driving forces across species. Genomic approaches reconstruct kary evolution Cole. A new chromosome assembly for Tribium confus and published assemblies from eleven species across phylog, reconstruct sex and kary evolution (Fig 1). Parthenogenesis found in 7% species, fusions between chromosomes autosomes reported, creating neo-chromosomes. Beetle kary typically from testis, reported XY, X0, Xy. Chromosomal sex conserved across beet, but sex identity unclear. Dipt have XY, genomic diversity in kary among flies, transitions, autos into sex. Abundance beet and tools make Cole a model study mechanisms and forces sex differentiation taxa.
Researchers investigated the role of histone variant H2 (H2) in gene regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H2 is encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene and is evolutionarily conserved, and predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-complex (SW-C). While H2 has been implicated in transcription regulation, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, growth defects of ht mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW-C subunits, suggesting SW-C's deleterious activity when missing H2 substrate (apoSW-C). H mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions, and a more substantial role in gene regulation may be uncovered under stress. To explore this, mRNA profiles were generated for wild, ht, sw, and htsw mutants before and after hydroxyurea (H) exposure, which induces DNA stress. Data showed H played a prominent role in activation during H exposure and was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. Apo-SW contributed to defects in ht, particularly genes in phosphate homeostasis. H incorporation before and after H treatment revealed decreases at transcription sites correlated with upregulation during exposure. This study characterized the effects of H incorporation during transcriptional response H.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology, but classifying transcriptomic profiles from scRNA experiments into cell types and identifying individual cell lineages is challenging due to the accumulation of datasets and high dimensionality of data. To overcome this, automated methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training, but obtaining annotated single-cell data is difficult, so a partial learning framework is proposed, assuming a set of candidate labels for each data point, a simpler setting than fully supervised. State-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble, are extended to partial learning. The effect of label structure on methods is studied, particularly hierarchical, as observed in developmental processes. Simulated and real datasets show extensions enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly with prototype-based methods. Performances with partially annotated data reach fully supervised levels. Uncertainty in partially annotated data is studied, deriving prescriptive results on effect on accuracy. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying on less stringent annotated datasets than fully learning.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets, and its involvement in RNA polymerase II transcription. They found that PIP localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA and identified proteins that associate with PIP in a RNA-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, they unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP-associated (RD) proteome in human cells, revealing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with basic PIP-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. These IDRs exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The study showed that Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with P2 in a RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and altered P2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BR4. The results propose that P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins, affecting their ability to form foci via phase separation, suggesting a pivotal role in establishing functional nuclear architecture for gene expression.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, specifically the Scarabinae clade, known for their diversified development of novel secondary sexual traits such as horns. They generated chromosome-level genome assemblies of three Onthagini tribe species and compared them to seven other Coleoptera species, identifying changes in coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation and metamorphosis. Chromatin accessibility in developing horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition males and females revealed distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition-responsive development, including recently evolved elements sensitive to horn determination. Binding of known and candidate transcription factors were enriched in nutrition-open chromatin regions. The study highlights chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating gene networks highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides reference genomes for three species bolstering future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies.
Researchers investigated the pathogenesis of Lassa fever using a cynomolg monkey model of Lassa virus (LAS) infection, reproducing different disease outcomes. Histological and transcriptomic studies revealed dynamics of LASV infection and immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs were an early reservoir for replicating virus, with LAS entering the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, viral tropism varied with severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid organs and immune cells in non-fatal Lassa, but systemic dissemination to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and excessive response in fatal outcome. The study aimed to model fatal and non-fatal Lassa in cynolg monkey, showing SLOs as early reservoirs for LAS replication in infected animals, irrespective of severity. Cell tropism, dissemination, and immune infiltration differed between disease outcomes. A cynolg monkey model reproduced outcomes of Lassa in humans, infecting with Jos and AV strains of LAS at same dose and route leading to fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. Analysis of these strains shed light on Lassa pathogenesis and immune mechanisms. Replication in SLO followed systemic dissemination to all organs in severe Lassa, whereas restricted to few in surviving animals.
Researchers have investigated the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). They found that disruptions in the localization of nuclear pore proteins, transport receptors, Ran-GTP, and RanGAP are present in both familial and sporadic forms of these diseases. However, it is unclear whether these alterations are a primary cause or consequence of the disease. The study used two novel mouse models of neurodegeneration, NemR86 and NemR87, which recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, and found an Import-β-specific nuclear block. They also observed cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in pathogenesis of ALS/FT and AD/AD, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran. These findings were supported by a pathological interaction between Importβ and mutant Nem86 protein in cytoplasm accumulations. The study identified transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogenerative disease and showed that transient inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induced proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in mouse models. Convergent results between mouse and human and neuronal nonuronal biology provide mechanistic evidence that mislocalized and dysregulated events in multiple neurogener diseases may arise from primary defect Importβ import.
Researchers have explored the potential of bacteriophages in medical and biotechnological applications, requiring a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms. CRISPR-Cas systems enable site-specific phage mutagenesis, but phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagen efficiency. A study utilized the eukotic enzyme NgET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Casuc cleavage and enhancing mutagen efficiency. This approach enables precise targeting and seamless mutation, exemplified by deactivating AD-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Temporarily removing modifications elucidated the effects on T4 phage infections without necessitating deletions. The study presents a strategy for investigating phage epigen functions and streamlining phages with cytosine DNA. Temporal modulation of the phage epigen is valuable for synthetic biology and research comprehending phage mechanisms through mutant generation.
The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with processes such as transcription and replication. Multiple mechanisms act in concert to ensure DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV or DNA-damaging agent 4-nitrooline, act as transcription and replicational roadblocks and represent a threat to cell metabolism. When located on transcribed of active genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision (TCER), an incompletely understood ER-path. Using a genetic screen in yeast Saccharces cerevisiae, histone variant H2 was identified as important for transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In absence of H2, repair by TCER is impaired and RNAase II clearance reduced, leading to increase in double-strand breaks. Thus, H is for TCER and plays major role in maintenance genome stability upon irradiation. Our finding that histone H is required for TCER contributes to prevention of UV-induced Ds highlights significance of repair-optimized chromatin in genomic stability.
Researchers analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malighian tub as well as microbiome in the gut of two Drosoph melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. They found extensive tissue and genetic-specific effects, with tissue-specific effects stronger than genetic-specific effects. Examination of allele expression revealed both cis and trans effects more tissue-specific in expressed between populations than conserved genes, with trans effects more-specific than cis. Despite highly variable architecture, this was robust across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting trans variation can be fine-tuned as well as cis during divergence. Transcript data from parental and F1 D melanogaster from ancestral and derived populations midut, hind, and Maligh tub showed genetic basis variation (cis versus trans) and mode inheritance (dominant versus additive) highly tissue and background-specific. Gene expression was similar between Maligh tub and midut, despite being part excret and digestive system, while gut part alimentary canal. Overall, findings demonstrate functionally interconnected tissues can show divergent architecture among and backgrounds.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection using a population dynamics approach based on early reported cases, rather than genomic data. They validated the model using simulated data and applied it to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in 2019. The model estimated the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wu at November 28, 2019 with a 95% confidence interval of November 2-December 9, 201. This falls within previously estimated ranges based on genomic data. The approach is generic and can be applied to other outbreaks. The method estimates the number of days between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case as 52 with a 95% interval of 41-78 days. The emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK was estimated at August 21, 202 with a 95% interval of July 23-September 202. The model ignores genomic information, which may explain the difference with a previous estimate of October-December 2019 by Pekar et al. The study highlights the importance of quantifying undetected cases, particularly for emergent pathogens like SARS-2, where early cases may be asymptomatic.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to simulate the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, a process essential for sexual reproduction. The model accounts for attractive forces between homologs and repulsive forces between non-homous chromosomes. It captures the dynamics of entire chromosome ensembles throughout prophase I of meiosis, allowing comparison with experimental data and adjustments for species-specific features such as chromosome number and size, and nuclear dimensions. Simulations show that repulsive forces are most effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing available area per chromosome. Attractive forces come into play when homologs are close. A repulsive force that shortens non-homous interactions is a key feature of the model, representing molecular processes that dissociate nonomous chromosomes. The model allows analysis of individual trajectories for all chromosomes throughout meiotic prophase, facilitating comparison with data. Modifications of chromosomal parameters, including number, size, velocity, and forces provide insights into contributions of each to homolog pairing.
Li-Fumi syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. MicroRNA miR-34 is a p53 target and modifier gene. miR-34-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no cancer development, but lack miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. mi-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebraf and humans. Zraf mi-34 and mi-34/c have similar expression timing in development, but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage by camptecin leads to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants are viable and have normal damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, mi-34- compound with gain-function tp53R217/217 or tp- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp mutants alone, confirming tumor-suppressive of mi-34. Transcriptomics at 28 hours post-fertilization (h) characterized DNA-induced transcription, and 28 and 72h determined mi-34-regulated genes. At 72h, loss mi-34 enhances erythrocyte levels and upregulates my-positive hematopoietic stem. Overexpression mi-34 suppresses reporter, not p53 induction and sensitizes embryos to camptec but not γ-irradiation.

In zraf, mi-34 and mi-34/c are primarily p53-dependent for induction under DNA conditions and partially on p53 for baseline expression. Residual mi-34 induction is due to other transcription factors activated by damage. Direct evidence of mi-34 tumor-suppressive function is provided by earlier onset in mi-34 and tp mutants compared to single tp mutants. Transient overexpression mi-34 induces sensitivity to zraf embryos camptec (C) but not γirradi. C is DNA-inducing topoisomerase inhibitor which activates p in zraf. Despite mi-34 not affecting p53 genes, evaluated mi- effects in tp mutant zraf given epigen silencing M34 in humans TP mutant contributes cancer. Used tp- and tpR217/217 as control and generated homozygous mi-34- tp- and mi- tpR217/217 compound lines. Expression mi-34 is partially on p under conditions and by DNA fully p-dependent.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator OL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of OL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). In hermaphrodites, OL-1 is highly expressed, while in males OL-1 is expressed at low levels. OL-1 is known to be critical for proper male development, but its low expression was considered minimal in hermrodite development. This study reveals OL- plays a role in regulating developmental timing in hermrodogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, hermrod embryos have accelerated cell division and developmentally advanced transcription when OL-1 is lost. Further analysis shows OL- regulates initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and sex-based transcription in hermrodites. OL- mutant embryos overexpress H3K methyltransferase MET-2 with altered H3Kme landscape, effects reversed by MET- loss. This demonstrates OL plays a developmental role in embryos of both sexes and MET acts as OL effector in hermrod.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurv (Mosquito Gene Surveillance) to optimize the placement of mosquito traps for genetic surveillance in the field. This is particularly relevant for gene drive projects, which require monitoring the spread of genetically modified mosquitoes and the emergence of resistant alleles. MGSurv takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and their habitats, such as food sources, breeding sites, and movement patterns, and trap attractiveness. It aims to minimize the time to detect an allele of interest, ideally before remediation is no longer viable. The framework was applied to Anopheles gambia on the island of São Tomé and Principe and Aedes aegypt in Queensland, Australia, demonstrating optimal trap placement. MGS is intended for field and computational researchers interested in mosquito surveillance. The study highlights the importance of early detection, as seen in invasive species studies, to minimize impact and maximize effectiveness of programs.
Researchers studied the microorganism Symbonas scillans, a 1.4μm heterotrophic eukaryote, to investigate the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. They generated amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing data from two strains, RCC257 and RCC24, but found no sequences of known endosymbiotic bacteria. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis also confirmed the absence of endobacteria. Instead, numerous contigs from both strains were related to prasiniruses infecting green algae Ostreoccus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Micromonas pus. Using the Bp genome as reference, they assembled a near-complete 190bp draft genome encoding hallmark prirus genes and two incomplete assemblies of related viruses from RCC257 and RCC. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190nm virus-like particle similar to the endosion originally reported in Sscillans. The study concludes that Sill does not harbor endosymb bacterium but is associated with viruses.
Research on the leiomodin (L) family of actin-binding proteins has revealed a critical role in muscle function, with mutations in three family members (MOD1-3) leading to human myopathies. Mutations in the predominant cardiac isoform, MOD2, result in neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the MOD gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins, yet little to no MOD protein is expressed in nearly all cases. This study shows that nonsense-mediated decay, a cellular mechanism eliminating mRNAs with premature codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two MOD2 disease-causing mutations. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides were generated to obstruct the exon complex, preventing nonsense-mediated decay of MOD2 transcripts, restoring mutant expression. This lays groundwork for therapeutic intervention in MOD-linked myopathies. Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in MOD3, the isoform in skeletal muscle, result in nemal myopathy, a muscle disorder characterized by weakness. Disease mutations have also been found in cardiac-predant iso, MOD2. A mutation in MOD2 (W*) results in severe neonatal dilated cardiomy. In a patient with described MOD disease-causing mutation, MOD protein was not detected via western blot and RT-PCR revealed decrease in MOD mRNA, no change in preRNA. Nonsense-mediated decay was hypothesized to underlie loss of expression. Two additional MOD disease-causing mutations (R* and LV*) were found to lead to lack of MOD expression through NMD. Steric-blocking oligonucleides were developed to inhibit N of MOD transcripts, increasing levels of mutant-truncated protein.
Researchers investigated how different forms of the apolipoprotein E (apo) gene, specifically apoE2, apo3, and apo4, affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Apo4 is known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's, while apo2 is moderately protective. The study used transgenic mice expressing human apo isoforms to measure changes in protein homeostasis, the regulation of protein concentration and quality. In the brain, apo4 and apo2 altered regulation of mitochondrial proteins compared to wild-type apo3. Apo4 disrupted cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autophagy, reducing protein quality. Apo2 increased degradation of mitochondrial and membrane proteins, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, suggesting coordinated replacement of the organelle. The liver did not show these changes, indicating apo-effect on proteasis is amplified in the brain. Combining protein abundance and turnover revealed proteome regulation and its role in biology.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM) toolkit to knock out genes in specific tissues, including motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in Drosophila, a powerful model organism for studying neuromuscular junction (NM) biology. They validated the efficacy of CRTRM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal/UAS expression system and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. Using CRTRM, they discovered an essential role for SNARE components in NM maintenance and found that the ESCRT pathway suppresses NM bouton growth by downregulating retrograde G signaling. Additionally, they found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NM. The CRTRM approach was used to reveal important genes for NM structural plasticity. The NM is a synaptic connection between motor neurons and somatic muscles, a model for studying axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and locomotion. Although CR has been used to tag endogenous proteins at NM, tissue-specific CR has not been applied to the NM. Researchers generated Cas9 lines expressed in motone, glial, and somatic cells by Gal-to-Cas conversion, enhancer fusion, or CR-mediated knock-in to investigate NM morphogenesis with CRTR. They examined the role of secretory pathway by SN proteins. The results suggest SN-mediated pathways are required for NM establishment or maintenance and CRTR can reveal loss of function of essential and redundant genes at NM. Doph motone release extracellular vesicles into synaptic cleft at NM.
During the larval stages of Drosophila development, the lymph gland progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is essential for their differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase) and upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FA) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Research reveals that the Dophila NF-κ transcription factor Rel shields the progenitor pool from metabolic pathway induction into differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, but its input is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. The study sheds light on how NF-κ-like factors integrate with metabolic pathways to regulate cell fate during development. Rel expression is restricted to larval progenitors and overexpression leads to downregulation of FA. NF-κ signaling negatively regulates fatty acid oxidation in various conditions. Developmentally, high ROS levels in progenitor cells elicit JNK to facilitate differentiation. The J-FA axis is essential for progenitor differentiation. Dila NF-κ factor Rel expresses in ROS-rich progenitors and decreases as cells move towards differentiation. Loss of Rel leads to activation of J-FA, coaxing differentiation. Rel inhibition of T1 is lost, and absence results in sustained J activation, impinging FA and differentiation.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene. However, a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNUAT, instead the homozygous RT c.295A variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. In this study, the impact of the variant on RT function was deciphered in RT-depleted R1 cells and patient fibroblasts, and neural stem cells (NS) derived from CRPR/C9-edited induced pluripotent cells revealed major cycle and mitotic abnormalities leading aneuplo, cycle arrest and cell death. Cortical organoids showed an additional function of RT in self-organisation of NS into neural roset, observing delayed ap-basal polarization of NS. These defects contributed to marked roset formation delay in RT-mated organoids, impeding growth and shedding light on mechanisms to microcephaly.

The RT.295A variant, located at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 23, alters splicing site of intron 23. This was confirmed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, and RNA sequencing. The study investigated pathophys mechanisms of the pathogenicity of RT c.295A in a patient with Tay-Like syndrome, in fibrobl derived from patient, and first in human iP-derived models. A patient with clinical features of T but no variants RNUAT was found, wholeome sequencing revealed homozyg pathogenic missense variant NM630 RT c.295A, ArgG, altering splicing. This has been implicated in human disease, microaly, short stature and microgy with seizure (MSS, OM #833).

Patient fibrobl, R1 cells, and CR9-ed pluripotent cells were differentiated into NS and corticaloids. Analysis of RT isoforms resulting from mutated allele and cellular studies centome complex and functions were conducted. Results established RT c295A consequences. RT-mated NS accumulated G-M due mitotic abnormalities leading ane, arrest or apoptosis. These defects associated misorientation mit spindles favouring premature NS into neurons.
Researchers conducted a six-year experiment to study the dynamics of Escherichia coli's adaptation to prolonged resource exhaustion, a state known as long-term stationary phase (LT). They used whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points to reveal novel aspects of adaptation. E. coli continuously adapts through convergent accumulation of mutations up to six years, establishing long-lasting lineages with similar across populations. Lineages defined by same mutations behave similarly. Convergent mutation was also observed in LTE, with populations accumulating similar mutations to loci. The study identified pairs of loci with significant mutation associations, suggesting historical contingency. Associations were frequent, with a third of mutated loci involved in at least one. Results demonstrate LT adaptation characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency.
Researchers have re-examined the role of the male-specific (MSA) transcript in Drosophila melanogaster, which was initially classified as a non-coding RNA, and found it codes for a microptide that regulates sperm usage in mated females. The MSA transcript shares a promoter with another transcript, iab-8nc, which is produced in both sexes in the central nervous system. However, while MSA produces a peptide, i-8 does not. The study reveals that the absence of i-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism involving unique 5' exons of i-ncRNA, which contain upstream reading frames that prevent protein production from downstream frames. Using cell culture and transgenic analysis, researchers show that this mechanism relies on the presence of open reading frames in these exons. The i-nc transcript is expressed in the central nervous system and its loss leads to male and female sterility due to loss of microRNA within its introns. A shorter version of this transcript, male-specific (MSA), is found in male abdomen and codes for microptide MSi that mediates sperm usage in females. The difference between MS and i- transcripts lies in their first exons.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of ultra-rare multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays. Loss-of-function mutations in glycosylation genes lead to CD. Due to the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms can affect most systems. CD are likely connected because they affect glycosylation and show similar symptoms in patients, suggesting common modifiers may affect multiple CD. This study leveraged evolutionary tools to analyze glycos genes and identify modifiers for all CD genes. Evolutionary covariation (ERC) between N-linked glycosylation and GPI synthesis suggests unexplored connections between pathways. ERC occurs when proteins are under evolutionary constraints. High ERC was found between GP1, a GPI transamase, and AL1, manosyltransfer in N-linked glycos (ERC=0.29). Seven glycos proteins in top-scoring pairs are associated with CD, suggesting known CD genes are candidates for modifiers. Top scores revealed ERC between PB and U20 (ERC=0.33) and P and W36 (ERC=0.74). Glycos is conserved from yeast to mammals, allowing strong signals to develop over time. Identified modifiers for CD have ERC, including PM2-PG1 (7.08) and D1-D1 (4.17). In vivo testing top hits had a higher rate (10/16) than previous studies (5/16 and /34).
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein, HBc, contains two domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and arginine-rich C-terminal (CTD) for pregenomic (pg) RNA encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBCTD, especially at Ser162 and 170, is essential for nucleation with polymerase (Pol) to initiate pg encapsation. As caps mature, HBCT undergoes deosphorylation, suggesting involvement of a phosphatase in late encapsation stage. Using a-S170 antibody for nonosphorylated HB-S170, a transition from phosphorylated to deosphory state during pg packaging was observed. Pol-dependent deory of HB-S170 was confirmed by substitution of single amino acid Val782 in RNase domain, abolishing deory of HB-S170. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry, and protein analyses showed recruitment of host phosphat PP dependent on Pol-Val domain. This does not require HB but Pol via RNA signal, suggesting Pol-pRNA plays role in PP recruitment. Pol-pRNA-PP-mediated deory HB-S is essential for pg encapsation completion and associated with endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVs). HB may play dual role by bringing pg to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion into caps.
Researchers investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. They sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from genera Codia and Cten, collected on either side of the isthmus, to study how environmental conditions influenced the selection of symbts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucid sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazotropha symbts, with those from the Caribbean having genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Eastern Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of nifDK operon revealed the common ancestor lacked n genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats required the operon through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola symbt lineage. The study suggests HGT of n operon facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazro enducida clade, highlighting importance of nitrogen in ecological diversification of chemynthetic symbt species and bacterial role in adaptation to changing conditions.
Researchers have identified 9,291 taste receptors (TASRs) from 661 vertebrate genomes, revealing that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high number of TR genes. Phylogenetic analysis shows that most species have TR genes in clusters, but amphibians have more clusters and genes per cluster. One-to-one orthologs are found between closely related species, but total TR count is stable in lineages. TR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues. In vitro assays, many amphibian TRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xeniotics. Bitter taste is associated with a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) called TRs or T2, encoded by compact intronless genes. Vertebrates have a wide TR repertoire, varying across lineages from zero in cetans to two in frogs. Levels of turnover suggest multiple mechanisms driving evolution of bitter receptor repertoire. Phylogen relationships and genomic location suggest recombination plays a role in variation. Number of expressed receptors not in tongue is proportional to number of TRs in genome, suggesting increases allowed acquisition of tissue-specific functions.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in regulating transcription and its impact on intestinal stem cells. A protein complex containing NICD, RBP, and MAML binds to DNA as monomers or dimers to regulate Notch expression. Notch dimer-deficient (NDD) alleles of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitive to environmental insults but develop normally otherwise. Transcriptomic analysis of colon spheroids showed no dimer-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro, and an elevated epithelial immune response to symbionts, likely causing heightened sensitivity in DD mice. TurboID and nano-spray MS/MS analyses in human carcinoma cells expressing NOT2 or NOT2 revealed an unbalanced interactome with reduced NOT2 interaction with transcription machinery but preserved interaction with HD2, suggesting modulation via cooperativity. HD2 inhibitor Valpro acid (PA) prevented intestinal consequences of DD and gamma-secretase inhibitors in mice spheroids, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation program in stem cells. Notch dimerization in mammals is less about transcriptional regulation and more about proteome environment with consequences to immunity and hypersensitivity of DD mice. HD3 interacts with NIC, regulating stability and activity.
Researchers have extended the theory of background selection to understand how it affects genetic diversity and differentiation in populations with migration. Background selection occurs when deleterious alleles reduce diversity at linked sites, influencing total diversity (π) and genetic differentiation (F) in populations. The theory is split into two regimes: the background regime with strong selection and low mutation rates, and the interference regime with weak selection and high mutation rates. Previous work focused on deleterious alleles in the background regime, but migration's effects on F were not fully explained. This study derives new theory for migration's impact on background selection in a subpopulation and extends the interference regime to an island model. Simulations show the theory predicts F and π accurately. Background selection can increase F under high migration by reducing correlated fitness effects within subpopulations, but decrease π in metapopulations with large effective size. The work extends background theory to structured populations and suggests it minimally confounds locus-to-locus F scans. A quantitative model accounts for migration's effects in an island, showing it lessens cross-gener associations between neutral and deleter alleles. Non-trivial migration rates attenuate background's effects on F, reducing π and π. Theoretical predictions support background weakly confounding locus-loc F scans with common flow. Simulations suggest this in an island when m ≥ t. The study derives F in an island with background and finite demes, migration following genetic drift. The approach accounts for migration's influence on background in an island with diploid individuals.
Researchers have emphasized the importance of increasing genetic and phenotypic data size for understanding disease determinants, but face methodological barriers in collaboration and data sharing among institutions hinder high-powered studies. Statistical approaches, such as generalized linear mixed models, are necessary to correct for confounders that may bias results. However, privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI) and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), limit data sharing and hinder collaborative efforts. Federated approaches alleviate these issues by keeping data local. To address this, a federated genetic testing tool, FedGAT, was developed, utilizing federated statistical approach for association tests correcting confounding and polygenic effects without sharing data. Using simulated and real datasets, FedAT achieves similar results to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements.

Challenges in federated studies include designing and collecting harmonized data with covariates and phenotypes ahead of time. Sites may perform meta-analyses by sharing summary statistics, reducing burden and privacy concerns. Previous research focused on secure GWAS using federated methods, mainly χ2 tests, Principal Component Analysis, and logistic regression. However, there is a lack of correcting confounding poly effects in association due to complexity.

A federated association algorithm, FedAT, was proposed, integrating subject-level effects and study designs without changes. Its flexibility stems from efficient testing GAT formulation. A privacy-preserving feder GW algorithm, FedAT, uses generalized mixed model and two-step testing, integrating homomorphic encryption and One-Time Pad encryption to protect statistics in feder setting.
Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-based incidence and mortality, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, their accuracy continues to improve, and research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness in African and Asian populations is key for equitable use. Recent algorithm developments for PRS derivation have resulted in pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. This study benchmarks the predictive power of six widely used PRS algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts, finding modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a simple method prioritizing variants, clumping, and polygenic scores. The study underscores the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. 

Advances in genetics have led to methods for cross-ance PR disease prediction, but these have not been formally assessed for prostate. A comprehensive analysis across biob-scale datasets benchmarked six algorithms, finding improvement over traditional clumping methods. These are based on variant prioritization, shrinkage, joint statistics, annotation, mapping, and population heritability. This is the first to assess panance polygenic prostate in the All Us cohort. Hierarchical clustering stratified poly scores by ancestry. PR-strat PSA screening may reduce overdiagnosis and over-treatment with PSA alone, but ancestry-associated incidence and outcome biases require equal performance across populations to limit disparities. The study evaluated published scores in the UKob cohort, finding no differences in cancer or risk factors such as year, BMI, smoking, or alcohol. Public scores were tested in the dataset, trained on allelic scoring and first 10 components, regardless of population. Predictive models improved with age and poly, similar to UKob, family and BMI did not increase power. The utility of UKob dataset shows genetic with age sufficient to predict cancer.
Researchers identified a congenital disorder of glycosylation, DPAG1CD, caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-glycosylation. They used a Drosophila model of DP1CD with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype and performed a drug repurposing screen on 1,520 FDA-approved small molecules. The screen identified 42 candidates that improved the DP1 model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DP1 model. Loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting dopamine flux and binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to glycosylation as a potential therapeutic target for DP1CD. The study also validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine, CO, and NK1 inhibitors, revealing novel biology and potential therapeutics for DP1CD.
Researchers developed a computational model, called topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topoVA), to understand how the brain represents limb position and movement in the somatosensory cortex. The model was trained on natural human movement data and reproduced two key observations from monkey studies: the shape and velocity of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and the distribution of preferred directions (PD) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model predicts that encoding across the cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs and few neurons encode a single joint. This provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and theoretical basis for neural manifolds, with applications in brain-computer interfaces and humanoid control. The model translates proprio inputs from body movements into a latent representation, read as neural firing, and has minimal bias towards a particular sensory modality, generalizing to other regions of cortex. Proprioceptive areas are crucial for goal-directed behavior, but principles of cortical coding are unclear. The model relates kinematics to proprio encoding and compares to single-unit recordings from monkeys, predicting neural coding and spatial organization across cortex.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene, a plant hormone involved in growth and stress responses, in plant-micro interactions from the plant perspective. However, few studies have examined its role in microbes. This study found that Azospirillum brasil, a plant-associated bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospillum Eth Response 1 (AE1), which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and root colonization. RNA sequencing and metabolomics showed ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters A. brasil colonization density and metabolism, indicating the bacterium adapts to ethylene sensing. This provides potential targets for regulating beneficial plant-micro interactions. Ethylene receptors have been well-stud in plants but not extensively in non-plant species. This study shows AE1 directly binds eth and regulates A brasil physiology, reducing biofilm and root colonization. The role of ethylene as a signal in this species and its perception by the bacter on traits including colonization was examined, demonstrating AE1 affects carbon and nitrogen metabolism. A model suggests ethylene from plants affects A brasil colonization pattern and density.
Researchers investigated the role of the IN80 protein, a catalytic subunit of the IN80 chromatin remodeling complex, in regulating gene silencing on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. Immunolocalization of IN80 at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggested its involvement in the meiotic body. Deletion of IN80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes and active RNA polymerase II on sex chromosomes, indicating incomplete inactivation of sex genes. Reduced recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex inhibition (MSCI) suggested IN80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors for silencing sex genes. This role was independent of common IN80 target H2A. Instead, IN80 absence reduced chromatin accessibility at DNA sites on sex chromosomes. Data suggest IN80 role in DNA factor localization, facilitating silencing sex genes during pachema.

 IN80 interacts and regulates sex gene silencing in pene spermatocytes, promoting chromatin opening during zyema-pachema transition at DSB regions. IN80 regulates chromosome accessibility during meiotic progression. Accessibility is central to DNA repair and transcription. IN80 also regulates somatic silencing autosomes in spermat by H3me3 modification, while H4 remains unaffected. IN80 silencing sex genes meiotic is independent of direct transcriptional regulation by DNA factor recruitment.

This study demonstrates IN80 unique role in silencing sex genes pach spermat. IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB sex regions, independent H2. IN80 interacts DSBR factors ATR and MDC, facilitating M1 recruitment sex pach. IN80 also interacts DNA factors A and M1 meiotic spermat γ2X at D sites zema remained IN80KO [18]. Initial γ2 X synapse IN80-filitated M1 amplifies in ATR-dependent.
Researchers investigated the role of SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasmin family, in axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. SV-1 has a dual function, acting as an HGF growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease to regulate development. The study aimed to understand how SV-1 is converted from a protease to growth factor for axon regeneration. Cytidine deaminase CDD-2 was found to play a role in the conversion of SV-1. A codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of SV-1 suppressed the c-2 defect in axon regeneration. The hairpin structure around His-755 in sv-1 mRNA was required for activation of ax regeneration by SV-1. Results suggest C-2 promotes ax regeneration by transforming SV-1 function from protease to growth through modification of sv-1 mRNA.
Researchers used zebraf fish to investigate the possibility of controlling collective behavior by modifying the characteristics of individual constituents, rather than the environment. They genetically modified zebraf to study the effect of a lack of col11a gene, which causes early onset osteoarthritis, resulting in compromised vertebral properties, bent bodies, and slower swimming. Surprisingly, a group of mutant fish exhibited more orderly motion than wildtype. A simple active matter model captured collective behavior of wild and mutant zraf, with mutant modeled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates tuning a biological system by changing state with simple matter. 

The study used zraf, with well-established collective behavior, monitored by individual tracking and genetic modification. Collective behavior can be compared to active matter models, encapsulating fish properties, interactions, and environment interactions. The behavior of zraf with homozygous deleterious mutation in cola gene (col2-) was investigated, with both parents exhibiting same mutation. Modeling swimming zraf as active matter revealed physiologically relevant behaviors underpinned by skeleton changes, demonstrating utility as tool to relate genetic traits to physiological changes. 

The study quantified behavioral difference between wildtype and cola- zraf, whose cola gene is knocked out. Modification caused vertebral defects, body bending, and slower reorientation. Compromised development and bending prevented mutants from frequent directional swimming, longer orientational time. Cola- zraf exhibited less orientational noise, modeled as self-prop agents aligning. Group reduced noise captured by increased persistence.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the formation of capillary networks in vitro, a crucial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical cues to predict cell migration, morphology, deformation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transport. The results show that capillary networks develop when mechanical and chemical signals work together, with morphology driven by soluble and bound forms of VEG. Soluble VEG induces morphological changes, while bound VEG on the biog surface provides orientational signals. The network relies on biog deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and bound VEG gradient for spatial cues. The model agrees with experiments, but has limitations, such as omitting bound VEG necessity and not fully reproducing biog results. A hybrid model by vaners et al. shows capillary development via stress and strain between cells and substrates. Another model by Vilanova et al uses cell-based CPM and PDE to predict endothelial migration and biog deformation.
In the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans, the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) family consists of five secreted peptide factors that play significant roles in cell, tissue patterning, and organism homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. Typically studied as homodimers, these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that enhance, repress or generate novel functions. This study demonstrates that all five TGF ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens, and multiple TGF ligand pairs act redundantly as part of this response. The BMP-like ligand DB-1 and TIG-2 function independently in the immune response, while T-2/BMP and TGF/Activin-like T-3 function together. Structural modeling supports potential for T-2 and T-3 to form heterodimers. T-2 and T-3 are members of a subset TGF ligands lacking conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking dimers. Canonical DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transducers function in response to pathogens, while components of D- TGF/Activ signaling do not play a major role in survival.
This study investigates the role of the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat4) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat4 acetylates the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2, and is implicated in the response to DNA damage. Yeast cells lacking Nat4 exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more breaks than wild-type cells. Upon damage, Nat4 expression is elevated and the enzyme is recruited to double-strand breaks. Deeper into its effects on the damage cascade, Nat4-deleted cells have lower levels of damage-induced H2ASph (H2) and diminished binding of checkpoint protein Rad9 surrounding double-strand. Consistently, Mec1 recruitment to double-str breaks, critical for H2ph deposition and Rad retention, is impaired in Nat4 cells. Consequently, Mec-dependent phosphorylation of effector Rad53, indicative of damage activation, is reduced. Importantly, Nat's effects in the cascade are mediated by its-terminal acetylase activity towards histone4. This study points to a novel link between histone acetylase Nat and DDR, associating new modifying activity in genome integrity.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells within a tumor, known as a phylogeny, using DNA mutations from multiple samples. Current methods can only accurately reconstruct phylogenies with up to 30 mutations, but Orchard can handle up to 1000 mutations. It uses a novel approach called factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogen, where each factor corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a built phyeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating incrementally larger phylogenies until a complete tree with all mutations. Evaluations show Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing plausible phylogen across 90 cancers and 14 B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias. It accurately reconstructs phylogen with up to 1,000 mutations. Large phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations.
Researchers have developed Immugen, a modular language model for predicting immunogenicity of CD8+ epitopes, a crucial for personalized cancer treatment development. Immunogenicity prediction is challenging due to low reactivity rates in neoantigens and limited training datasets. Immugen consists of a pMHC module trained on three pHC tasks, an optional TCR module, and context-specific immunogenic prediction modules. Compared to state-of-the-art models, Immugen performs comparably on pHC affinity, eluted ligand, and stability tasks, and outperforms on pHC immunogenic prediction (AUC=0.619, precision=0.514) with 7% increase in precision. Immugen's performance improves with TCR integration. The model is analyzed for interpretability, highlighting areas of weakness in existing models and biases in datasets. CD8 neoepitopes play a key role in personalized therapeutics, allowing targeted treatments. Immugen is a modular language model achieving state-the performance on pHC immunogenic prediction and integrating TCR inputs. The pHC module processes peptideHLA input, with immunogenic classification fine-tuned with T-based inputs. Immugen provides a framework for immunogenic prediction using a protein model achieving state-the performance on CD+ reactivity data.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study and gene-based analysis on 230 fast-growing feathered chickens to identify genes related to meat lightness and redness, a primary indicators of meat quality. They mapped a 6.24 QTL region (G15: 629.34-630.58 kb) and found that protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1) was associated with meat color (p=8.65E-08). Mendelian randomization analysis validated the causal relationship between PPP1 expression and lightness (p<2.9E-12). Skeletal muscle-specific PPP1 knockout mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in muscles, with a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcript and metabolome analysis revealed decreased slow-twitch myofiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. A plasm reporter assay showed a SNP (rs520, C>T) in PPP1 regulated transcription. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, and rs520 variant expression were detected between fast-growing and local chickens. The study identified PPP1 as the causative gene for color and a novel variant for meat improvement.
Researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the functional architecture of the retina by identifying subunits within ganglion cells' receptive fields. This method combines principles from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently locate subunits, allowing for further investigation of retinal circuitry. Simulations demonstrate STR's reliability in identifying subunits across various models, and experiments on primate ganglion cells validate its feasibility. STR can reveal subunit layouts in a few minutes, making it suitable for real-time analysis of receptive field structure in recordings. 

The technique, STR, combines stimulated emission depletion microscopy and computed tomography, uses the center-surround structure of Ricker stripes to sharpen subunit responses and tomographically reconstruct subunits. A simplified ganglion model was extended to test STR in a realistic setting. Electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells were used to investigate STR's potential. Rapid subunit identification leaves time for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry, enabling targeted stimuli to characterize spatiotemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic weights of subunits. By knowing sub locations, interactions between bipolar cells can be evaluated.
Researchers have developed a novel statistical method called CRISPR-DR to identify genes that interact with antibiotics in chemical-genetic interaction (CGI) experiments. The method uses CRISPR interference (CRi) technology to measure the abundance of mutants in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, reflecting synergistic behavior. CRPRDR incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a dose-response equation to capture the non-linear interaction between them, where the effect of drug concentration is maximized for intermediate sgRNAs and less for those that induce too much or little target depletion. The method requires multiple sgRNAs for each target, varying in strength, and actual efficiencies experimentally quantified in control conditions as input. The primary use case is identification of chemical-genetic interactions with drug as a covariate. In CGI experiments, variable sgRNA efficiency can identify genes whose depletion synergizes with increasing drug concentration. The CRPRDR model extends the Hill equation to incorporate an extra term representing relative efficiency of each sgRNA targeting gene. It captures the non-linear interaction between sgRNA and drug, where the effect of drug on mutants' abundance can be larger for intermediate sgRN and flatter for high or low efficiency sgRN. The method was applied to a Mycobacterium tuberculosis dataset and E. coli growth on different carbon sources, showing competitive performance with related methods but higher precision.
Researchers investigated the structure of gene-expression networks in Drosophila melanogaster using RNA-seq data from an outbred population. They employed a community detection method, the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM), which does not assume genes are organized into assortative modules. Instead, SBM separates genes into hierarchically organized blocks using all information in the co-expression network. Results showed that SBM found ten times more groups than competing methods, and several groups were not modular. Functional enrichment of non-modular groups was as strong as modular communities. This suggests the transcriptome is structured more complex than thought, and modularity is not the main driver of gene-expression structuring. The study did not explore network estimation before community detection, using weighted networks for WGC and sparser for SBM. Non-modular blocks were widespread, with strong functional relevance, highlighting the need to incorporate beyond assortativity in biological networks. Methods like graphical LASSO have been used, providing better estimates of gene-gene connections and weights. Combining SB with network inference is possible, using community structure to inform inference. To address alternative organizations, a similarity measure was used to find non-assortative groups with biological interpretation, implemented in SBM. Networks were trimmed to remove spurious edges, maintaining structure. Assumming communities are assortative, WGC was compared to SB, showing SB outperformed.
Researchers investigated the role of cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) in yeast, which is involved in post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. To understand its direct and indirect roles, they used mass spectrometry to assess the yeast proteome, RNA-Seq to analyze transcript abundance, and RiboSeq to analyze translation in cells lacking PP1. Results showed drastic changes in proteome and transcriptome, and defects in translation initiation and termination in PP1 cells. Defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in PP cells appear partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components, in addition to PP's direct role. Cells devoid of PP manifested nonsense readthrough indicative of termination defect. The study indicates loss of PP is pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous post-transcription regulation aspects.
Researchers investigated the generation of slow brain rhythms, such as those occurring during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures, and spreading depolarization, which are accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. These rhythms typically have a lower frequency than action potential firing and are thought to arise from network mechanisms involving synaptic interactions, delays, or intrinsic bursting neurons. The study proposes an alternative mechanism applicable to all neurons with class I excitability, based on the interplay between fast spiking dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Bifurcation analysis of the system reveals a hysteres loop around a bistable region emerging from a saddle bifurcation common in class I excitable neurons. Depending on Na+/K+-Pase strength, bursts are generated from pump-induced bifurcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. The study suggests transitions between dynamics result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypox affecting Na+/Pase activity. A minimal model outlining the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics may contribute to understanding pathologies like epilepsy and inform therapeutic strategies.
Researchers developed the COPS package to evaluate and compare multi-omics clustering methods for disease subtyping, focusing on stability and prognostic relevance. Current frameworks lack comparison between data-driven and pathway clustering, highlighting a methodological gap. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration, some of which are not accessible in R and new approaches proposed. The framework was applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and methylation data. Unlike previous studies, COPS contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival via Cox models including covariates, and stability. Survival and standard metrics vary across methods and datasets, necessitating multi-criteria evaluation. The Pareto concept was applied to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case study. Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic development and specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. A novel loss-of-function sem-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain was identified, revealing new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM-2 antagonizes LET-381, the C. elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage, and is essential for the proliferation and diversification of SM. SEM-2 also regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for patterning the lineage. This study adds to the understanding of the conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins and the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembry development. Previous studies have identified transcription and signaling components essential for the M lineage, including LIN-12/Notch signaling and zinc finger factor SMA-9. SEM-2 encodes the sole SoxC protein in C. elegans, while vertebrates have three SoxC, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox. SoxC have a conserved DNA domain, serine region, and transactivation domain. Amino acid 158 is conserved in So homologs. SMA- and LET-381 repress sem- in the dorsal M to prevent SM fate. HL-8 functions in M development: cleavage, proliferation, and differentiation. This study provides insight into relationships between factors in M development and So transcription factor SEM-2.
