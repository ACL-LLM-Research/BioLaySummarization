Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of reported cases of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) cases in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the past two decades. However, pockets of infection remain, and it is crucial to assess which areas are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. A previously developed mathematical model for Gambian trypanosomias in the DRC was used to capture the dynamics of the disease at a health area level of approximately 10,000 people. This is the first time a stochastic model has been directly fitted to data, allowing for better quantification of uncertainty in results. A particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology was used to fit the model to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kivu province as a case study. Spatial heterogeneity in cases was reflected in the results, predicting that under current strategies, the area Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, will have the latest year for elimination. Deterministic and stochastic models were compared, with the latter producing virtually indistinguishable posteriorisation but faster computation times. It is suggested that deterministic fits should be used for health area expansion in the DRC for efficiency, with stochastic for parameter and variation and elimination estimations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze the tumor microenvironment (ME) of cancer patients to better understand how it affects patient outcomes and treatment success with immunotherapies. The ME contains information on cancer through cellular and spatial distribution of tumor and immune cell populations. The approach uses spatial functions to summarize relationships in ME and applies data analysis to predict outcomes and identify important interactions. This method was tested on simulated data and real data from triple-negative breast and lung cancer patients. The method is resistant to overfitting and false discovery rate. 

The approach begins by creating functions for cell-cell or marker interactions in images, reduces dimensions using principal components, and combines with patient data to predict outcomes. Spatial functions have been used in ME analysis. An example shows immune cell distribution around tumor in a triple breast cancer patient. The method aims to compare ME and clinical data between groups and identify differences in cell phenotypes, proteins, and predict a new patient's group using ME data. Various technologies are available for this purpose, each with benefits and trade-offs. Comparing ME, spatial relationships between cell types, such as tumor and immune populations, are predictive of outcomes and guide interventions. 

The method was applied to TNBC and lung data from multiplex ion imaging. TNBC was separated into "compartmentised" and "mixed" groups based on tumor-immune interactions. The approach was effective in identifying interactions and controlling false rate. The method is publicly available in R package funkells.
Researchers investigated how abnormal neural synchronization in the brain, observed in various disorders, affects brain function. They computationally studied neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure changes, particularly during desynchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbations. To investigate the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, they combined a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic and structural plasticity: (i) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), (ii) homeostatic structural plasticity (SP), without weight-dependent pruning and ST, (iii) combination of ST and SP, without weight pruning, and (iv) combination of ST and SP, including SP and weight pruning. To accommodate diverse neuronal firing timescales, they introduced a simple stochastic model, enabling numerical analysis. Network theory revealed that structural reorganization remarkably enhances network synchrony. Weaker connections were preferentially eliminated by weight-pruning, synchrony was achieved with sparser connections in STDP model. Strengthening contacts from high-firing neurons to low-firing and weakening in opposite, followed by removal, allowed strong synchrony with fewer connections. This reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. They compared desynchronization of synchronized states in STDP model with desynchronization models iii and iv. Latter required higher intensity for long-term desynchronization. Findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive modalities inducing lasting relief, e.g., Parkinson's disease.
Researchers have studied the regeneration of the nervous system in planarians, a type of flatworm, and found that neurons and glia (supportive cells) are regenerated from distinct progenitors. They discovered that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing the Delta-2 gene, a key in the central and peripheral nervous systems, while glia are specified from Notch-1-expressing mesodermal phagocytic progenitors. Inhibiting Delta-2 or Notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect other phagocytic cell types. Loss of Delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation associated with them, while transplanting Delta-2-express photoreceptors formed glia at ectopic locations. This suggests a model where Delta-2-express neurons instruct phagoc progenitors to differentiate into glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of neuron and glia numbers and types. 

A model is proposed where Delta-2-express neurons interact with Notch-express phoc progenitors to regenerate planarian neurons and glia. This hypothesis presents a solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia, where Delta-2 on neurons and Notch on phoc progenitors specify gl fate and differentiation. This mechanism is modular, allowing evolution of new gl configurations in the nervous system by neurons acquiring or losing Delta-2 and accessing phoc progenitors.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 in individuals with varying levels of neutralization breadth. Participants were categorized as "broad" and "non-road" neutralizers based on their ability to neutralize HIV-1. γδ T cells were analyzed from pre-acquisition and during acute infection (AHI) in 217 individuals. Results showed significant differences in γ T cell surface marker expression between neutralizers and non-neutralizers. Activation of γ T cells within the first weeks of HIV acquisition was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on δ1 T and CD57 on δ2 T cells was higher in broad neutralizers during AHI and associated with development of neutral breadth later. Levels of CD16 on δ T were also associated with early Env-specific IgM production. In contrast, δ T expansion occurred during chronic infection (CH) and was not associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on δ and CD57 on δ during A was higher in broadizers and associated with development of neutral later. Levels of CD16 on δ were associated with early Env-specific IgM production. The study found δ T cells were reduced early during A and loss associated with viral load. Understanding how δ cells promote neutralization could inform vaccine strategies targeting these cells to improve humoral responses, especially broad and neutralizing to HIV-1 Env. The study evaluated frequency and phenotype of δ cells from pre-HIV and during A in participants with and without neutralization, allowing evaluation of δ contribution to viral control and promotion of humoral responses. Frequency δ T was lower at 18 post-HIV positive in neutralizers, reflecting higher VL. CD levels on δ and δ as well as CD on δ were higher in neutralizers.
Researchers have discovered that tumor-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner. Blocking the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors with a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, significantly reduced metastatic burden in preclinical mouse cancer models. Bispecific antibodies, which combine two antigen-binding sites into one molecule, are a promising modality for drug development due to enhanced avidity and dual targeting. However, elucidating the mechanisms of binding and inhibition is crucial for maximizing efficacy. A computational model of BS1 was developed to study multivalent binding, providing insights into affinity and avidity effects, guiding therapeutic design. Simulations of monovalent and bivalent interactions between antibody constructs and IL-6, IL-8 receptors established how properties and conditions impact binary and ternary complex formation. Results demonstrated balance drives receptor inhibition, providing predictions for effective design. A bispecific antibody BS targeting IL-6R and IL-8 was modeled, comprised of ODEs for receptors, antibodies, and complexes. To target IL-6, IL-8 signaling for metastasis inhibition, a novel bis antibody BS was engineered against IL-6 and IL8. BS contains variable domains of anti-IL-6 and anti-8 antibodies. Data suggest targeting IL-6, IL-8, and receptors inhibits metastasis and cancer lethality. Monoclon antibodies have been in anti-cancer regimens due specificity, stability, construction, and multifaceted actions. Simulations of BS binding over antibody concentrations and cell IL-6, IL-8 expression levels revealed receptor expression and ratio critical bispecific binding. When IL-6 and IL-8 are in 1:1 ratio, bis binding is similar to anti-IL-6 and anti-8 monospecific.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doubleort-family kinase, in the assembly and stability of centrosomal spindles in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. ZYG-8 is a mammalian homolog that is upregulated in many cancers and implicated in cell division, but its mechanisms of function are poorly understood. Depletion of ZYG- from oocytes resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects. Experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that Z-8 depletion led to excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role in regulating the force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Additionally, Z-8 is required for microtule dynamics within the oocyte and kinase activity is required for function during meiosis and mitosis. The study proposes that Z- plays two roles: 1) regulating microt dynamics to facilitate proper turnover of microtules within the spindle, and 2) influencing activity of motors along microtules to tune forces and stabilize the spindle. Z- contains a microtule-binding doubleort domain and kinase domain. Previous studies demonstrated Z- is required for proper spindle positioning in mitotically dividing embryos and modulates microule dynamics in mitosis. This study shows Z- is required for assembly and stability of oocyte spindle, and kinase activity is required for functions in mitosis and meiosis, and reveals roles in modulating microule and motor forces within oocyte.
This study investigated the relationship between circulating metabolites, genetics, and type 2 diabetes (T2) risk in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids (HDL, ID, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. Integrating data with large T2 GWAS from DIANTE meta-analysis through Mendelianization, 79 metabolites were found to have a causal association with T2, spanning lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2 liability, spanning all classes including branched amino acids. Using interaction trait locus (QTL) analysis, four metabolites were consistently replicated in an independent Estonian Biob dataset, with genetic loci in different regions showing attenuated regulation in T2 cases compared to controls. Variants from the Q analysis were significant for corresponding metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, suggesting T consequences on genetic regulation. Through differential analysis, 165 metabolites were associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of 165, 40 were not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting biological mechanisms specific to complications. This work provides a map of T consequences on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling understanding of T trajectory to complications.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to tolerance to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection in mice. They crossed two strains, CC061 and CC, which are susceptible and tolerant to MRSA, respectively, to generate F1 and F2 populations. The F1 and F2 mice showed 65% and 55 survival rates after MRSA infection, indicating a complex inheritance pattern of the tolerant phenotype. Colonization in F2 mice was more extreme than their parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 was identified for survival and weight change after infection, with the WSB/EJ allele in CC mice contributing to tolerance. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, with high-impact variants in this region, are receptors for complement C5a, anaphylatoxin, which can trigger a massive immune response. The researchers hypothesize C5 may have altered binding to receptors in CC mice, reducing cytokine damage and allowing tolerance to higher pathogen burden and longer survival.
Researchers investigated how genetic networks influence adaptation during evolutionary walks towards a phenotypic optimum. They modeled a trait as a product of a gene regulatory network, specifically an autoregulatory motif, and used forward genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks in both additive and network models. Contrary to the expectation from adaptive theory, both models harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles. The network model had a complex bimodal distribution of fitness among mutations, with a considerable density of deleterious coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. The study suggests that interactions from networks can generate complex distributions of fitness effects. 

The researchers combined biological modeling with tools to evaluate the distribution of fitness effects among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks, finding differences from classical expectations in some cases. Both models exhibited similarities in adaptive walks, specifically the number of steps and distribution of fitness among fixations and beneficial mutations. However, the network model had fewer large-effect mutations than expected, more so than additive as the walk progressed. This was highlighted by a difference in responses to selection: the rate of trait evolution. Network simulations approached the optimum more slowly than additive on average. 

The study explored a simple network's influence on evolution during an adaptive scenario. Traditional models rely on genotype-phenotype relationships, overlooking gene networks that drive trait expression. The distribution of fitness changed when non-additive maps were considered, affecting a population's chance to adapt. A simple regulatory motif motivated the approach and nonlinear map into adaptive theory. A trait foundation lies a network of genes and elements controlling protein expression.
Researchers have proposed a novel Bayesian framework for understanding how neurons integrate information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. They suggest that conductance-based neurons and synapses are naturally equipped to optimally perform this integration. In this framework, apical dendrites represent prior expectations of somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. The authors demonstrate that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment computes the corresponding posterior. A gradient-based plasticity rule is derived, allowing neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. This theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration and makes experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and plasticity.

The authors interpret the physics of cortical neurons as Bayesian computations, showing that conduct-based models naturally compute posterior distributions from likelihood and prior in dendritic compartments. Somatic membrane dynamics is derived from gradient ascent on posterior, and synaptic plasticity matches posterior to a target distribution. Before plasticity, they discuss a consequence for dynamics from the Bayesian view, predicting neuronal properties differing from classical models. In conductance, somatic potentials reflect prior in absence of input, allowing dendrite to adjust reliability. The framework derives membrane dynamics and plasticity jointly via ascent on log-posterior of somatic potentials. Simulations demonstrate learning a multisensory task.
Researchers have used the Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) from experimental structures as a basis to classify and catalog domains from 48 whole proteomes in the AlphaFold Database. They achieved an average classification rate of 90% for domains or identifiable non-domain regions in all proteomes, classifying 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins of 226,424 amino acid residues. The study examined populations of homologous groups in eukaryotes and bacteria, finding eukotes have a higher proportion of disordered regions and unassigned domains, as well as repeated globular and small proteins. Shared domains between eukotes and bacteria include Rossm, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. The study compared sampling of homolog groups from whole proteome against EC reference and stable groups enriched by predictions, discussing implications for future classification strategies for large protein sets. 

In eukotes and bacteria, sequence and structural classifications converged for well-understood families, while less populated homolog groups showed structural classification of previously unannotated sequence domains. Domains from proteomes suggested biological insights for respective organisms, available on EC website. After AlphaFold release, domain relative to unstructured or low-confidence regions prompted examining classification on broad proteomes. Classifying domains into easily recognizable, difficult-to-recognize, or unstructured/no domains remains useful for large datasets. The study classified 48 proteomes in AF, including zebraf, flies, and E. coli, with lower eukote classification rate due to prediction and contextual errors. DP returned 98% residues (Fig 1). Access to previously unclassifiable proteins diminished gap between structural and sequence classification. Homolog groups enriched by domains and sequence annotations estimated structure expanded knowledge of unknown domains.
Researchers investigated the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no current antiviral treatment, to understand how it replicates within host cells. Using single-cell analysis, they found that BKV's large T antigen (TAg) expression is required for viral replication, contradicting the current model that TAg is expressed early to push cells into the S phase for replication. Instead, BKV relies on the host's S phase to replicate, similar to other small DNA viruses like papilloma and adenoviruses. Robust TAg expression was observed in cells with ≥4N DNA content, indicating BKV production depends on initial S phase. Chemical inhibitors preventing host DNA replication showed that viral replication also relies on initial S phase. BKV is unusual as it re-replicates host DNA and re-replication is required for replication. The current model proposes early TAg causes S entry for replication, but BKV requires host S for replication. Canonical licensing and firing mechanisms were necessary for re-replication, with expected activity across the cell cycle. These findings change the understanding of BKV's life cycle, requiring initial S for robust TAg and viral production. Late gene expression showed VP2/3 followed robust TAg as cells progressed to re-replication, suggesting infectious virions formed in replicating cells. This aligns with BKV's life cycle where TAg precedes late proteins, but replication after cell reaches 4N.
Researchers have developed a novel transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) fine-mapping method called FIO to identify genes associated with binary traits, such as diseases. Unlike existing methods, FIO models all genes on a chromosome simultaneously to capture correlations between genes, increasing its power. FIO uses a probit model to link genetically regulated expression to binary outcomes, accounting for correlations among genes in linkage disequilibrium. This approach controls false discoveries and outperforms existing fine-mapping methods. Simulations evaluated FIO's performance and applied it to six binary traits in the UK Biobank dataset, reducing the size of causal sets by 27.9-36% over existing approaches. FIO prioritized genes associated with diseases, including GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension. FIO is an effective tool for TW fineapping binary traits.
This study investigates the role of Btn2 and Hsp protein sequeases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress. Oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure is known to inhibit translation and increase protein misfolding and aggregation. The absence of Btn and Hsp sequeases results in increased protein aggregation, suggesting they play a role in sequestering proteins formed during oxidative conditions. Hsp104 is required to protect against aggregation during oxidative stress, but its concentration remains unchanged, leading to the hypothesis that H104 may be limiting in Btn Hsp mutants. The study identifies Btn and Hsp sequeases as chaperones required for oxidant tolerance, sequestering misfolded proteins into PQC sites following ROS exposure. Proper sequestration prevents dysfunction and toxicity associated with protein misolding diseases. Btn and Hsp mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, implicating a role in oxidant tolerance. Data shows Btn and H sequeases protect against amorph and amyloid aggregation during oxidative conditions. Oxidative damage levels are similar in wild-type and sequease mutants, but aggregation is elevated, indicating Btn and H seases sequester oxidatively damaged proteins as part of antioxidant defense.
Researchers conducted a CRISPR-interference (CRISPR) screen to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with glioblastoma (GBM) invasion. They evaluated 2,307 lncRNAs and found 48 were significantly associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC45, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knockdown and was associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNA analysis revealed WASF, implicated in tumor invasion, was correlated with LINC45 expression, while WAS knockdown was associated with decreased invasion. WAS overexpression rescued invasive function lost with LINC45 knock. The study identified LINC45, a previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion and its expression is associated with tumor grade and survival. Mechanistic studies suggest LINC may regulate WAS3 via RNA-seq.
Researchers investigated the brain's ability to assign probabilistic models to sequences of auditory stimuli using electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of stimuli generated by a stochastic process. A new clustering procedure was introduced to group EEG signals based on their likelihood, allowing for a more parsimonious model of the data. Unlike previous studies, this approach did not assume a specific class of models used by the brain to organize sequence regularities of stimuli, leaving the identification of the actual class used by the brain an open question. Employing this method, regularities matching the algorithm used to generate the sequence were extracted from EEG data. The sequence generation process was defined by a context and a family of transition probabilities to choose the next stimulus given the past sequence at each step. Results showed that the brain uses the occurrence of regularities of a stochastic auditory sequence to select a model of a random sequence.
Researchers have identified a limitation in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, a method used to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, which fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcript-size (total number of transcripts per cell) and cell dissociation/processing-induced crypt gene expression. This is particularly problematic when analyzing heterogeneous solid tissues/ organs, requiring dissociation for analysis, resulting in a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq results and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF) is proposed. The concept and method of its computation are introduced, and cWFs are calculated for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs. Their fidelity is validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc-se data and cWF of composite cells. Additionally, cWF effectively predict progression, implicating diagnostic applications and association with aging. This study provides a method to solve limitations of sc-se analysis of solid tissues/organs and suggests utility and biological significance ofWF.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Genetic variants giving outlying estimates are considered potentially pleiotropic. Radial plots can help identify these variants, but analogous plots for MVM have been unavailable due to the multidimensional nature. A radial formulation of MVM and adapted radial plot are proposed, allowing the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. RadialM includes option for removal of outlying SNPs violating M assumptions. AVMR package is presented for implementing methods. Simulations and analyses demonstrate effectiveness of radialM. Outliers can be visualized and removed through radialM, decreasing bias in effects under pleiotropy. RadialM is applied to estimate effect of lipid on coronary disease.
Researchers studied the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species, by recording their movements at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in a controlled environment. They used a deep learning framework, SLE, to create a full-body pose dataset of 47 individuals, resulting in nearly 2 billion instances. The team identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion and used the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies' behavior varies across time and days in the experiment. They found distinct patterns in stereotyped behaviors, adding information about trends in grooming modalities, probis extension, and locom speed to what is known about the D melanogaster circadian cycle. The study found that the hour after dawn is a unique point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, and the composition of this hour tracks with other indicators of health such as locom speed and fraction of time spent resting. 

The team also found a decline in probis extension and locom speed as the fraction of time in idle increases across days, and identified the hour after as unique, tracking the general health of the flies. High-resolution data revealed differences in patterns during morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily in grooming behavior. The study found daily patterns in all behaviors, including grooming, probis extension, and locom speed, and a decline in difference between day and night hours across days as flies weaken and die, similar to weakening circadian rhythms with age.
Researchers have identified a novel function for the conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor PTP-22 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, establishing its role in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. A genetic screen found that loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in conserved NIMA kinases NE-2 and NE-3, which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. To understand P-22 functions, proximity studies identified candidate interactors of P-22 during development, revealing the CDC guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN-1 as an in vivo partner of P-22. Loss of DN- also suppressed ne-associated molting defects. Genetic and localization studies implicated P-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C elegans hemidesomes, suggesting P22 plays a role in maintaining tissue integrity. Proximity labeling also implicated P22 in functions connected nucleocytoplasm transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, nearly one-third of identified P22 proximity are gran components. These studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel functions.
Researchers have developed a statistical model to predict the spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, a crucial for malaria elimination efforts. Artemisinin is the current gold standard antimal drug, but resistance is expanding in Africa and India, threatening to increase malaria cases and deaths. Data on artem resistance are limited, making it difficult to prioritize control measures. The study used a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimal Resistance Network on non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian statistical model to create spatio-temporal predictions. Maps show expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 202, with most change between 2010 and 2015. The model provides insights into spatial and temporal trends oftem resistance not possible with data alone, enabling fine-scale decision support. The study predicts spatio patterns and extents oftem resistance at the subcontinent level, critical for malaria goals in Southeast Asia. 

A geostat model of molecular markers associated with artem resistance in the Kel 13 gene was developed, calibrated to the WWARN dataset. Spatio maps of K marker prevalence support resistance monitoring in Southeast, targeting strategies and elimination efforts. No fine-scale predictive maps exist fortem within Asia, but molecular markers offer a way forward. Historical samples have been reanalysed, providing significant data on prevalence. Predictive spatio-temp maps are presented for the first time of artem resistance in the Greaterong Subregion, providing estimates for locations with no data, guiding agencies to prioritise surveillance and policies.
Researchers have investigated the role of NLR1 and CARD8 proteins in the inflamome signaling pathway, which is crucial for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in different forms due to autoproteolysis within the FI domain, resulting in full-length (FL), cleaved N-terminal (NT), and cleaved C-terminal (CT) peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. The study found that NLR paralogs and CARD8 form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FLCT interactions with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 (mLR1) plays a role in forming NT-CT autohibitory, while Z5 of rat NLR1 and CARD8 mediate NT-CT interaction. Dipeptid peptidase 9 (D9) was also explored in these complexes, revealing interactions and significance of domain. D9 forms FL-CT complex and interacts with NT of mLR1, r1 and CARD through Z5, forming NT-D9-CT; however, D9 cannot bind NT of hLR1. Functional assays showed D9 is involved in NT-CT of rodent NLR and CARD but does not influence inhibitory activity on CT. The study enhanced understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflamome autohibition and underscored complexity of interactions in immune response.
Researchers investigated the role of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wingelium. They found that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2 (eIF2), indicating the onset of prote stress in the ER. This is consistent with R1's proposed function as a regulator of ERostasis. The study also showed that R1 is localized to the ER and cis-Golgi compartments. Mutations in the rer gene were first identified in yeast, where it was required for proper transport of Secp between the ER and Golgi. In Dophila, loss of R1 creates prote stress in the wingel, and when surrounded by wild-type cells, the population of rer mutant cells attained the loser fate and were eliminated via cell competition. R1 levels were found to be upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth under prote stress. The results suggest that increased R1 levels provide cytoprotection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating prote stress and supporting overgrowth. The study demonstrates R1 as a novel regulator of proteasis in Dophila and its role in competitive survival.
Researchers investigated the impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3,188 amino acid changes resulting from SNVs in CHE2 have not been tested for their effect on the function of the CHE2-encoded protein (CHK2). The study used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test the ability of 4,887 possible SNVs in the CHE2 reading frame to complement a yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. Among the non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlate with previous structure and function data and provide a new functional assay for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. This approach can help predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants found in screening and be applied to other cancer genes.
Streptococcus pneumoniae forms epigenetically and phenotypically distinct populations through Psr-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase genes in the opacity-determin cod locus, resulting in a switch between opaque and transparent colonies. The epigen patterns confer pathogenesis traits, but the mechanism controlling hS orientations is unknown. The Spx1-TA toxin-antitox system regulates hS orientations and epigen traits by targeting pneumoc protein synthesis. Spx1 and Ten constitute a conserved type II system in S pneumonia. Overexpressing Ten leads to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S pneumonia, while antit Spx1 represses spxA-ten transcription. Ten binds ribosome factor Rim, reducing Com expression, which activates transformation genes. Com attenuation enhances invertase psr, favoring transparent phase hS configurations. Moderate Ten expression reshapes pneumoc epigen and opacity. Spontaneous variations in the promoter region generate subpopulations with epetic and phenic diversity.
High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is desirable to compare datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns in one condition. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this as they operate on one dataset. Contrastive Principal Component Analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this problem but has little adoption due to requiring a hyperparameter with multiple solutions, no knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA foreground and background conditions are treated differently, making it unsuitable to compare conditions symmetrically. Generalized Contrastive PCA (gcPCA) is developed, a hyperparameter-free approach solving these problems. gc avoids hyperparameter requirement by introducing a normalization factor mitigating bias toward high-variance. gc finds dimensions exhibiting largest changes between conditions by examining covariance structure. gc builds on contrast PCA but solves key problem of hyperparameter requirement. gc addresses subtle questions, such as subsets exhibiting increased correlations in condition A than B or subsets up/downregulated in cells A than B. Mathematically, corresponds to dimensions accounting for variance A in B. Contrast PCA was proposed to address problem but has little adoption due to hyperparameter requirement. gc eliminates this by normalizing bias toward high-variance. gc finds dimensions exhibiting largest changes between conditions by examining covariance. gc builds on PCA but solves key problem of hyper requirement. gc addresses questions such as subsets exhibiting correlations in A than B or subsets upregulated in A than B. Mathematically corresponds to dimensions accounting variance A in B.
Researchers have developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using perturbed phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The model revealed feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including negative cros from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of cros was verified in B and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by phosphoproteomics on ERK and ERK sites. The BL-2 network was transferable to BL-41 cells and also modeled B signaling in diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling, indicating B aberration does not cause major rewiring. A semi-quantitative network of BCR was established and tested in different cell lines to describe conserved B receptor signaling, which can be used as starting point for cell-specific networks. Phosphoprote analyses supported key model insights. The BL-2 network formed base to describe DLBCL with aberrant B signaling. Feedback and cros in ER and p38 were not found in studied cells, but conserved across B lymphoma types. Three novel connections improved the model: positive c from mTOR to JNK, positive from GSK to ZAP, and negative from p38 on RAF/ME/ER. A semi-quant model of BCR in BL-2 was used to assess general B signaling.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Notch receptor signaling network in tissue growth and maintenance, focusing on the opposing mechanisms that regulate its activity. Notch signaling is triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands in neighboring cells and inhibited by ligands binding to the same receptors in the cell. Different Notch/ligand combinations elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signaling. This study explores the molecular basis of Notch ligands DLL and JAG, which control angiogenic sprouting through a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches, providing evidence for two mechanisms: DLL induces efficient Notch receptor activation, while J1 blocks DLL-dependent inhibition through a J1/DLL complex formation. A new Notch signaling model recapitulates tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting. 

The study combines experimental and mathematical approaches to control Notch activity by DLL and J1, uncovering an overlooked role for heteromeric J1/DLL complexes enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. Data show heterom J1/DLL complex relieves Notch receptor inhibition, enabling efficient signaling. Experimental results suggest two factors underlie J1 antagonizing DLL for tip and stalk cell selection in sprouting. Consistent with findings, DLL homomers and DLL-J1 heteromers mediate Notch cis-inhibition. Angiogenic sprouting involves regulated interplay between Notch and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEF) receptor (VFR) signaling, based on results, a new DLL/J1-Notch model is proposed and a theoretical DLL/J1-Not-VEF model. A Notch signaling model incorporates the finding J1 antagonizes DLL through heterom DLL-J1 complexes underlying observed effects in sprouting.
Researchers have developed Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM), an extension of a Bayesian non-parametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points. They demonstrate that DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data and cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. The method can also be used to cluster gene datasets summarized using gene signatures. A novel procedure is introduced to generate a summary of a gene signature on a different dataset from where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three gene datasets containing patients with IMD were analyzed using relevant signatures, finding associations between disease and clusters replicated across datasets. This work shows that when data has uncertainty, it should be used to inform clustering and presents a method to do so, DPM. Additionally, a procedure is presented to use gene signatures in datasets other than where they were defined, showing value by summarizing gene data from patients with IMD using DPM. Clustering by engineered GWAS features recapitulates known relationships in IMD and suggests uses for clustering uncertainty, such as with polygenic scores where uncertainty can be exploited. A method is proposed to summarize gene expression across a signature, extending possible uses since signatures may be weaker on datasets with complex structure, taking variability into account. Ignoring uncertainty led to clusterings not associating with disease in two of nine examples. Gene signatures linked to IMD were identified from literature and clustered patients in three datasets, summarizing expression levels with mean and uncertainty. Bayesian methods offer advantages in conveying uncertainty and inferring number of clusters, adapting a Dirichlet process model to data with uncertainty, Dirlet Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM).
Deep neural networks have been successful models of the primate visual system, but fail to account for the importance of shape in primate vision. Humans judge category membership largely based on shape, while deep networks rely on color and texture. The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear. We created artificial datasets where shape, color, and texture can be used to predict class, and trained networks to classify with single features and combinations. Some architectures are unable to learn shape, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. The bias is due to interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent. Different algorithms with sparse, local changes make networks sensitive to shape and improve human vision.

 We used artificial images to investigate why deep networks classify with bias towards color and texture, instead of shape. Some architectures, like vision transformers, are structurally unable to learn shape, while convolutional networks develop bias despite learning shape-based classification. Changes to architecture won't enable shape recognition, but algorithm changes will. Our experiments show color and texture bias arise from gradient learning dynamics, specifically gradient alignment with classes. Breaking this requires changing gradients, except for spConv, all convolution networks show bias towards color or texture. We focus on ConvNet to understand bias. Networks can classify by shape, but fail shape-based if color or texture predicts class. We compared human and network learning on shape, color, object, or patch features. Humans rely on shape, networks on color or size. We investigate why networks fail shape classification. This is for color and texture networks, not shape networks. We hypothesize gradient dynamics explain bias. Reducing alignment enables shape classification.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the dynamics of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and their role in liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic diseases. The model, based on the Kappa language, represents HSC as agents with seven physiological states interacting with TGFβ molecules, which regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, a main component of the extracellular matrix. Simulations revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion, with inactivation allowing elimination of activated HSC during reversion and reactivation of inactivated HSC (iSC) sustaining fibrosis. The model's sensitivity to TGF parameters suggests adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions. Experimental data from a mouse model of CCl-induced liver fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts accumulation of iSC during chronic liver disease. RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated liverrosis confirmed this, identifying iSC as novel markers of fibrosis. The study provides the first model of H dynamics in chronic disease, exploring the role of iSC in liver homeostasis and can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework to estimate the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex traits and diseases, in large-scale genomic consortia like the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program. The method, called Meta2, uses summary statistics and allows for inter-study heterogeneity and is more computationally efficient than individual-level analysis when there is no heterogeneity. It was applied to 5 TOP studies with 580 participants to estimate the mediation of gene expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The method is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub. Meta-analysis is an alternative to individual-level analysis in terms of feasibility and can evaluate heterogeneity across factors like genomic technologies, as shown in application to Framingham Heart Study and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. Meta can characterize overall effect and individual mediators. The analysis adjusted for covariates like BMI, sex, age, smoking, drinking, race, expression platform, cohort, and top PCs of gene data. Meta led to different estimates and 95% CIs from individual analysis due to reasons.
Researchers have developed a novel method called PWH to identify driver genes responsible for cancer development in individual patients, taking into account the heterogeneity of driver events across patients. Unlike existing methods, PWH prioritizes mutated genes based on their impact on downstream gene expression in a group of patients sharing co-mutations and similar gene profiles. Experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCG showed PWH excelled in identifying known and tumor-specific drivers, outperforming individual and cohort-level methods. PWH also identified common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improved tumor stratification and understanding of heterogeneity, a step towards personalized treatment. One predicted gene, low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP1), was validated to promote tumor proliferation in vitro assays. Existing methods overlooked that patients with same driver mutations share carcinogenic mechanisms, unlike those with same passengers. PWH incorporates higher-order relationships between mutated and abnormally expressed genes, improving driver prediction. Despite limitations, PWH demonstrated reliable performance inferring drivers, promising obscured by heterogeneity. Future, PWH will aid personalized treatment development. PWH is a genome/transcript analysis identifying candidate drivers by leveraging mutated influence on networks across samples. Samples with same cancer type display similarity compared to different types. Leveraging samples from same type, closely resembling target, improves prediction. PWH requires knowledge of samples, somatic mutation, and expression, and interaction. For each type, predicted drivers were compared to other methods on overlap with known drivers. The number of drivers identified is illustrated for each type.
Researchers have developed a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy, called the Virtual Epileptic (VEP), which combines anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities to generate spatio-temporal seizure patterns resembling those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG. This allows for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. The study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach called SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions without excessive time. Benchmarking on synthetic data, the proposal successfully solved different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and performance against parallel solvers. Results were enhanced using Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning, with gains in accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, a scalable uncertainty quantification phase was added to the model to assess variability in parameters across problems. This study has potential to improve estimation of brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health issue with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung, but estimates of Mtb replication and death rates in lungs of infected animals, such as monkeys or rabbits, are largely unknown. Experiments were conducted with rabbits infected with a virulent clinical M isolate of the Beijing lineage, H878, carrying plasmid p10. In vitro, p10 was found more stable in H878 than the commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37R (segregation coefficient = 0.1 in H878 vs 0.18 in H37). The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in M-infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline; the percent plid cells increased between 28-56 post-infection and remained 84-112 post-in despite a large increase in numbers in lung at late points. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monot change in percent plid cells can be explained by a lung M population of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics: one expanding early and controlled/eliminated, while a smaller expanding at times causing a counterintuitive increase in percentid cells. A model with kinetically homogeneous M population could not explain data when run stochastically. Given H878 forms circumscribed granomas, results suggest independent dynamics in granomas.
Researchers have developed a computational tool called GlycanModeler, also known as GlyTreeer, to predict and determine the structure of glycans, which are carbohydrate molecules attached to proteins. Glycans play a crucial role in various biological functions, but their structure is difficult to determine experimentally. Glycaner uses kernel density estimates of common glycan conformations from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The tool was tested on various glycan structures and showed high accuracy in both de novo modeling and density-guided building. Glycaner was used to design glycans into a nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions from antibody recognition, experimentally verified. This work will aid glycoprotein prediction, glycan modeling, and structure determination.

Glycobiology tools have been developed for protein glycosylation, structural validation, analysis, and docking. Traditional glycop modeling involves molecular dynamics or manual placement into density. Recent tools focus on density-guided building, especially for resolved glycans like HIV. Glycaner was tested for density-guided modeling and decoy discrimination using integrated scoring. Automated glycop modeling must sample chemistries, branching, and kinematics to build glycans into unknown density.

Glycaner and tools model glycans through de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm was optimized with glycans of varying length and complexity, with a median RMS of 2.7.7. Rosetta protocols continue to be optimized, and deep learning becomes integral, SimpleMetrics will analyze new results and Rosetta. Glycaner accurately predicts glycan de novo, builds into density, and uses Sugarcoat protein surfaces.
In the fungus Penicillium oxalicum, the ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF (Skp-Cull-F-box) complex plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality control through ubiquitination. The Skp-Cull-F-box complex recognizes substrates via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate, with the F-box determining substrate specificity. However, the limited number of identified ubiquitin-ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field. In P. oxalic, the transcription factor Ace1 (also known as Slt) is positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively with the expression of hemi-cellulase genes. The ubiquitinase-substrate pair SCFbx-Ace1 is identified in P. oxum, with most PoF23 present in the free form within the nucleus and a small portion associating with Sk1 to form the PoF23-Skp heterodimer. Under glucose signal, Po23 absence results in decreased transcription of the brA gene, which encodes the master regulator of asexual development and spore pigmentation genes, and impaired conidiation. Under cellulose, transcription of hemi-cellase genes in the mutant are significantly upregulated. Po23 acts as a transcription coactivator, recognizing and activating Ace, allowing it to regulate transcription of target genes with different effects under signals. Po23 deletion does not affect Ace transcription but results in accumulation of all versions of the Ace protein. Accumulated Ace is dysfunctional, no longer binding to promoters of target genes including cellulase cb1, eg1, hemicellase x11, and pigmentation abB.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the formation and diversification of the basement membrane (BM) in Drosophila melanogaster's follicular epithelium. They found that two parallel protein secretion routes, mediated by Rab10 and Rab8, are essential for BM production. Rab10 promotes lateral and planar-polarized secretion, while Rab8 promotes basal secretion, leading to the formation of fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. The dystroph-associated protein complex (DAP) and Rab10 are present in a plan-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins, with DAP being essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab route. The exocyst complex has a dual function: it interacts with dystroph to limit plan polarization and is required for the Rab8 route. These findings highlight the mechanistic aspects of BM secretion and how diversity can emerge from spatial control of distinct routes. The study proposes the coexistence of parallel secretory routes with cell sites defined by polarity as a mechanism for BM diversification during development.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which are crucial for HIV treatment. The model, called language-based universal model (LB), uses multi-task learning (MTL) to improve predictions and address two challenges: underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes in current datasets and combinations of Abs required to avoid resistance to a single Ab. MTl mitigates bias against underrepresented subtypes and allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance between Abs, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimal Ab combinations. The LB model was trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with non-Ab and Ab data, outperforming classical machine learning algorithms, random forests and gradient boosting. The study's aim was not only to predict HIV-1 resistance to 33 Abs, but to address key challenges in HIV-1 research. The model's performance is expected to increase with more data and diversity. The model is publicly available for adaptation to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow, with varying treatment effects between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for therapeutic decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that pathway dysfunction is associated with disease progression. This study considered two strategies constructing predictive models taking pathway information into account: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. Pathway score method converted gene expression to sample-wise scores for fitting, using three methods (ssSEA, GS, GS, and z-scores) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. Implemented in microarray data MM (GSE324), a candidate model with best performance in validation was obtained. Compared to gene-based model and published models in external data, grouplasso incorporating pathway information (Vax) outperformed in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including V pathways, was more predictive for MM. V also outperformed previously models, and was more resistant to missing values, with presence <5% not deteriorating accuracy using imputation method. Pathway-based models using grouplasso were competitive to gene-based for MM, documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM), with imputation integrated for future validation.
Researchers have developed a nonlinear dynamical systems model to study the process of mitochondrial fission, which is the division of a mitochondrion into two daughter organelles. The model focuses on the role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Dr1) in this process, which is crucial for cellular response to injury. A key parameter, μ, representing the maximum rate of disassembling of oligomers, was identified as a key regulator of the total fission rate (TFR) and cumulative fission (TF). The model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with parameter μ = k + k - M, where M is the concentration of mitochondrial fission factor, and k+ and k are association and dissociation constants between oligomers on the outer membrane. Surprisingly, TF does not monotonically increase with μ, instead increasing to a point and then decreasing as μ continues. This non-monotonic dependence suggests that targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive effects on fission. The study aims to understand the impact of regulatory parameters like μ for future therapeutic selection.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-based gene drive system to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests by targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosoph suuk, a notorious pest. The system uses three gRNAs to induce nonfunctional mutations at desired sites, reducing selective pressure for resistance. A key feature is the ability to restore egg-laying defects in T2 mutant females by feeding octamine, allowing easier maintenance of the drive. The system was tested in Dros melanogaster and improved by introducing promoter-C9 transgenes to enhance homing efficiency. However, genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene alleles and Cas9 activity is influenced by position. This study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing female infertility caused by the drive, offering a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.
Researchers have found that the brain's energy consumption is not only limited by the energy required for computation, but also by the energy needed to form and maintain memories. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks, which require only a few synaptic updates, have a significant metabolic cost. In contrast, tasks like achieving 95% accuracy on MNIST require at least 108 synaptic updates, suggesting the brain has evolved to learn with minimal energy. To explore this, the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks, a parsimonious energy model was proposed. Two plasticity algorithms were introduced to save energy: 1) modifying only synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. Vanilla backpropagation updates all synapses, but restricting plasticity can save energy while incurring slightly worse learning time.

An energy measure was introduced, assuming energy is used solely by synaptic updates, showing a square root relation between energy and size, M ∝ N0.43.43. Large networks learn faster but use more energy, restricting plasticity can save. To examine, plasticity was allowed in a random subset of synapses using a binary mask, drawn from Bernoulli distribution. Skipping uninformative samples during learning also saves energy. Future studies include adapting algorithms to task or architecture and efficient synaptic modification during transfer. The model can be refined with more data and efficiency re-examined. Energy for neural signaling, such as transmission and generation, was not considered.
Researchers investigated how laboratory evolution can overcome fitness defects caused by genome streamlining in the bacterium Acinetobacter bayi AD1x, which had deletions of 22-42 kilobase and 70-293obase regions. Populations of AD1x and each deletion strain were evolved for ~300 generations in chemically minimal and complex media, and genomes of endpoint isolates were sequenced. Fitness increased in all cases except two, which failed to improve in one environment. Mutations in protein-coding genes and small RNAs were associated with environments and deletions. Global transcription regulators, ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq, were mutated across strains, with varied effects on function and fitness. Mutations in this network likely compensated for earlier deletion in ADx ancestor, restoring csr function. Results show fitness lost during streamlining can be regained through evolution, often through deletion-specific and regulatory adjustments.
Researchers have developed a self-cleaving ribyme tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebraf, a vertebrate model organism. They inserted the T3-H ribyme in the intron of a reporter gene and observed a 20-fold reduction in expression, outperforming other ribymes. The ribyme was then inserted in the albino gene using CRISPR/Cas and induced a pigmentation similar to the mutant. Using base-editing, the ribyme was inactivated and the phenotype reversed, demonstrating specificity. A Flipp- and Cre-activatable version, Ribo, was generated to control mRNA levels of alb, inducing knockdown and recapitulating the mutant phenotype. Additionally, a Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in Ribo labeled cells independently of target expression. The Ribo cassette is introduced as a flexible tool for controlling endogenous expression in vertebrates, an alternative to existing knockdown strategies.
Researchers have developed a user-friendly software called "aiSEG" that can segment nuclei from bright field (BF) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the need for transgenic or fluorescent labeling, freeing up imaging channels, reducing phototoxicity, and speeding up imaging. The software uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structures in transmitted light images, which was previously only possible under optimized conditions. aiSEG accurately segments nuclei from challenging BF images, similar to manual segmentation, retaining biologically relevant information for quantification of biosensors signaling pathway dynamics. It is adaptable to new cases with only 32 images for retraining and accessible through command line and graphical user interface. The software is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user coding experience. aiSEG was evaluated on 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images from curated and novel data sets, including primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities. It performed well in prevalent conditions such as low magnification and time lapse imaging of cells, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with large cytoplasm. Features associated with the nucleus were more important than whole cell or neighborhood, confirmed by interpreting aiSEG segmentations with Grad-CAM. Removing fluorescent channel for segmentation enables additional markers and improved workflows. Segmentations are based on BF rich information about cells, interactions and subcellular structures, crucial for assembling data for retraining.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments. One such property is the rate of change, as behaviorally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. They tested whether humans are biased to learn when task-relevant features change slowly rather than quickly. In two experiments and a preregister replication, 295 participants learned rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either the band's relevant feature changed slowly or quickly. Results showed participants accrued more reward when the relevant feature changed slowly and the irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite. No difference was found in generalizing to unseen values between conditions. A set of four function approximation Kalman models revealed participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted to relevance and speed. The improvement in performance for slow bandits compared to fast was strongly related to adjusted learning rates. These results suggest humans favor slower features, indicating a bias in reward learning.
Researchers have identified a gene called Res1 as a novel metastasis gene in ER-negative breast cancer, which is associated with poor prognosis and rapid progression to metastatic disease. Using a mouse genetics approach, they found that reducing Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and more lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Analysis of primary and metastatic tissues showed loss of wild-type Res1, suggesting it acts as a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic studies revealed Res1's role in transcriptional control through association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly ribosomal biogenesis, indicating loss enhances tumor progression through transcriptional and translational alterations. Previous studies identified 5 genes on chromosome 6 associated with metastasis, and Res1 was found to be one of them, with lower expression linked to worse outcomes in human breast cancer data. The Res1 gene is poorly characterized, producing a 152 amino acid product from a single exon. A Res1 knockout mouse bred with PyMT model showed reduced Res1 increased metastatic disease and pulmonary metastases.
Researchers investigated the roles of the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that loss of Rad24 resulted in severely impacted spore viability and reduced recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies, while loss of Mec1 increased recombination frequency and had less effect on spore viability. However, complex chromosomal events initiated by closely spaced DSBs in wild-type cells occurred more frequently in the absence of either Rad or Mec, suggesting loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation. Both Mec and Rad have roles in spatial regulation of crossovers (COs), with loss of either resulting in more random CO distributions, suggesting reductions in global interference. These effects are similar to but less extreme than the phenotype of 'MM mutants such as zip3, and may be driven by reductions in proportion of interfering COs. In addition to shared roles in CO regulation, results highlight separable roles for Rad as a pro-CO factor and for Mec as regulator of recombination, loss helping to suppress broader defects in CO caused by abrogation of DDR.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the growth and metabolism of Pneumocyst jirovec, a deadly fungus that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, due to its inability to be cultured in vitro. The model, a comprehensive in silico-scale genome metabolic model, identifies metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro. Using published data and bioinformatics tools, the model was developed and validated, and Flux Balance and Reinforcement Analysis were employed to predict metabolic fluxes and critical components of Pneumyst growth. The findings provide insights into the biology of Pneumyst and a strategy to overcome culturing the pathogen vitro. A genome-scale model was also developed for Pneumyst murina, a mouse-specific pathogen, for practical and ethical reasons. Predictions were made regarding Pyst growth and metabolism, including medium components and supplements to enhance growth. The model replicated drop and knockout experiments, highlighting its potential in antifungal drug development. The lack of vitro methods has hindered Pyst research, with diagnosis relying on microscopic detection in specimens. Combining in sil modelling and experimental phenotyping opens opportunities to release this bottleneck. The inability to culture Pyst has resulted in lack of data on composition, physiological characteristics, nutrient uptake, and enzymatic activities, hindering model development.
Researchers investigated whether increased levels of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PD binding motif (TAZ) (YAP/TA) are sufficient to induce sustained proliferation in cancer cells, even at high cell densities where the Hippo pathway, which regulates Y/TA, is activated, leading to cell cycle arrest. They developed a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hipp-Y/TA pathway, introducing a novel component that reflects cell density dynamics into the Hipp pathway. The model simulated cell interactions using molecular dynamics (MD) equations with adhesion and repulsive forces, friction, and Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential with a soft core, allowing each cell to secure its domain. Cell cycles were composed of mitotic and growth phases under cell kinetics. Simulations at various Y/TA levels showed a twofold increase in Y/TA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cycle arrest and continue proliferating under high-density conditions. The model, combining cell interactions and Hipp-YTA pathway, may evaluate cancer malignancy based on YTA levels, develop drugs to suppress abnormal proliferation, and determine drug dosages.
Researchers have investigated the role of low-complexity domains (LCD) in biomolecules, which have a tendency to form molecular condensates. Mutations in LCD can disrupt condens dynamics, leading to pathological transitions to solid-like states. To understand how LCD sequence governs condens dynamics, an energy framework was developed using a'stickiness' scale instead of explicit sequences. Sequences were characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to random counterparts. The framework maps material and dynamical properties governed by energy features modulated by LCD complexity, including periodicity and disorder. Periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. Results show minimum periodicity is crucial for fluidity, avoiding transitions to glass or solid states. The framework explains experimental findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condens viscoelasticity. A Free Landscape of Stickers (ELS) model was introduced for phase-separ biomolecules, employing a continuous'stick' scale to investigate effects of low-complex patterns on condens dynamics and properties. Structural and dynamical implications of patterns influence evolutionary development of phasepar biomolecules. The study addresses the role of complexity in governing dynamics and material of biomolecular condates, providing a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties. Using ELS, complexity of patterns quantified periodicity and disorder impact dynamics and properties of condates. The framework aligns with experimental findings on pr domains and predicts alterations in viscoelastic through periodic variations.
Researchers investigated the development of ectodermal organs, specifically focusing on the formation of stratified epithelial placodes that invaginate into the mesenchyme to form organs. They used the mouse dentition as a model and found that non-mus myosin II is essential for epithelial invagination, promoting cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by inducing myos II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AK and myos II rescued defects caused by inhibition of Sh. The study supports a model where Sh signal is transmitted through my II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination. Sh is required for narrowing the dental epithelium at the neck and invagination, and does so through promotion of My II activity. Results show Sh signals through PIK/AKT and My in the epithelium to maintain cell-adhesion and promote convergent cell movement driving invagination. This is achieved by strengthening cell-adhesion at adherens junctions and enabling persistent convergent movement in the supasal layer. Sh acts through PI/A to activate My. The Sh-PI/A-My axis promotes cell-adhesion and movement propelling invagination. My II generates forces and maintains intercellular adhesion, perturbations in My mutants impede convergent narrowing and invagination. The study highlights the importance of My in maintaining cell-adhesion in stratified epithelium, consistent with prior findings that My-generated forces are essential for adherence in cultured cells.
Researchers have leveraged large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin accessibility data to gain insights into complex biological mechanisms. However, current label transfer methods have limitations in preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. To address this, a deep transfer model called single-cell graph convolutional network (scGCN) is proposed, achieving high performance in preserving biological variation and integrating thousands of cells in minutes with low memory. scGC integrates multimodal data from ATAC-seq and C-seq, showing high transfer accuracy and knowledge across modalities. To improve robustness, a multistage learning strategy is used, integrating gene and chromatin data into a unified cell atlas. The model is a novel approach enabling analysis of large-scale single-cell multiomics, combining different measurements, even unpaired data. It aggregates cell relationships and gene expression with convolution, based on regulatory mechanisms between RNA and AT-seq. MK-MD-based adaption enables leveraging domain effects. Multiple kernels adapt representations enhance effectiveness between RNA-se and AT-se embeddings. scGC accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets, tissues, species, and molecular layers, RNA-se and AT-se.
Researchers have characterized the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Mc3 subunit of the replicative helicase, a protein essential for cell growth, through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF) modeling. They found that precise positioning of basic residues within the LS is critical for nuclear transport through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear import of Mc3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the M complex and poor growth. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, lacking a universally conserved sequence, which retain shared characteristics with the LS of Mc3 and SV40 large antigen. Further characterization of Mc's LS will elucidate cell-dependent nuclear import and loading, and refine predictions of putative NLS in many proteins. Mutagenesis identified basic residues in Mc's LS critical for function, particularly P2 and P3, which interact with importin. Mutations at P2 or P result in defective import, chromatin association, and impaired growth. Unexpectedly, Mc3SV-NLS mutant fails nuclear import despite AF predicting contacts with Kap at P and P. Constitutive localization observed in full-length and C-terminal Mc lacking NES. Defective import may compromise MCM loading, leading to growth defects.
Ataxin-2 (ATN) is a protein implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinsonism, and is a therapeutic target for ALS-related conditions. The protein functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and assembly of mR-granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm-like domain of At2 can stimulate mRNA translation and antagonize mR-grule assembly. This study advances previous findings through experiments on Drosoph and human Atin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified (TRIBE) and co-localization immunoprecipitation indicate the poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 is a major determinant of mRNA and protein content in Atin-2R granules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila show the At-LS domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At2-induced cytotoxicity. The data propose howin interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of R-gran condensation and neurodegeneration.

Across species, Atin-2 has conserved regions: LSm (Sm), L-associated (SmAD), and P2 motif, flanked by IDRs. Work in Doph has shown the c-terminal IDR ofin is required for R assembly into granules. This study further elaborates mechanisms ofin functions in mRNA and R assembly. The P2 ofin and interactions with AB are essential for gran but required to recruitin-target RNAs and protein intoin gran. RNA proteins can associate with RNAs multiple stages: processing, transport, translation, or control. Atin may be such. It is translational activator of Doph period, repressor several reporters, facilitator of R-gran and stress-gran, and stabilizer associated RN. Previous showedin mutants lacking IDR forin gran in Doph and S cells were resistant to neurode. The L-domain antagonizesin gran. This tested the conserved ofin, P2, associated with AB, in this process. Used Galts-controlled el-G4 to expressin-2P2AD in Doph brains 5 days and RNA-Seq identified RN in poly selected and compared within procedures.
Researchers investigated the role of gene regulatory networks in the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different anatomical locations, specifically the extraocular muscles (EOM) and limb muscles. They used genetically modified mice to study the spatiotemporal roles of Pit2 and Pax in the emergence and maintenance of OM progenitor population. The study provided a comprehensive characterization of myogenesis from embryonic to postnatal stages in vivo and identified differential states, dynamics, commitment, and quiescence of OM stem cells compared to limb muscles. Deletion of Pax in adult stem cells resulted in reduced numbers and impaired regeneration following injury, while Pax was dispensable for OM formation during embryonic development. However, presence of stem cells in OM postnatal Pax null mice and roles of Pax and Pit2 in these cells remained unresolved. Expression of Pit2 in postnatal stem was higher in OM than limb muscles. Despite uniform acquisition of myogenic fate, heterogeneity characterized embryonic cells in anatomical locations. Conditional inactivation Pit2 in neural-crest cells did not affect OM specification, but resulted in muscle patterning defects. Temporal requirement for Pit2 during lineage was demonstrated: deletion in progenitors resulted in absence myofib and cells, while in mylast did not. In trunk, and deromyome and limb, expression Pax and My5 preceded Pax, with Pax rapidly downregulated myogenic commitment. Following establishment muscle anlagen, Pax expressed mid-embry in undifferentiated and persisted adult stem. The study proposes a relay between Pit2, My5, and Pax for OM cell maintenance.
Researchers have developed a novel algorithm, called VOC-IN, to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population. This algorithm combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission of COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. VOC-IN emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve optimization and achieve accurate fitting. Variants exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease, severity, immune evasion, and responsiveness to treatments. According to the WHO's definition, VOCs represent major evolutionary advancements necessitating substantial public health measures. To evaluate risk, simulating transmission within the population and time-dependent characteristics of SARS-2 variants is crucial.

The researchers integrated Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PIN) with infectious models, particularly VOC-IN, represents a significant contribution. VOC-IN leverages observational data and physical principles governing disease to capture time-vary nature of parameters. Studies have shown PIN can accurately fit compartment models and estimate time-vary parameters. Inspired by these, VOC-IN method fits data and infers complex time-vary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiological mechanisms, and ODE into neural networks.

The VOC-IN algorithm was tested on reported data from British Columbia, Canada, fitting the data accurately and simulating unobserved dynamics, time-dependent parameters, and enabling short-term predictions. Experimental results revealed variations in control strategies across regions. VOC-IN performed well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data. The researchers aim to integrate VOC-IN with other machine-learning methods to better predict infectious data.
Researchers have developed a new method called CytoNet, a deep learning-based approach that improves the accuracy of image-based cell profiling by 30-68% compared to the traditional method of averaging cell populations. This is because averaging fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations. CytoNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple instance learning framework, making it easier to apply to single-cell data than previous strategies. The model achieves this by downweighting small cells or debris and prioritizing crowded cells. It only requires perturbation labels for training, which are available in all profiling datasets. CytoNet offers a post-processing step for single profiles that significantly boosts performance on image-based datasets. 

CytoNet is a self-supervised contrast learning approach that leverages information in profiling experiments. Contrast learning brings similar points together while pushing others apart in a space, capturing general features for tasks. Here, it's applied to single features, not raw pixels, making it applicable to most profiling datasets. Data is treated as sets of cells, each sample corresponding to a set based on mathematical definition. Deep Sets are used to learn a model that aggregates data into a profile, outperforming population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound's mechanism.
Researchers have developed a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns. The framework relies on identifying discrete dynamical states (microstates) and optimal transport theory. To validate its effectiveness, they applied it to a dataset from a spatial Stro task, a cognitive test where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting aspect. Results showed increased cost linked to cognitive effort, confirming the framework's ability to capture and quantify transitions. This study bridges the gap between brain activity, effort, and performance by providing a data-driven method to describe cognitive effort within the brain. 

A stochastic framework was used to measure brain cost in an existing EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and demand during the Stro task. This is the first application of such a framework to EEG, providing a pipeline to quantify demand in EEG experiments. The method was generalized to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly than fMRI. An EEG dataset of participants performing Stro was analyzed. A similar approach was applied to an fMRI dataset of participants performing various tasks, showing varying cost from resting to tasks. However, tasks were qualitatively different and difficult to compare, with no prior expectations of difficulty or demand. This study investigates changes during tasks and if cost explains brain energy needs for differing demands. Other metrics quantify cognitive loads from microanalysis, such as entropy or Hurst exponents, lack clear interpretation regarding costs, not accounting for dynamics.
Researchers investigated the role of atypical memory B cells (aBC) in the immune response to Plasmodium vivax (P. viv) malaria infection. They generated probes to detect and study the development and persistence of P. viv-specific aBC and their ability to produce neutralizing antibodies. The study found that P. viv infections elicited the development and persistence of P. viv-specific aBC, which accumulated during and after infections and might play a role in producing antibodies against malaria. Among the aBC clones, A12 and B11 produced neutralizing antibodies against a panel of P. viv variants. Notably, the B cell receptors of P. viv-specific aBC expressed unique IGH genes, similar to classical BC. The somatic hypermutation rate and CDR length of VH and V in these BC subsets were not different. The findings highlight a role of aBC in humoral response to malaria by differentiating into ASC for broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. viv invasion into erythrocytes. Identifying BC subsets that play a major role in producing antibodies will facilitate development of effective and lasting malaria vaccines. The study demonstrated generation of antigen-specific aBC in P. viv infections and their competency to secrete antibodies against variant antigens.
Researchers have developed a new method called MR-MASHS, an extension of the MR-MASH model, that uses summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel instead of individual-level data. This makes MRASH more applicable to datasets that are not publicly available and scalable to biob-size data. Simulations showed that MRASHS is competitive and often outperforms current methods for single and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios with different patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, number of variants, and heritability. A real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UKBiobank showed MRASH achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for most traits, especially with smaller sample size datasets. MRASH requires individual data due to privacy concerns and doesn't scale to large datasets like biobanks, limiting its use in polygenic prediction. MRASHS addresses these limitations by using summary statistics and LD estimates. MRASH learns patterns of effect across phenotypes, models dozens jointly, and is computationally efficient.
Researchers have developed a novel modeling framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases by incorporating spatial and temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models. They introduced a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles and approximated the recruitment rate using a neural network to develop a Universal Differential Equations (DE) model. The model was trained using deep learning methods and calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods with data from the COVID-19 Omic variant outbreak in Shanghai. The model projected an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to homogeneous model projections of 99.97 and 32.78%, providing an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. Simulations showed heterogeneity in susceptibles decreased herd immunity by 37.36% and prolonged the outbreak by 30-70 days, aligning with real data. The study lays groundwork for new models and insights on heterogeneity.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain exhibit high levels of noise, which is surprising given their high energy consumption. They propose that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework was developed where the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment, dynamic. This suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by a learning rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms. Synapses utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. Each syn predicts somatic dynamics, but emergent dynamics of many synapses in a network resolve problems like classification and closed-loop control in dynamic environments. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties in network behaviorally ambiguous situations.

The study shows synapses can exploit noise to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. A model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode somatic potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity in post-spike protocols and weight dependence. A synaptic learning rule is derived by minimizing surprise in synapses, adapting efficacy to predict postsyn spikes by backpropagating action potentials. Synaptic variability reflects uncertainty in neural firing. Postsyn learns to fire according to Gaussian distributions with different spreads. Variability in firing is reflected in spiking learning. During stochastic firing, high trial-to-trial variability in membrane dynamics is observed. Synapses learn suitable responses as behaving in unknown environments, variability representing uncertainty about cellular state.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scup for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method addresses challenges of single-cell sequencing such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scup computes distances between cells and uses the neighbor-joining algorithm to reconstruct the tree. It is designed to be embarrassingly parallel, making it faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. The method's robustness is tested on synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells. Single-cell sequencing enables detailed analysis of development and differentiation. However, it comes with challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scup fits well with biological findings and obtains better accuracy. Reconstructing cell trees from single data is a fundamental problem with potential for studies of development and differentiation. There are two related problems for cancer: reconstruction of clonal trees and tumor phylogenies from single cells. Several data types have been used for these problems. However, mutations are scarce for healthy tissues implying sophisticated models and methods are needed. Single DNA sequencing reveals more mutations than other data, but comes with challenges. Scup is a distance-based method that reconstructs lineage from DNA data produced by amplification methods. It distinguishes somatic mutations from sequencing errors caused by amplification. A dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage topology is used to test the method. These cells are closely related, making it hard to reconstruct the true tree.
In low-income settings, healthcare systems face challenges in allocating limited resources to improve population health outcomes. Health benefits packages (HBPs) are used to determine which services the public healthcare system should provide, but analytic approaches to weigh evidence for interventions have limitations. This study proposes the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model, a tailored tool for evaluating Malawi HBs, addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modeling and calibrating country-specific data on disease incidence, health behavior, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under resource constraints, the authors simulated health gains under plausible HBP strategies. A linear optimization-based HBP achieved an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 compared to a benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, it incurred excess DALs in the first years. Other prioritization approaches, such as patient characteristics-based, achieved consistent gains relative to the benchmark and a 5% reduction over the period, suggesting this approach might be beneficial. The LO model provides a tool to test HBs specifically for Malawi, evaluating health gains from prioritizing services under realistic resource constraints, addressing limitations in other methods. Failure to capture effects results in overestimating health delivered by the system. This approach provides a balanced representation of Malawi's healthcare constraints and postpones analysis of factors to later work. The LO model simulates realistic healthcare delivery based on human resources and time for appointments, enforcing assumptions under a healthcare system approach.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpunctella, a species that diverged from the silkworm moth Bomby mor over 100 million years ago. Using oligo DNA FISH, they found that meiotic homolog pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, similar to previous findings in Bomby mor. Both species form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bomby, Plodia orients bivalents in multiple ways at metaph I. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of bivalent position, and are not paired, with four distinct kinetochores observed at metaph I. Microtubule attachments orient separated kinchores. These findings challenge the classical view of paired, pole-facing kinchores for accurate hom separation in meiosis. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model organisms, revealing novel biology.
Researchers have investigated the role of the median eminence (ME), a region at the base of the hypothalamus, in the development of hypopituitarism, a condition characterized by reduced pituitary hormone production. They found that mutations affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox result in hypopuitar, likely originating from the hypothalamus. The study shows that absence of SOX3 predominantly affects ME phenotypes in juvenile animals, despite embryonic onset of SOX expression in the pituitary. Reduced hormone levels correlate with lack of endocrine cell maturation, and ME neuroglia and oligodendrocy differentiation are also affected. Treatment with low-dose aspirin, known to affect neuroglia, rescues proliferative defects and hypopuitar in SOX mutants. The study highlights a central role of neuroglia for ME function during postnatal development and sensitivity to extrinsic signals. NGglia in ME are mostly affected by SOX loss, their proliferation corrected by lowose aspir or gut microbiota changes. Sufficient NGia are required in ME to support pituit celluration as animal becomes weaning. The study reveals a novel role for NGia in post-we formation of functional ME and control pituration, and robust phenotype due to SO loss can be modified by non-gen factors.
Researchers investigated the role of the protein F-act in C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis and identified GTPase CED-10/Rac as an essential activator of F-act. However, they needed to identify the GEF that activates C-10/Rac during embryonic cell migrations. The two-component GEF, CED-5/C-12, is known to activate C-10ac to promote cell movements resulting in corpse engulfment during embryogenesis and later migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell. They tested if C-5/C-12 was involved in embryonic migrations and got a contradictory result: C-5/C12 supported embryonic migrations, but inhibited F-act in the epidermis, opposite of what was expected for C10 GEF. To address this, they investigated if C-12 harbors GAP functions. A candidate region in- faces away the- G catalytic region. Mutating candidate Arg in the GAP region (R537) altered epider cell function, not corpsement. Interfered G function by with- ability to bind Rac/C-10. Mutating Ser-Arg in predicted bind and stabilize for catalysis resulted in loss of ventral and corpse. Genetic studies support GAP acts on Gases. They propose-5/C-12 support cycling multiple Gases by distinct to promote and inhibit-act nucleation.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the rodent visual system using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis. They found that information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increased along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. In contrast, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, but predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic recurrent network model with correlated input reproduced these observations, suggesting the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms for longer integration in higher areas while reducing predictability for efficient coding. 

The study used predict and timescales to probe hierarchical processing in mouse cortex, finding a gradual increase in times following the anatomical hierarchy had more predictive power for correlation and timescales. This suggests a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in visual cortex. An alternative hypothesis is that recurrence enables longer integration of information, thought to cause long times in primates. However, feedforward processing predicts higher times and hierarchy under stimulation with natural movies compared to spontaneous activity. Modeling suggests decrease in predict can be caused by increase recurrent, as stronger coupling reduces temporal correlations from stimuli. Decrease in predict may also reflect efficient coding, where processing removes redundancy in spike trains.
Researchers used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of the motor cortex's response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive treatment for neuropsych disorders. The study aimed to understand the neural circuits engaged during TMS, which are still poorly understood. Corticospinal waves, recorded from the corticospinal tract, provide a direct readout of the motor cortex's response to T, offering an opportunity to model neural dynamics. Sensitivity analysis identified pathways and machine learning was used to identify common features among these pathways, revealing neuron types that preferentially contributed to corticosp waves. The shortest conduction delay to layer 5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons determined the latency of cortic wave. Multiple neuron activations modulated specific cortic waves, supporting the hypothesis that different pathways contribute to cortic waves with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to the motor cortex and specific neurons initiated I-waves. The study provides a workflow for computationally tractable sensitivity analysis on complex models relating network structure to mechanisms underlying response to acute stimulation.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfDNA) is present in the maternal circulation throughout gestation and has significant potential as a research and clinical tool for investigating the placental epigenome across gestation, previously requiring invasive placental sampling. Since its discovery in 1997, cfDNA has been used in clinical non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the basic biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, limiting research and clinical utility. This review examines current knowledge of cfDNA, including origins and characteristics, highlighting gaps in knowledge and future directions. cfDNA is shed into maternal circulation throughout pregnancy, detected as early as week 4 gestation, comprising approximately 40% of total plasma-free DNA. cf has been used in NIPT to screen for genetic aberrations, notably chromosomal aneupies. Directing attention to cfDNA will improve understanding placental processes generating cf, cf role in pregnancy, and leveraging cf to monitor placental health and disease. Fetal and placental genomes are generally identical, but placental mosa can occur, highlighting distinction between cf"etal" and cfplac"DNA, especially in clinical applications. cfDNA represents full placental genome, non-invasive genome characterization. NI has been implemented to screen common aneupies, including Trisomies 13, 18, 21, assessing overrepresentation in plasma cfDNA.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the shared genetic risk factors among hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers. They found that risk variants for these cancers cluster in specific regions of the genome, contrasting with genetically unrelated traits. The study identified 44 multi-DC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping regions with risk for at least two HDCs, with two regions containing risk for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDC, and 28 for two HDC. Integrating genome-wide association data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter Hi-C maps from diverse cell models, they annotated 53 candidate genes at multi-DC risk regions. These genes were enriched with established cancer targets from the COSMIC Gene Census, but had previously unreported pleiotropic roles. Additionally, they pinpointed long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as potential HDC targets and identified risk in regions that altered transcription motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known targets were overrepresented among candidate multi-DC genes, implying some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or repurposing existing treatments for HDC. The study provides a framework for identifying common genes driving complex traits and understanding HDC susceptibility.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic cause of polymyositis in the Kiker dog breed, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by muscle inflammation. The study involved 33 cases and 106 controls, and identified a significant association with a region on chromosome 19. Haplotype analysis revealed a 2.9 Mb region shared by cases in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The deletion frequency was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random Kiker breed sample. Leukocytes from affected dogs homozy for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL upon mitogen stimulation. The study suggests elements 10-49 upstream of IL/IL play a role in regulation, and deletion is a risk factor for polymositis in Kiker. Estimated penetrance was 10-20 for homozygous and 0.5-2 for heterozygous dogs. The results indicate variants may be found at least 10 kb upstream of IL. The study demonstrates involvement of the ILIL locus in polymositis, but the responsible element and function in inflammatory processes are unknown.
Researchers have developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 protein domains. The model can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations, and performs reasonably well on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distant from the training set. Training on an ensemble of protein domains instead of a single domain improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein model for stability prediction. However, the model lags behind state-of-the-art in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths observed in nature. The researchers fine-tuned ESM-2 on the folding of small protein domains, which generalizes successfully to domains distal from the training, showing the potential of transfer learning to reduce experimental burden. ESMm performs comparably to state-of-art models and generalizes to small sequences distant from the training set. The model is limited to sequences longer than 72 residues in length, so it was benchmarked on stability datasets of larger proteins and compared to state-of-art methodologies.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIR) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1). They hypothesized that in autoimmunity, where an enhanced T-cell response is detrimental, iIR would have an opposite effect compared to their role in chronic infections. The study found that iIR genes, in the presence of their ligands, have a significant and consistent effect on HLA class II genetic associations in a case-control T1 dataset (N=11,961). This effect was validated in an independent dataset. The results suggest that iIR decrease HLA class II protective associations, indicating iIR regulate CD4 T responses in T1. iIR are a family of inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) and late differentiated T cells, with HLA I molecules as ligands. The impact of functional iIR on H associations has not been studied. The researchers postulated that given their impact on adaptive responses in chronic infections, iIR might play an analogous role in autoimm. Associations between H class II genes and T1 are clear that CD4 T play a role in T. They hypothesized if iIR modulate CD4 cell, this should manifest as iIR modulation H II genetic.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is an age-related cause of vision loss and the most common expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of FE cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CT repeat (CT18.1) within the ubiquously expressed factor encoding gene T4. The nonoding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. This study comprehensively describes CT18.1-driven molecular components in primary-derived coral endothelial cells from a cohort of individuals with CT18-expanded and CT-independent FE. Long-read, short, and transcript techniques interrogate expansion-specific biomarkers. Analysis reveals altered splicing within FE and transcripts associated with CT18-expans. Differential expression highlights transcript consequences within FE cells. Exon usage, pathway, and spatial reveal T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential consequences. Exome data from 134 FE cases identified rare and potentially deleterious T4 variants, suggesting T4 independent of CT18 may increase FE risk. This study supports two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation, underlying FE pathophysiology.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice (Oryza sativa) to improve direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) qLT11 from variety Arroz da, which shows rapid germination at lower temperatures using QTL-seq. The candidate region was delineated to a 52-kb interval containing the REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during seed germination. Arroz da GFh encodes functional GFh, whereas Japanese variety Hitb has a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Ar da allele decreased LT, while overexpressing GFh in Hitb increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal gene behind qLT. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functional GFh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. A NIL in Hitb background with 172b genomic fragment from Ar da including GFh showed superior LT to Hitb with comparable agronomic traits. The GFh from Ar da represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers investigated the structure of hepatitis B virus (HBV) relaxed circular (rc) DNA and its conversion to covalently closed (cc) DNA. They introduced a mutation into the 3' terminal redundancy (TR) of HBV pregenomic (pg) RNA, altering the sequence of the 3' strand of the negative DNA, while keeping the 5' TR wild type. The production of HBV rc and ccDNA in mutant cells was comparable to wild-type levels. Next-generation sequencing analysis showed that the positive strand of rcDNA and both strands of ccDNA predominantly carried the wild-type 182 residue, indicating the 5 TR of the negative strand serves as a template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the positive strand, while the 3 TR forms a flap structure, which is removed during cc formation. A survey of cellular endonucleases revealed that Mus81 plays a role in cc formation in wild-type HB replicating cells, alongside 5' endonuclease F1. Mus and F1 cleavage sites were mapped within the TR of rcDNA by RACE sequencing. The function between Mus and F1 in cc formation indicates the putative 5 and 3 flaps are dynamically interchangeable on rc precursors. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA and cc mechanisms, contributing to understanding the HB replication cycle.
Researchers developed a microbe-micro interaction genome-scale model (mmEM) to study the adaptation of microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a cannedine factory. The model encompassed three microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). Simulations revealed a shift from SO-domin to METomin community as organic rates increased, along with a decline in FC performance. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low rates and adaptation to high rates. The simulations showed SO growth under high due to reduced-sulfide cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating dominance. Cross-feeding dynamics under varying rates enabled scenario-based simulations to explore acidity impact on SO growth and FC performance. This highlights the role of crossfeeding in shaping community response to high rates. Insights will inform strategies for implementing FC in industrial environments.
Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to guide biological discovery in medicine, such as prioritizing promising molecules for drug discovery. In these applications, ML models predict properties of biological systems and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates for experimental validation. However, when applied to new situations, these models can be overconfident and produce many false positives. To address this, a solution is to quantify model uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) specified by researchers. A proposed is C, an ML framework for DR-controlled discovery. It integrates a deep model with a statistical tool as conform prediction, providing accurate DR-controlled predictions for a protein. Conform prediction provides guarantees the model and ensures the DR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Experiments show C achieves reliable DR, comparable performance at lower DR than existing methods and accurate for underrepresented in data. C is expected to be a tool for discovery where high validation is desired but budget is limited.
Researchers have identified hyperphosphorylated T-43 as a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in most patients. Mutations in the TARDB gene, which codes for T-43, can cause familial ALS, indicating T-43 dysfunction drives disease. Aggregated, phosphorylated T-43 may contribute to disease or be a cellular response to sequest toxic protein. The heat shock chaper H90 interacts with T-43 and stabilizes its conformation, but its role in neurotoxicity in vivo is unknown. Using a C. elegans model of ALS T-43opathy, loss of H90 protects against T- neuroxicity and neurodegeneration, accompanied by decrease in total and phosphorylated T-43. H90 also upregulates stress responsive heat pathway genes, including H70 and H16.1, and normal H16.1 levels are required for H90 effects on T43. The neuroprotective effect does not involve regulation of proteome activity in C. elegans. This study demonstrates H90 chaper activity contributes to outcomes in T- proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.
Researchers have created a comprehensive atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system using single-nucle RNA and AT sequencing, shedding light on the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and cellular identity in this species. The study aimed to address the limited understanding of these processes in arthropods due to the focus on model systems like Drosophila and Daphnia, which do not reflect the diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex systems. The atlas identified major cell types in the Artemia ovary, including germ, follicle, and muscle cells, and explored gene regulation of the chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and the presence of meiotic sex silencing in this group. 

 Single-nucle RNA sequencing resolved the complexity of the Artemia ovary, identifying clusters with distinct expression patterns sharing homology with Dophila ovarian clusters from the Fly Atlas, suggesting conserved expression programs for cellular identity and function. Clusters were mapped to Doph ovary from Fly Atlas using SAM, supporting high conservation of molecular pathways defining identity in the ovary. 

To explore cellular heterogeneity and regulatory chromatin accessibility, 10x single nucleus sequencing was performed on ovaries from mated and unmated females, and 10x AT+Gene experiments on ovar from unmated females. The study of meiotic sex regulation in a heterogamic system is a step in this direction, and highlights singleucle sequencing as an alternative to traditional approaches for studying meiotic regulation in species difficult to isolate meiotic cells.
Chronic pain is a widespread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage, costing the United States around $600 billion in 2010. A common symptom of chronic pain is allodynia, where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The mechanisms are unclear, but allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This study analyzes biophys-motically motivated subcircuits that represent motifs in neural in laminae-II of the horn, hypothesized to be part of pathways mediating two types of allody: static and dynamic. Neural rate models describe activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. Sensitivity analysis identifies mechanisms likely to cause allody-producing dysreg of subcirc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation inhibitory signaling or upregulation excitatory responses. Which mechanism, subcirc components involved, and proportion subcirc exhibiting vary depending on substructure. Results suggest diverse mechanisms may be responsible for allody, offering predictions for interindividual variability and targets for experimental studies.

The study identifies multiple excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in dorsal circuits, suggesting dysreg may occur through mechanisms dependent on injury or insult. Modeling interactions among interuron populations for E balance in healthy and disruption allody is a step. Painful stimuli activate excitatory cells and downstream neurons, gated by inhib populations under healthy conditions. Allody occurs when E balance disrupted, non-pain input causes excitatory firing, activating downstream neurons. Treatment of chronic pain requires understanding underlying causes. Dysregulation E in dorsal circuit is supported by preclinical studies, but understanding circuit and evidence leave questions how dysreg occurs.

Subcircuits reflect experimental structure mediating allody (evoked by von device) and dynamicody (Fig 1). Including spiking in rate network allows analysis interactions with structure maintaining or disrupting E balance. Studies show static and dynamic allody mediated afferent inputs.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in the function of eukary elongation factor 2 (EF2), a crucial for protein translation and ribosome translocation. They found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF2, with some mutations in Hsp or cochones reducing EF levels and growth, while others affecting sensitivity to diphther toxin, a post-translational modification of EF2. The study suggests H90 contributes to proteostasis not only by protein folding but also by enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. Hsp mutants were linked to subsets of cochones, indicating distinct versions of the H90 pathway for different clients. The interaction of H1, a protein, bridges EF with C1 and Hsp or TRC, was identified, and further studies are needed to understand this interaction. EF folding was measured by steady-state levels and susceptibility to dther toxin, showing H and cochones have distinct roles in mediating EF function. One goal is to understand how clients interact with H and cochones for selective inhibition of H90. Two isoforms of yeast Hsp, H82 and H82, are 97% identical, and EF, encoded by E1 and E2, have 100% identical isoforms.
Researchers investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, regions involved in decision-making, made choices in a gambling task with and after observing others' choices. Participants in both groups showed disrupted use of utility-based computations for risky options, but for socially situated decisions, they increased conformity with others' choices, independent of utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may serve as a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted. The study aimed to understand how decisions are made when preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, as in individuals with certain psychopathologies or novel options. Previous research focused on how social information contributes to choices with respect to individuals' preferences about risk. The study used a decision task to examine whether heuristics facilitate situated decision-making about risk when utility is disrupted. Individuals with insula or dACC lesions exhibited disrupted utility-based risk processing and used social information from others to guide decisions. Findings suggest conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based information in socially situated decision-making when individuals' risk processing is impaired. A parametric relationship was found between degree of impairment and use of 'others' choices heuristic, with those most disrupted in utility-based decision conforming most with others. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample, providing convergent evidence for a trade-off between utility processes and cognitively demanding heuristics facilitating risky options in social context.
Researchers have applied Richard Dawkins' iconic model of morphological evolution, known as biomorphs, to demonstrate how developmental bias influences evolutionary outcomes. They found that biomorphs exhibit phenotypic bias, where certain phenotypes are significantly more likely to appear through random mutations, and show a preference for simpler phenotypes with lower description complexity. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle, similar to evolution searching in a space of algorithms. Using population simulations, they showed that adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorphs that are less frequent. These patterns resemble findings in molecular-genotype maps, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained genome sections of the genome explains these patterns. The study suggests that bias towards simplicity and other biomorph patterns may hold in developmental systems beyond molecular.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems by having participants interact with a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick. The study consisted of three experiments where participants hit targets aligned with or offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. Results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize the pendulum's motion close to the N, even when targets were not aligned with it. For increased accuracy, participants adjusted arm stiffness to align resonant motions with the task. This study extends existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems, demonstrating capabilities to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions, possibly through muscle stiffness changes. A numerical tool was used to compute nonlinear modes (N) of the energy-conservative systems, allowing comparison with human motions. The pendulum was excited in various ways, not automatically falling to its N, and participants stabilized on a trajectory close to it by exploiting intrinsic dynamics. The study supports human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, intuitively exciting and stabilizing motions close to N. Participants used strategies to drive rhythmic motions, such as adjusting stiffness to align resonant motions with the task.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in responding to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude. The transition from exponential to stationary phase is controlled by a group of transcription factors called transition regulators (TSRs), which influence developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. However, the extent of TSR influence on bacterial physiology is not fully understood. This study demonstrates that two TSRs, Sco and Abr, along with Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate iron chelator pulerrin production in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis shows that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence rate and amount produced. Expression of pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is under control of Sco, Abr, and PR, and correlated with pulerr produced. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. Regulation by two distinct systems underscores the importance of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology.

Biochemical analysis shows regulators of pul biosynthesis operon and TSRs Sco and Abr bind yC promoter with differing affinities. Results indicate pulerr regulation in B. subtilis is under tight repression during exponential by two regulatory systems. TSRs Sco and Abr have been studied for diverse aspects of B. subtilis physiology. Absence modifies sporulation, competence, protease production, biofilm among other phenotypes. Microarray analysis of effect of Sco on global expression was carried out cells sampled points growth complex media.

Further roles of PR and Abr in regulation were established utilizing DNA assays and evidence Sco can bind yC in vitro. Results establish model where biosynthesis is regulated nutrient levels transition to stationary in addition input PR linking phase extracellular sequestration. However, results suggest PR and Abr act roadblocks RNAP at y promoter. Role Sco involves direct and may indirect through factor modulates. Presence three repressors necessary limit production mechanistic insight network production.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how spinal cord injuries (SCI) affect bladder function and how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve it. The model replicates the loss of neural control between the detrusor muscle, bladder, urethral sphincter, and pelvic muscles after SCI, leading to detrusor-sphinct dyssyria or incontinence. It also shows how TMS can restore coordination between these muscles. The model, based on the Hodgkin-Hux equations, normal bladder function, then adds interneurons and complexity to mimic dysfunction after SCI, and simulates the re-emergence of a voiding reflex. Low-frequency TMS (1Hz) normalizes voiding after SCI, while high-frequency T (30Hz) enhances urine storage. The model requires increased interactions among lumbar interneurons to replicate effects of SCI and T on mictition. The study provides a framework for analyzing neural circuits controlling mictition after SCI and the effects of T on the spinal cord as a therapeutic intervention for bladder dysfunction.
Researchers have proposed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from optical density (OD) data, a common in microbiology laboratory measurement, for Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus. The model accounts for OD being an indirect measure of growth by relating it to true fungal concentration, eliminating the need for calibration data generation. The model outperformed reference models in fitting and predicting OD growth curves, resolving discrepancies between morphology-specific rates from OD versus directly measured data in uncalibrated models. 

The model treats OD as a variable distributed around a linear transform of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. It was evaluated using time-course OD data for A. fumatus and estimated morphology growth rates from directly measured data. This study provides a method to infer biologically interpretable, morphology-specific growth from OD data without calibration, accessible to all microbiology labs collecting OD data, rather than specialists.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes, with most having XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination mechanisms also present in some groups. Researchers generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and utilized eleven beetle genomes to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. They identified ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share conserved genes across beet. The ancestral X chromosome is conserved across beet, but independent autosomes are added to the ancestral chromosomes. Neo-sex chromosomes evolve stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and non-random gene distribution with sex-based expression. Beet provide a novel model to understand diverse forces driving chromosome evolution.

A phylogenetic sampling of beet suggests they are a promising model to study kary evolution and evolutionary forces on chromosomes. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing kary evolution study at molecular level. The X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple neo-chromosomes formed among closely related species. Comparative analysis addresses prevalence and driving forces across species. Genomic approaches reconstruct kary evolution across Cole. A chromosome assembly was generated for Tribium confus and published assemblies from eleven species spanning phylogeny to reconstruct sex and kary evolution beet.
Researchers investigated the role of histone variant H2A Z in gene regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H2 Z is encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene and is evolutionarily conserved, predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-complex SW1. While H Z has been implicated in transcription regulation, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, growth defects of ht mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW1 subunits, suggesting previous work may be confounded by deleterious activity of SW1 when missing H Z substrate apoSW1. H mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions, suggesting a role in gene regulation may be uncovered after exposure to stress. To explore this, mRNA profiles were generated for wild, ht, sw, and htsw mutants before and after hydroxyurea H, which induces replication stress. Data showed Z played a prominent role in activation during H exposure and was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. ApoSW contributed to defects in ht, particularly genes involved in phosphate homeostasis. Mapping Z incorporation before and after H revealed decreases at transcription sites correlated with upregulation during exposure. This study characterized the effects of Z incorporation during transcriptional response H.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology, but classifying transcriptomic profiles from scRNA experiments into cell types and identifying individual cell lineages is challenging due to the accumulation of datasets and high dimensionality of data. To overcome this, automated methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised training, but obtaining annotated single-cell data is difficult, so a partial learning framework is proposed, assuming a set of candidate labels for each data point, a simpler setting than fully supervised. State-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble, are extended to partial learning, and the effect of label structure is studied, focusing on hierarchical labels in developmental processes. Simulated and real datasets show these enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly with a prototype method. Performances with partially annotated data reach fully supervised. Uncertainty in partially annotated data is studied, deriving prescriptive results on effect on accuracy. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying on less stringent annotated data than fully learning.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets, and its involvement in RNA polymerase II transcription. They found that PIP localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA and identified proteins that associate with PIP in a higher RNA-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, they unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP-associated (RD) proteome in human cells and found that intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with basic PIP-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. These IDRs also exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The study showed that Bromodomain protein 4 (BRD4) associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions and altered P2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BR4. The researchers propose that P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins, affecting their ability to form foci via phase separation, suggesting a pivotal role in establishing a functional nuclear architecture for gene expression.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, specifically the Scarabinae clade, known for their diversified development of novel secondary sexual traits such as horns. They generated chromosome-level genome assemblies of three Onthagini tribe species and compared them to seven other Coleoptera species, identifying coding sequence changes associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. Chromatin accessibility in developing horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition males and females revealed distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition-responsive development, including recently evolved elements sensitive to horn determination. Binding of known and new transcription factors were enriched in nutrition-open chromatin regions. The study highlights chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating gene networks highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides reference genomes for three species bolstering future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies.

Comparative genomics identified coding and non-coding changes in dung beetles associated with metabol and developmental regulation potentially underpinning evolution of nutrition plastic phenotypes. Biological pathways in lipid, carbohydrate, hormone, and transcriptional regulation are motivating hypotheses for nutrition-responsive development in this group. An in-depth genomic and developmental analysis of horns, secondary weapons with extreme variation, revealed non-synonymous substitutions in regulatory genes, some playing adaptive roles in species development. Beetle horns lack homology and are hotspots for diversification due to morphological variation within and across species.
Researchers used a cynomolg monkey model to study the pathogenesis of Lassa fever, a disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), to understand why some infections lead to severe illness and death while others do not. Histological and transcriptomic studies were conducted to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and immune response in relation to disease outcome. Lymphoid organs were found to be an early reservoir for LASV replication in all infected animals, regardless of disease severity. However, viral tropism varied with disease severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid organs and immune cells in non-fatal Lassa fever, but systemic dissemination to all organs and cell types leading to inflammation in fatal outcome. This study provides insight into early viral dynamics and host response to LAS infection according to disease outcome. A cynolg monkey model was used to replicate fatal and non-fatal Lassa fever, showing lymphoid organs as crucial for LAS replication in all animals. Tropism, dissemination, and immune infiltration differed between disease outcomes. Two LASV strains, Josiah and AV, were used to infect animals at same dose and route, resulting in fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. Analysis of these strains shed light on Lassa pathogenesis and immune mechanisms. Animal models are crucial for understanding Lassa pathogenesis and controlling LASV leading to illness or death. LAS replication in lymphoid organs followed systemic dissemination in severe fever, while restricted to few organs in survivors.
Researchers have investigated the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) disruptions in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). They found that mislocalization of nuclear pore proteins, transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP are seen in both familial and sporadic forms of these diseases. However, the question of whether these alterations are a primary cause or consequence of disease is unclear. The study used novel mouse models of neurodegeneration (Nemf86 and NemRg) that recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases and found Import-β-specific nuclear block. They observed cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in pathogenesis of ALS/FT and AD/AD, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran. These findings are supported by pathological interaction between Importβ and mutantNem86 protein in cytoplasm accumulations. Identified transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogenerative disease. Pharmaceutical inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human neuronal non-neuronal cells induced proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in mouse models. Convergent results between mouse and human neuronal nonuronal biology provide mechanistic evidence that mislocalized and dysregulated events in multiple neurogener diseases may arise from primary defect Importβ import. This has implications for investigating sporadic forms neurogeneration from unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations Importβ function.
Researchers have explored the potential of bacteriophages in medical and biotechnological applications by studying their infection mechanisms. CRISPR-Cas systems enable site-specific phage mutagenesis, but phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagen efficiency. To overcome this, the study utilized the eukotic enzyme NgET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Casuc cleavage and enhancing mutagen efficiency. This approach enables precise targeting and seamless mutation, exemplified by deactivating specific AD-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Temporarily removing modifications also elucidated the effects on T4 phage infections without necessitating deletions. The study presents a strategy for investigating phage epigen functions and streamlining phages with cytosine DNA. Temporal modulation of the phage epigen is valuable for synthetic biology and research comprehending phage mechanisms through mutant generation.
The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with processes such as transcription and replication. Multiple mechanisms act in concert to ensure DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV or DNA-damaging agent 4-nitrooline, act as transcription and replicational roadblocks and represent a major threat to cell metabolism. When located on the transcribed strand of genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER), an incompletely understood ER-path. Using a genetic screen in yeast Saccharces cerevisiae, histone variant H2 was identified as an important for transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H, repair by TCER is severely impaired and polymerase II clearance reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. Thus, is needed for TCER and plays a role in the maintenance of genome upon irradiation. This finding highlights the significance of repair-optimized chromatin environment in genomic stability. The histone variant is required for efficient TC and polymer II clearance following irradiation. Importantly, UVirradiation-depleted cells leads to accumulation of double-strand breaks, a threat to genome.
Researchers analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpian tub as well as microbiome in the gut of two Drosoph melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from divergent populations: one from the European range and one from the African range. They found extensive tissue and genetic-specific effects, with tissue-specific effects stronger than genetic-specific, and the gut more similar to each other than Malian tubules. Examination of allele expression revealed cis and trans effects more tissue-specific in differentially expressed between populations than conserved, with trans effects more-specific than cis. Despite variable architecture, this was robust across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting trans variation can be fine-tuned as well as cis during divergence. Transcript data from parental and F hybrid strains showed genetic and mode of variation highly tissue and background-specific. Gene expression was similar between Malian tub and midut, despite being part of excret and digestive system, while gut part alimentary canal. Findings demonstrate functionally interconnected tissues can show divergent architecture among and backgrounds. Overall, results yield insight into regulatory evolution, effects on tissue specificity, genetic on expression and microbiome, and importance of contextuality in studies.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection using a population dynamics approach based on early reported cases, rather than genomic data. They validated their model using simulated data and applied it to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in 2019. The model estimated the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wu at November 28, 2019 with a 95% confidence interval of November 2-December 9, 201. This falls within previously estimated ranges based on genomic data. The approach is generic and can be applied to other outbreaks. The model estimates the time between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case as 52 days with a 95% interval of 41-78 days. The emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK was estimated at August 21, 202 with a 95% interval of July 23-September 202. The method quantifies the proportion of the epidemic that remains undetected.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to study the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis, a process essential for sexual reproduction. The model simulates chromosome movements and interactions, including attractive and repulsive forces, to understand how homolog pairing occurs in the presence of non-hologous chromosomes. Key factors influencing pairing are chromosome number, size, movement, and repulsive forces. The model demonstrates that repulsive forces are effective when chromosome numbers exceed a certain threshold, reducing available space and allowing attractive forces to act when homologs are close. A repulsive force that dissociates nonolog chromosomes is crucial, representing molecular processes that break nonolog interactions. The model allows analysis of individual chromosome trajectories throughout meiotic prophase, facilitating comparison with experimental data. Modifying parameters, such as chromosome number, size, movement, and forces, provides insights into their contributions to homolog pairing. The model suggests pairing is achieved by two distinct, yet coinciding processes: nonolog confinement due to dissociation with nonolog via repulsive force, and confinement enabling attractive forces between homolog.
Li-Fumi syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations. MicroRNA miR-34 is a p53 target and modifier gene. In miR-34-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no cancer development, but lack miR promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. mi-34 genes are conserved and syntenic between zebraf and humans. Zraf mi-34 and mi-34/c have similar expression in development, but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage camptecin leads to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants are viable and have normal damage-induced apoptosis. Nevertheless, mi-34- compound with gain-function tp53R217/217 or tp- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp mutants alone, confirming tumor-suppressive of mi-34. Transcript comparisons at 28 hours post-fertilization (h) characterize damage-induced, and 28 and 72h determine mi-34-regulated. At 72h, loss mi-34 enhances erythrocyte levels and upregulates my-positive hematietic stem. Overexpression mi-34 suppresses reporter, not p53 induction and sensitizes embryos to camptec but not γ-irradiation.

In zraf, mi-34 and mi-34/c are primarily p53-dependent under DNA conditions and partially p for baseline expression. Residual mi-34 induction is due to other factors activated by damage. Direct evidence of mi-34 tumor functions is provided by earlier onset in mi-34 and tp mutants compared to tp. Transient overexpression mi-34 induces sensitivity to zraf embryos camptec (C) but not γir. C is DNA-inducing topoisomerase inhibitor which activates zraf. Despite mi-34 not affecting p53 genes, evaluated mi- effects in tp mutant zraf given epigen silencing M34 in humans TP mutant contributes cancer. Used tp- and tpR217/217 as control and generated homozygous mi-34- tp- and mi- tpR217/217 compound lines. Expression mi-34 is partially on p under conditions and by damage is fully p. Moreover, mi34 has small transcript effects 28h zraf embryos under control and damage.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator OL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of OL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). In hermaphrodites, OL-1 is highly expressed, while in males OL-1 is expressed at low levels. OL-1 is known to be critical for proper male development, but its low expression was considered minimal in hermrodite development. This study reveals OL- plays a role in regulating developmental timing in hermrodogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, hermrod embryos have accelerated cell division and developmentally advanced transcription when OL-1 is lost. Further analysis shows OL- regulates initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and sex-based transcription in hermrodites. OL- mutant embryos overexpress H3K methyltransferase MET-2 with altered H3Kme landscape, effects reversed by MET- loss. This demonstrates OL plays a developmental role in embryos of both sexes and MET acts as OL effector in hermrod.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurv (Mosquito Gene Surveillance) to optimize the placement of mosquito traps for genetic surveillance in the field. This is particularly relevant for gene drive projects that aim to control mosquito populations, which require monitoring for unintended spread and emergence of resistant alleles. MGSurv takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and their habitats, such as food sources, breeding sites, movement, and trap attractiveness. It minimizes the time to detect an allele of interest, ideally before remediation is no longer viable. The framework was applied to Anopheles gambia on the island of São Tomé, Tom and Princ, and Aedes aegypt in Queensland, Australia, demonstrating optimal trap placement. MGS is a resource for field and computational researchers in mosquito surveillance. The study highlights the importance of early detection, as seen in invasive species studies, to minimize impact, preserve elimination, and cost-effectiveness.
Researchers studied the microorganism Symbonas scillans, a 1.4 μm heterotrophic eukaryote, to investigate the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. They generated amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing data from two strains, RCC257 and RCC24, but found no sequences from known endosymbiotic lineages. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis also confirmed the absence of endobacteria. Instead, numerous contigs from both strains were related to prasiniruses infecting green algae Ostreoccus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Micromonas pus. Using the Bp genome as reference, they assembled a near-complete 190bp draft genome encoding hallmark prirus genes and two incomplete assemblies from RCC257 and three from RCC. A multi-gene tree showed three SV types branching with Bp, OlVs, and MpVs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190nm virus-like particle similar to the endosion reported in Sscillans. The study concludes Sill does not harbor endosymb bacterium but is associated with viruses.
Researchers have identified the leiomodin (L) family of actin-binding proteins as crucial for muscle function, with mutations in three family members (L1, 2, and 3) leading to human myopathies. Mutations in the predominant cardiac isoform, L2, result in severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the L gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no L protein is expressed. This study shows that nonsense-mediated decay, a cellular mechanism eliminating mRNAs with premature codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two L2 disease-causing mutations. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides were generated to obstruct the exon complex, preventing nonsense-mediated decay of L2 transcripts, restoring mutant expression. This lays groundwork for therapeutic intervention in L-linked myopathies.

Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in L3, the isoform in skeletal, result in nemal myopathy, a muscle disorder by weakness. Disease mutations have been found in cardiac-predant iso, L2. The first case of mutation L2 (W*) results in severe neon dilated cardiopathy. In the patient with described disease-causing L2 (W*), L2 was not detected via western blot and RT-qPCR revealed decrease in L2 levels, but no preRNA. Thus, nonsense-mediated decay (N) underlies loss mutant expression. Two L2 disease-causing mutations (R* and LV*) lead to lack of L expression through N. Developed steric oligonucleotides to inhibit N of L, increasing mutant-truncated.
Researchers investigated how different forms of the apolipoprotein E (Apo) gene, specifically Apo2, Ap3, and Ap4, affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Apo4 is known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's, while Ap2 is moderately protective. The study used transgenic mice expressing human Apo genes to measure changes in protein homeostasis, the regulation of protein concentration and quality. In the brain, Ap4 and Ap2 altered regulation of mitochondrial proteins compared to wild-type Ap3. Ap4 lacked cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autophagy, reducing protein quality. Ap2 increased degradation of mitochondrial and membrane proteins, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, suggesting coordinated replacement of the organelle. In the liver, no changes were observed, indicating the Apo effect on proteasis is amplified in the brain. The study combined protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM) toolkit to knock out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in Drosophila, a powerful model organism for studying neuromuscular junction (NM) biology. This approach, called CRPR-TRM, allows for efficient tissue-specific gene knockout and has been validated by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrating its use with the Gal/UAS expression system and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. The researchers used CR-TRM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NM maintenance and found that the ESCRT pathway suppresses NM bouton growth by downregulating retrograde signaling. They also found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NM. CRTRM has been used to reveal important genes for NM structural plasticity.
During the larval stages of Drosophila development, the lymph gland progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is essential for their differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase) and upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FA) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Our study found that the Drosila NF-κ transcription factor Rel shields the progenitor pool from metabolic pathway induction into differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, but its input is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not entirely exhausted.

Rel is expressed in the embryonic lymph gland, but its expression is restricted to the larval progenitor pool. Overexpressing Rel in progenitors leads to downregulation of FA. Negative regulation of NFκ signaling on fatty oxidation has been reported in various conditions. The progenitor population within the gland is intercepted from precocious differentiation. Developmentally, high ROS levels in blood cells elicit JNK to facilitate differentiation. The J-FA axis is essential for progenitor differentiation. Our study reveals Rel expresses in ROS-rich progenitors and wanes as cells move towards differentiation. Loss of Rel from progenitors leads to activation of JFA, coaxing differentiation. Rel expression wanes in edges, inhibition T1 is lost. Absence restrains T1 results in sustained J activation, impinging FA and progenitor differentiation.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene. However, a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNUAT, instead the homozygous RT c.295A variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. In this study, the impact of the variant on RT function was deciphered in RT-depleted R1 cells and patient fibroblasts, and neural stem cells (NS) derived from CRPR/C9-edited induced pluripotent cells revealed major cycle and mitotic abnormalities leading aneuplo, cycle arrest and cell death. Cortical organoids showed an additional function of RT in self-organisation of NS into neural roset, observing delayed ap-basal polarization NS. These defects contributed to marked roset formation delay in RT-mated organoids, impeding growth and shedding light on mechanisms to microcephaly.

The RT.295A variant, located at the penultimate nucleotide of exon 23, alters splicing site of intron 23. This was confirmed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, and RNA sequencing. The study investigated pathophys mechanisms of RT c.295A variant in a patient with Tay-Like syndrome in fibroblasts and iP-derived models. Patient fibrobl, engineered R1 cells, and CR9-ed pluripotent cells were differentiated into NS and corticaloids. Analysis of RT isoforms from mutated allele in patient and cellular studies centrome complex and functions were conducted. Results established RT c.295A consequences. RT-mated NS accumulated G-M phase due mitotic abnormalities leading aneup, arrest or apoptosis. Mitotic defects associated misorientation mit spindles favour premature NS neurons.
Researchers conducted a six-year-long experiment to study the dynamics of Escherichia coli's adaptation to a state of prolonged resource exhaustion, known as long-term stationary phase (LT). They used whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points to reveal novel aspects of adaptation. The study found that E. coli continuously adapts to resource exhaustion through convergent accumulation of mutations over six years, establishing long-lasting lineages with similar across populations. These lineages arise independently, showing high parallelism in adaptations under LT, enabling the identification of loci with significant mutation associations, suggestive of historical contingency. Associations are frequent, with a third of convergently mutated loci involved in at least one association. Results demonstrate LT adaptation characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency. 

The study discerned lineage structure of populations, showing convergent, with lineages defined by same RNAP mutations behaving similarly across populations. Convergent mutation was also observed in LTE, with populations accumulating similar mutations to loci. The experiment was initiated in 2015 to study E coli adaptation under prolonged resource exhaustion, consuming butyrate. Two aspects of dynamics under LT enabled identification of putative loci: convergence of adaptation and contingency. Convergence is a feature of many evolutionary experiments. E coli and non-sporulating bacteria survive periods exhaustion by entering LT.
Researchers have re-examined the role of the male-specific (MSA) transcript in Drosophila melanogaster, which was initially classified as a non-coding RNA, and found it codes for a microptide that regulates sperm usage in mated females. The MSA transcript shares a promoter with another transcript, iab-8nc, which is produced in both sexes in the central nervous system. However, while MSA produces a peptide, i-8 does not. The study found that the absence of i-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism involving unique 5' exons of i-nc. Through cell culture and transgenic analysis, they showed that this mechanism relies on upstream reading frames in these exons preventing protein production from downstream frames. The i-nc transcript is expressed in the central nervous system and its loss leads to male and female sterility due to loss of microRNA within its introns. A shorter version of this transcript, male-specific (MS), was found in male abdomen and codes for microptide MSi that mediates sperm usage in females. The study investigated regulation of translation in i- transcript using reporter constructs in culture and transgenic flies and found that upstream sequences in 5 exons prevent translation of i. The difference between MS and i- lies in first exons.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare, multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays. Due to the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms can affect most systems. Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and GPI synthesis, lead to CD. Loss-function mutations in 189 glycos genes cause CD. Current methods can only be applied to one disorder at a time. The CD are likely connected because they affect glycosylation and show similar symptoms in patients, suggesting common modifiers may affect multiple CD. This study leveraged evolutionary tools to analyze glycos genes and identify modifiers for all CD genes. Evolutionary covariation (ERC) between N-glycosylation and GPI synthesis suggests unexplored connections between pathways. ERC occurs when proteins are under evolutionary constraints. High ERC between GP1, a GPI transamase, and AL1, manosyltransfer in N-glycos (ERC 9.29) and seven glycos proteins in top-scoring pairs are associated with CD, suggesting known CD genes are candidates for modifiers. Top scores revealed ERC between PB and U20 (10.33) and P and W36 (9.74). Glycos is conserved from yeast to mammals, allowing strong signals to develop over time. Identified modifiers for CD have ERC, including PM2PM (7.08) and DPTDPM (4.17). In vivo testing top hits had a higher rate (10/16) than other ERC studies (5/16 and /34).
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein, HBc, has two distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and arginine-rich C-terminal (CTD) for pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBCTD, especially at Ser162 and 170, is essential for nucleation with polymerase (Pol) to initiate pg encapsation. As caps mature, HBCT undergoes deosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late encapsation stage, which remains to be determined. Using a-S170 antibody for non-phosphorylated HB-S170, a transition from phosphorylated to deosphory state was observed during pg packaging. Pol-dependent deory of HB-S170 was confirmed by substitution of single amino acid Val782 in RNase domain, abolishing deory of HB-S170. Immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and protein analyses showed recruitment of host phosphat PP dependent on Pol-Val domain. This recruitment does not require HB but via RNA signal, suggesting Pol-pRNA plays role in PP recruitment. Pol-pRNA-PP-mediated deory of HB-S170 is essential for pg encapsation completion and associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVs). HB may play dual role by bringing pg to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion of packaging. This elucidates mechanism of Pol-mediated deory of HB regulates pg encapsulation and reveals PP as potential antiviral target.
Researchers investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. They sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from genera Codia and Cten, collected on either side of the isthmus, to study how environmental conditions influenced the selection of symbts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucid sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazotropha symbts, with those from the Caribbean having genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Eastern Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of nifDK operon revealed the common ancestor lacked n genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats required the operon through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola symbt lineage. The study suggests HGT of n operon facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazro enducida clade, highlighting importance of nitrogen in ecological diversification of chemynthetic symbt species and bacterial role in adaptation to changing conditions.
Researchers have identified 9,291 TAS2 receptors from 661 vertebrate genomes, revealing that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high TASR content compared to other vertebrates. Phylogenomic analysis shows that TASRs are often found in clusters, with amphibians having more clusters and genes per cluster than other vertebrates. One-to-one orthologs are found between closely related species, but TASR count is stable in most lineages. TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extraoral tissues. In vitro assays, many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xeniotics. Bitter taste is associated with a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPC) called TASRs or T2, encoded by compact intronless genes. Vertebrates have a wide TASR repertoire varying across lineages, from zero in cetans to two in frogs. The varying levels suggest multiple mechanisms driving evolution of bitter receptor repertoire in vertebrates. Phylogen relationships and genomic location suggest recombination plays a role in creating TASR variation through copy and gene conversion. The number of expressed receptors not in tongue is proportional to TASRs in genome, suggesting increases allowed acquisition of tissue-specific functions.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in regulating transcription and its impact on intestinal stem cells. A protein complex containing Notch intracellular domain (NICD), RBP, and MAML binds to DNA as monomers or dimers to regulate transcription. Notch-deficient (NDD) alleles of Notch1 and Notch2 mice are sensitive to environmental insults but develop normally otherwise. Transcriptomic analysis of colon spheroids showed no dimer-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro, and an elevated epithelial immune response to symbionts, likely causing heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. 

Quantitative mass spectrometry in human carcinoma cells expressing NOT2 or NOT2 revealed an unbalanced interactome, reduced interaction of NOT2 with transcription machinery but preserved with HD2 interactome, suggesting modulation via cooperativity. The HD2 inhibitor Valpro acid (PA) prevented intestinal consequences of DD and secretase inhibitors in mice spheroids, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation in stem cells. 

Notch dimerization in mammals is less about transcriptional regulation and more about proteome environment with consequences to immunity and hypersensitivity of N mice. HD3 interacts with NIC, regulating stability and activity. Not activation expands stem niche at expense of goblet and entero cells. NDD mice show environmentally modulated susceptibility DSS and decrease colonic cells, but mechanism linking dimer with niche unknown. This study used NDD model to investigate N dimer in intestinal colonic cells.
Researchers have extended the theory of background selection to understand its effects on genetic diversity and differentiation in populations with migration. Background selection occurs when deleterious alleles reduce diversity at linked neutral sites, influencing total diversity (π) and genetic differentiation (F) in populations. The theory is split into two regimes: the background regime with strong selection and low mutation rates, and the interference regime with weak selection and high mutation rates. Previous work focused on deleterious alleles in the background regime, but evidence suggests migration reduces background effects on F. This study derives novel theory for subpopulations and extends the interference regime to an island model. Simulations show the theory predicts F and π. Background selection may increase F under high migration by reducing correlated fitness effects within subpopulations, but decrease π in metapopulations with large effective size. The work extends background theory to structured populations and suggests it minimally confounds locus-to-locus F scans. A quantitative model accounts for migration's effects in an island, showing it lessens cross-gener associations between neutral and deleter alleles. Non-trivial migration rates attenuate background effects on F and reduce π. Theoretical predictions support background weakly confounding locus-loc F when flow is common. Simulations suggest this in an island when m ≥. The study derives F in an island with selection and finite demes when migration follows genetic drift. The theoretical approach accounts for migration's influence on background in an island with diploid individuals.
Researchers emphasize the importance of increasing genetic and phenotypic data size for understanding disease determinants, but highlight methodological barriers to collaboration and data sharing among institutions due to sample heterogeneity and privacy concerns. To address this, they developed FedGAT, a federated genetic testing tool using federated statistical approach for association tests correcting confounding and polygenic effects without sharing data among sites. Using simulated and real datasets, FedAT achieves similar results to pooled analysis under privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements. Challenges in feder studies include designing harmonized data collection, covariates, and phenotypes, leading to meta-analyses sharing summary statistics with less computational burden and privacy concerns. Current research focuses on secure GWAS, adopting feder methods like χ2, PCA, and logistic regression, but lacks correcting confounding poly effects due to complexity. The proposed FedAT integrates random effects and study designs without algorithm changes, leveraging efficient GMM testing. A privacy-preserving feder GW algorithm, FedAT, uses homomorphic encryption and OTP to protect statistics aggregated in feder setting, increasing data sharing and protection.
Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-based incidence and mortality, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, their accuracy continues to improve, and research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness in African and Asian populations is key for equitable use. This study benchmarks the predictive power of six widely used PRS algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts, finding modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a simple method prioritizing variants, clumping, and polygenic scores. The study underscores the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts. 

Recent advances in genetics have led to improved cross-ancestry PR disease prediction, but these models have not been formally assessed in prostate cancer. The analysis across two biob-scale datasets benchmarks six algorithms, finding improvement over traditional clumping methods. These are based on variant prioritization, shrinkage, joint statistics, annotation, mapping, and population heritability estimates. This is the first study to assess panance polygenic prostate in the All Us cohort. Hierarchical clustering stratifies poly scores by ancestry. PR-stratified prostate antigen screening may reduce overdiagnosis and over-treatment associated with screening. Given ancestry-associated incidence and outcome biases, scores must work equally across populations to limit disparities. 

The study evaluates published polygenic scores in the UKob cohort, finding no differences in cancer or risk factors such as year, BMI, smoking, or alcohol. Public scores were evaluated in the dataset. Logistic models were trained on allelic scoring and first 10 genetic components, regardless of population. Predictive performance improved with integration of age and poly score. Similar UKob, addition history and BMI did not increase power. The study demonstrates utility of scores from the UKob dataset, genetic with age sufficient to predict cancer.
Researchers identified a congenital disorder of glycosylation, DPAG1CD, caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-glycosylation. They used a Drosophila model of DP1CD with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype to perform a drug repurposing screen on 1,520 FDA-approved small molecules. The screen identified 42 candidates that improved the DP1 model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DP1 model. Loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting dopamine flux and binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to glycosylation as a potential therapeutic target for DP1CD. The study also validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine, CO inhibitors, and NK1 inhibitors, revealing novel biology and potential therapeutics for DP1CD.
Researchers developed a computational model, called topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topoVA), to understand how the brain represents limb position and movement in the somatosensory cortex. The model was trained on natural human movement data and reproduced two key observations from monkey studies: the shape and velocity of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and the distribution of preferred directions (PD) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes predictions that encoding across the cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs and few neurons encode single joints. This model provides a basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and neural manifolds, with applications in brain-computer interfaces and humanoid control.

The study aimed to relate kinematics to proprioception by modeling and comparing to single-unit recordings from monkeys. A novel model was formulated that predicts neural coding and spatial organisation across cortex. The topoVA model was trained, validated, and tested on human arm kinematics, exploring emergent proprioceptive representations in its layer. The model's ability to reproduce features will help elucidate principles of brain proprioceptive representations. The assumption that proprio principles captured by topoVA based on human movement extend to monkeys was made.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene, a plant hormone involved in growth and stress responses, in plant-micro interactions from the plant perspective. However, few studies have examined its role in microbes. This study found that Azospirillum brasil, a plant-associated bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospillum Eth Response 1 (AE1), which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and root colonization. RNA sequencing and metabolomics showed ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters A brasil colonization density and metabolism, indicating the bacterium adapts upon sensing ethylene. This provides potential targets to regulate beneficial plant-micro interactions. Ethylene receptors have been well-stud in plants but not extensively in non-plant species. Azo1 binds ethylene and regulates A brasil physiology, reducing biofilm and root colonization, prompting an examination of eth role as a signal in this species and how perception affects traits including colonization. Phylogen analyses indicate putative eth receptors in bacterial phyla, including non-pathogenic proteobacteria associating plants, suggesting eth may be perceived to mediate interactions. Most studies focused on micro-induced eth levels or signaling in plants.
Researchers investigated the role of the IN80 protein, a catalytic subunit of the IN80 chromatin remodeling complex, in regulating gene silencing on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. Immunolocalization of IN80 at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggested its involvement in the meiotic body. Deletion of IN80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes and incomplete inactivation of RNA polymerase II on sex chromosomes. The study suggests IN80 facilitates recruitment of DNA repair factors for silencing sex genes. This role is independent of common IN80 target H2A. Instead, IN80 absence reduces chromatin accessibility at DNA sites on sex chromosomes, indicating a role in DNA factor localization and silencing sex genes during pachema. IN80 interacts and regulates sex gene silencing in pene spermatocytes, promoting chromatin opening during zyema-pachema transition at DSB regions. IN80 regulates chromosome accessibility during meiotic progression. Accessibility is crucial for DNA repair and transcription. IN80 also silences autosomal genes in spermatocytes by promoting H3me3 modification while H4 remains unaffected. However, IN80 silencing sex genes meiotic is independent of direct transcriptional regulation. IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB sex regions, independent of histone H2. IN80 interacts with factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment during pachema. IN80 also interacts with DNA factors A and M in meiotic spermatocytes. γ2 X at D sites zema remained intact in IN80KO spermatocytes.
Researchers investigated the role of SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasmin family, in axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. SV-1 has a dual function, acting as an HGF growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease to regulate development. The study aimed to understand how SV-1 is converted from a protease to growth factor for axon regeneration. Cytidine deaminase CDD-2 was found to play a role in the conversion of SV-1. A codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of SV-1 suppressed the c-2 defect in axon regeneration. The hairpin structure around His-755 in sv-1 mRNA was required for activation of ax regeneration by SV-1. Results suggest C-2 promotes regeneration by transforming SV-1 function from protease to growth through modification of sv-1 mRNA. The JNK signaling pathway regulates ax regeneration, including the sv-17/c-2 gene encoding cytidine deaminase C. C- is required for regeneration by converting SV-1 from protease to growth. SV-1 contains a Kringle domain, N-terminal related to plasmin activation, and serine protease, with a dual function as HGF growth and plmin-like prote. A mechanism must exist to convert SV-1 from prote to growth function in regeneration. C-2 is specific in axon regeneration after injury, as c-1(ok) mutants regenerated axons normally. C- functions in the JNK pathway, originally identified in RNA screen for sv genes.
Researchers used zebraf fish to investigate the possibility of controlling collective behavior by modifying the characteristics of its constituents at the individual level, rather than externally. They genetically modified the fish to lack the col11a gene, which causes early onset osteoarthritis, resulting in compromised vertebral properties, bent bodies, and slower swimming. Surprisingly, a group of mutant fish exhibited more orderly motion than wildtype. A simple active matter model captured the collective behavior of both types, with mutant fish modeled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing its state with a simple model. 

The study used the zebraf system, with well-established collective behavior monitored by tracking individual fish and amenable to genetic modification. Collective behavior was compared to active matter models encapsulating fish properties, interactions, and environment interactions. The behavior of col2-/- zraf was investigated, with homozygous deleterious mutation in the cola gene. The genetic modification caused vertebral defects, less body bending, and slower reorientation. Spinal development and bending likely prevented mutants from frequent directional changes, longer orientational time. The col-raf exhibited less orientational noise, modeled as self-prop agents aligning. Group reduced noise captured by increased persistence.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the formation of capillary networks in vitro, a crucial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical cues to predict cell migration, morphology, deformation, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transport. The results show that capillary networks develop when mechanical and chemical signals work together, with morphology driven by soluble and bound forms of VEG. Soluble VEG induces morphological changes, while bound VEG on the biog surface provides orientational signals. The network relies on biog deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and VEG gradient for spatial cues. The model agrees with experiments, but has limitations, such as omitting bound VEG necessity and not fully reproducing biog results. A hybrid model by vaners et al. shows capillary development via stress and strain between cells and substrates. Another model by Vilanova et al uses cell-based CPM and PDE to predict endothelial migration and biog deformation.
Researchers investigated the role of Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) ligands in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans' immune response to bacterial pathogens. The study found that all five TGF ligands, including DB-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, T-2, and T-3, play a significant role in survival against bacterial infection. Notably, multiple TGF ligands act redundantly as part of this response, with two BMP-like ligands DB-1 and T-2 functioning independently, while T-2/BMP and TGF/Activin-like T-3 functioning together. Structural analysis suggests T-2 and T-3 can form heterodimers. Additionally, T-2 and T-3 lack a conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking dimers. The study also found that DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transducers function in response to pathogens, while components of DAF TGF/Activ signaling do not play a major role. This demonstrates potential for BMP and T/Activ subfamily ligands to interact, providing a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic functions from acute responses like the immune to pathogens.
This study investigates the role of the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat4) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat4 acetylates the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2, and is implicated in the response to DNA damage. Yeast cells lacking Nat4 exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more breaks than wild-type cells. Upon damage, Nat4 expression is elevated and the enzyme is recruited to double-strand breaks. Deeper into its effects on the damage cascade, Nat-deleted cells have lower levels of damage-induced H2ASph (H2) and diminished binding of checkpoint protein Rad9 surrounding double-strand. Consistently, Mec1 recruitment to double-str breaks, critical for H2ph deposition and Rad retention, is impaired in Nat cells. Consequently, Mec-dependent phosphorylation of effector Rad53, indicative of damage activation, is reduced. Importantly, the effects of Nat in the cascade are mediated by its-terminal acetylase activity towards histone H4. This study reveals a novel link between histone-terminal acetylase Nat and DDR, associating a hist-modifying activity in genome maintenance.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells within a tumor, known as a phylogeny, using DNA mutations from multiple samples. Current methods can only accurately reconstruct phylogenies with up to 30 mutations, but Orchard can handle up to 1000 mutations. It uses a novel approach called factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogen, where each factor corresponds to adding a new mutation to a built phyeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially to generate larger phylogenies, resulting in a complete tree containing all mutations. Evaluations show Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing plausible phylogen in 90 cancers and 14 B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias. It accurately reconstructs phylogen with up to 1000 mutations. Large phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations.
Researchers have developed Immugen, a modular language model for predicting immunogenicity of CD8+ epitopes, a crucial for personalized cancer treatment development. Immunogenicity prediction is challenging due to low reactivity rates in neoantigens and limited training datasets. Immugen consists of a pMHC module trained on three pHC tasks, an optional TCR module, and context-specific immunogenic prediction modules. Compared to state-of-the-art models, Immugen performs comparably on pHC affinity, eluted ligand, and stability tasks, and outperforms on pHC immunogenic prediction (AUC=0.619, precision=0.514) with a 7% increase in precision. Immugen's performance improves with TCR integration. The model is analyzed for interpretability, highlighting areas of weakness in existing models and biases in datasets. CD8 neoepitopes play a key role in personalized therapeutics, allowing targeted treatments. Immugen is a modular language model achieving state-the performance on pHC immunogenic prediction and integrating TCR inputs. The pHC module processes peptideHLA input with immunogenic classification fine-tuned with T-based inputs. Immugen provides a framework for immunogenic prediction using a protein model achieving state-the performance on CD+ reactivity data.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study and gene-based analysis on 230 fast-growing white-feather chickens to identify genes related to meat lightness and redness. They mapped a 6.24 QTL region (G15: 629.34-630.58 kb) and found that protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1) was associated with meat color (p=8.65E-08). Mendelian randomization analysis validated the causal relationship between PPP1 expression and lightness (p<2.9E-12). Skeletal muscle-specific PPP1 knockout mice showed increased lightness, decreased myoglobin, and shifted myofibers from slow-twitch to fastwitch. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed inhibition of PPP1 decreased slow-twitch myiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. A plasm reporter assay showed a SNP (rs520, C>T) in PPP intron regulated transcription. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, rs520 variant, and fastwitch marker were detected between fast-growing and local chickens. PPP1 was identified as the causative gene for color and a novel variant for meat improvement.
Researchers have developed a new technique called superresolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the functional architecture of the retina. This method combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to identify the subunits within a ganglion cell's receptive field, which are responsible for nonlinear signal transmission from bipolar cells. By inferring these subunits from ganglion cell activity, researchers can gain new insights into the retina's functional structure. The technique, STR, uses a center-surround structure to sharpen subunit responses and tomographic reconstruction to locate subunits across various variations. Simulations demonstrate its reliability and application in primate ganglion cells validates its feasibility. STR can reveal subunit layouts in a few minutes, making it suitable for online and closed-loop investigations of receptive field structure in retina.

The technique combines stimulated emission depletion microscopy and computed tomography principles, termed superresolved tomographic reconstruction. Researchers investigate STR's potential via electrophysiological recordings from primate ganglion cells. Rapid subunit identification leaves time for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry. Knowing sublocations, stimuli can be manufactured to characterize spatiotemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic weight of each sub, and evaluate similarity across sub within gang cell field. Interactions between bipolar cells can be studied.

To test the method, electrophys recordings were performed on isolated marmet retina using multielectrode while projecting stimuli onto retinal photoreceptors.
Researchers have developed a novel statistical method called CRPR-DR (Dose-Response) to identify genes that interact with antibiotics in chemical-genetic interactions (CGI) experiments. The method incorporates both the efficiency of small guide RNAs (sgRNAs) and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation to capture the non-linear interaction between them. In a CGI experiment with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, CRPRDR identified genes that interact with antibiotics. The approach can be applied to non-CGI datasets, as shown by analyzing a CRISPR dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. CRPRDR outperforms other methods in precision, maintaining fewer false positives in both empirical and simulated data. The method requires multiple sgRNAs for each target, varying in strength, and experimentally quantified efficiencies in control conditions as input. The primary use case is identifying chemical-genetic interactions with drug as a covariate. In CGI, sgRNA efficiency can be used to identify genes whose depletion synergizes with increasing drug concentration. The CRPR model extends previous work by accommodating drug and sgRNA effects in one model. Ideally, interacting genes exhibit synergistic behavior with drug, where target depletion induces excess or enrichment of mutants in presence of inhibitor, concentration-dependent.
Researchers investigated the structure of gene-expression networks in Drosophila melanogaster using RNA-seq data from an outbred population. They employed a community detection method, the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM), which does not assume genes are organized in assortative modules. Instead, SBM separates genes into hierarchically organized blocks using all information in the co-expression network. Results showed that SBM found ten times more groups than competing methods, and several groups were not modular. Functional enrichment of non-modular groups was as strong as modular communities. This suggests the transcriptome is structured more complex than thought, and modularity is not the main driver of gene-expression structuring. The study did not explore network estimation before community detection, using weighted networks for WGC and sparser for SBM. Non-modular blocks were widespread, with strong functional relevance, highlighting the need to incorporate beyond assortativity when exploring networks. Methods like graphical LASSO have been used, providing better estimates of gene-gene connections and weights. Combining SB with network inference is possible, using community structure to inform inference. To address alternative organizations, a similarity measure was used to find non-assortative groups with biological interpretation, implemented in SBM. Networks were trimmed to remove spurious edges, maintaining structure. Assumming communities are assortative, WGC was compared to SB, showing SB outperformed.
Researchers studied the role of cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) in yeast, which is involved in post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. They used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and RiboSeq to analyze the effects of deleting the PAB gene in yeast cells. The results showed drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. The defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in PAB cells appear to be partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components, in addition to P1's direct role. Cells lacking P1 manifested a nonsense codon readthrough, indicative of a defect in termination. The study indicates that P1 loss is pleiotropic and disruptive to post-transcription regulation.
Researchers investigated the generation of slow brain rhythms, such as those seen in slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures, and spreading depolarization, which are accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. These rhythms typically have a lower frequency than action potential firing and are thought to arise from network mechanisms involving synaptic interactions, delays, or intrinsic bursting neurons. The study proposes an alternative mechanism available to all neurons with class I excitability, based on the interplay of fast spiking dynamics with slow extracellular potassium concentration mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Bifurcation analysis of the system reveals a hysteres loop around a bistable region emerging from a saddle bifurcation common in class I excitable neurons. Depending on the Na+/K+-Pase strength, bursts are generated from pump-induced bifcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. The study suggests transitions between dynamics result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypox affecting Na+/P activity. A minimal model outlining the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics may contribute to understanding pathologies like epilepsy and inform therapeutic strategies.
Researchers have developed the COPS package to evaluate and compare multi-omics clustering methods for disease subtyping, focusing on stability and prognostic relevance. Current frameworks lack comparison between data-driven and pathway clustering, highlighting a methodological gap. COPS offers advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration, some of which are not accessible in R and new approaches proposed. The framework was applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and methylation data. Unlike previous studies, COPS contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival via Cox models including covariates, and stability. Survival and standard metrics vary across methods and datasets, necessitating multi-criteria evaluation. The Pareto concept was applied to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case. Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non-Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic development and specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. A novel loss-of-function sem-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain was identified, revealing new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM-2 antagonizes LET-381, the C elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage, and is essential for the proliferation and diversification of SM. SEM-2 also regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for patterning the lineage. This study adds to the understanding of the conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins and the regulatory network underlying C elegans postembry development. SEM-2 is essential for specifying SM fate in the ventral lineage, while SMA9 and LET381 repress its expression in the dorsal side to prevent SM fate. HL-8, the C elegans Twist ortholog, functions in pattering the lineage with roles in cleavage, proliferation, and differentiation. This study provides insight into relationships between factors in lineage development and the SoxC factor SEM-2.
