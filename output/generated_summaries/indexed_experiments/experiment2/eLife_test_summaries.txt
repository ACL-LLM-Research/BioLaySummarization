Researchers investigated the structure of electrical synapses, a type of neuronal communication that occurs through gap junctions between cells, in zebraf Mauth cells. They used expansion microscopy to map the spatial distribution of proteins at single synaptic contacts where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Multiple gap junctions of varying size were identified, with most of the synaptic surface occupied by gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association between these structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small portions of the contact, indicating most of the area functions as an electrical synapse. The study revealed the organization of an electrical syn that operates with multiple gap junctions, in association with structural and signaling molecules of adherens junction. This relationship will aid in establishing boundaries of electrical syn found in animal connectomes and provide insight into structural and functional diversity of synapses.
Researchers investigated the role of the pre-Bötzinger complex (preötC), a primary generator of inspiratory breathing rhythm, and its neurons that project to the facial nucleus (7) motor neurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To understand the identity of 7-projecting preöt neurons, a combination of optogenetic and viral approaches were used to demonstrate selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects facial pad activity with minimal effects on breathing. These effects were altered by the type of anesthetic and anesthetized or conscious states. The population of 7-projecting preöt neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons also sending collaterals to brainstem nuclei regulating autonomic activity. Modulation of subgroups of preöt neurons based on axonal projections is a strategy to understand mechanisms coordinating breathing with motor and physiological behaviors. This is fundamental as abnormal respiratory autonomic and oracial behaviors are associated with disease development and progression.

The study questioned whether preöt7 neurons are part of the respiratory network or distinct group. Data suggest facial projecting preöt neurons transmit rhythm rather than generate it. Photoinhibiting these on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals. Selective photoin of preöt projecting to nucleus 7 modulates oracial with minimal respiratory activity. A combinatorial transgenic approach was used with virus providing cre-recombin expression and retroaxonal delivery. Selective transduction and photoin pre facial premotor affects activity minimally breathing. Non-selective photoin had small effects breathing, particularly ketamine/medetomidine and recovery. Selective approach observed smaller population with restricted location.

Photoin preöt produces apnea, reduces sympathetic activity, respiratory modulation BP, increases parasympathetic HR, and sinus arrhythmia. Neurons preöt modulate oracial behaviors.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and serve as a general alarm to the brain. If CGRP neurons act as a true alarm, their activation would modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude of the threat. However, most research has focused on the role of CGRP in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. This study examined the role of CGRP in active behavior using a predator-like programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed CGRP encodes the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention, presumably amplifying the perception of threat as more imminent. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand understanding of CGRP in PBN as a critical system, capable of regulating active behaviors by amplifying perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying danger.

The study suggests CG activation amplifies perceived threat, promoting active behaviors. Optogenically inhibited CG in animals while being chased during conditioning, showed less freezing and fleeing compared to control. CGRP, known for relaying US to fore and inducing freezing, were examined in active responses. A natural paradigm with robot and aversive stimuli varying levels, recorded activity found CG encode threat through variations in duration and amplitude. Results confirmed stimulating CG without aversive generates rapid, unconditioned behavior in mice. Tested manipulating activity CG during fear with robot promotes or amplifies behavior. To enhance alarm, activation was applied at Hz during chasing. Optogen stimulation in absence induced robust, and activation conventional further conditioned, demonstrating primary in passive responses. However, heightened conditions, such as CG or robot speeds, also strengthened active behaviors amplifying perceived.

A more ecologically relevant paradigm using predator robot was employed, incorporating imminent threat. Hypothesized CG modulate behaviors on severity or type. Recorded activity response aversive, including robot to determine encode stimuli differentially.
Researchers used diffusion-weighted MRI data from approximately 30,000 UK Biob participants to investigate the relationship between obesity and brain structure. They found that a higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was associated with differences in two distinct brain systems: the prefrontal/temporal/striatal system, associated with isotropic volume fraction (ISO), and the medial/occipital/statal system associated with intra-cellular fraction (IC). The ISO system was linked to genes for innate functions, glial density, and mu-opioid receptor density, while the IC system was linked to G-protein receptors and decreased mu-opioid receptor density. The researchers estimated genetic correlations between WHR and ISO (r=0.026, P=0.36) and IC (r=0.112, P9×10-4) as well as correlations between WH maps and equivalent CRP for ISO and IC (P<0.05). These results suggest a two-way mechanistic model where genetically determined neurite density in the medial system may contribute to obesity and water content in the prefrontal system reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate system. 

The anatomical pattern was previously activated by fMRI tasks involving episodic memory and navigation. ISO and IC maps were negatively correlated (r=-0.366, P2.3×10-13). The researchers tested each metric at each region for association with WHR and identified two anatomically and functionally distinct systems associated with obesity using gene expression, composition, and neurotransmitter density to refine characterization of obesity system. They completed further analyses to explore the direction of relationship between obesity and brain structure. Genome-wide statistics for ISO and IC (Warrier et al,202) and WH (Pul et,201) estimated correlations between MRI and WH, testing the hypothesis WH would have tighter correlation with IC than ISO. They used data on brain distribution of neurotransmitters (Hansen et,202) to investigate systems where obesity was associated with microstructure ISO or IC. Cortical maps of 37 neurotransmitters were tested for co-location with ISO and IC maps, controlling multiple comparisons.
Researchers have investigated the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergoing epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) in driving metastatic dissemination in cancer models. However, the presence of tumour cells undergoing EMT has not been observed in human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to cancer uncertain. The study identified EpCAM and CD as CSC markers alongside mesenchymal Viment as EMT markers in oral cancer cells, allowing the investigation of these markers in human tumours. Examining 12,000 fields from 74 oral tumours, a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD, and Viment co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour in metastatic specimens was observed. An artificial neural network predicted metastasis with 87-89% accuracy. This study observed disseminating EMTs in human cancer specimens, highly predictive of metastatic disease.

Staining Ep and CD alongside mesenchym Viment in 12,000 fields from human tumours stratified on metastatic status identified cells that undergone EMT and disseminated into stroma surrounding primary tumours. Image-based machine learning showed presence of EMTs in tumroma predictive of metastasis. Presence of disseminating cells strongly correlated with metastasis. Image-based approach predicted metast with high accuracy through EMT staining. Immunofluorescence for EMT retaining epithelial Ep and mesenchym Viment and CSC CD identified single EMT disseminating stroma oral tumours, however epithelial retained. Ep not sufficient alongside Viment mark disseminating EMT correlate metastasis.

Study's strength was ability to observe single cell automated fashion across thousands fields human tumours, enabling to identify disseminating EMTs and train ANN predict metastasis. Viment distinguishes E epith tum cells immunofluores protocols. Combining Ep tum lineage EMT marker, Viment mesenchal, and CD EMT marker aimed to identify cells undergone E and disseminated stroma region.
Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study the dynamics of early inflammation in mouse skin wounds and found that apoptotic and efferocyt pathways are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including Ly6+ macrophages. In diabetic wounds, human upregulation of mRNAs for efferytosis genes and altered eocyt signaling via receptor Axl and its ligand Gas was detected. Early in mouse wounds, upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR-independent mechanisms was observed. In vivo studies revealed that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but dispensable for eocytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another eocyt receptor, Tim4, in mouse wounds decreased eocyt and abated repair. The study highlights distinct mechanisms of apoptotic cell detection in tissue repair and potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled the creation of transcriptomic atlases, which provide insights into gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying cell types corresponding to gene clusters in single-cell sequencing sets remains a challenge. Researchers have developed a genetic barcoding approach, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplex (Ta-EM), which utilizes Drosophila's genetic tools for in vivo tagging defined populations. Ta-EM involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-inducible UASFP construct, allowing the barcode to be read during single-cell sequencing, labeling a population of interest. This method enables identification of cell types in atlases, multiplet droplets, and barcoding time, conditions, and replicates. Additionally, TaEM barcodes can be read using next-generation sequencing for population-scale measurements, facilitating large-scale behavioral screens and multiplexing single-cell transcriptomic experiments.

A geneticcoding strategy, Ta-EM, has been developed for various experimental contexts. The barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded lines using next-generation sequencing. The method involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-indible UASFP construct, allowing the sequence to be read during droplet single-cell sequencing, labeling a population of interest. This provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for detection single sequencing, and can be used for multip behavioral or phenotypic measurements, offering a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms.

A limitation of TaEM is that barcodes are not observed in all single-cell expression data, possibly due to the strength of the Gal driver. However, variable recovery of barcodes driven by the same Gal driver have been observed.
Researchers have investigated the evolution of novel phenotypes in the Dendrobatidae family of frogs, which have developed the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for defense. However, previous studies have focused on colorful species with alkaloids, neglecting inconspic ones assumed to be undefended. This incomplete understanding of chemical defense in the group is addressed by new data showing that undefended species have measurable amounts of alkaloids. Undefended frogs consume mites and ants, sources of alkaloids, suggesting diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. A phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration is proposed, differing from sestration in lacking transport and storage mechanisms, yet resulting in low toxin accumulation. The concept of passive accumulation and its role in origin of chemical defenses in poison and toxin-sequest organisms is discussed. Incorporating pharmacokinetic ideas and new data, an evolutionary model explaining acquired defenses in animals and toxin fate of ingested is proposed.
Epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) plays a significant role in chemotherapy resistance and is a challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving redundant pro-EM signaling pathways and its reversal process, mesymal-to-epithelial (MET), has hindered treatment development. Researchers used a Tri-PMT E lineage-tracing model and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) to analyze EMT status of tumor cells. Findings revealed ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) during EMT and MET phases. Ribi and subsequent protein synthesis by ER and mTOR signaling are essential for EMT completion. Inhibiting Ribi genetically or pharmacologically impaired EMT capability of tumor cells. Combining Ribi with chemotherapy reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesymal cells under chemotherapies. The study suggests targeting Ribi pathway a strategy for treating advanced breast cancer.

Employing E-lineageacing model, researchers found Ribi transiently elevated during EMT and MET phases. Activation of Ribi diminished tumor phenotype changes. Lower Ribi activity observed in mesal cells than epithelial. Consistent with Triy model, BM21 combined with CT reduced metastatic tumor burden than mock or mono-treatment. Investigating Ribi association with E status in human breast cancer, scRNA data analyzed primary cells from patients. Targeting E for therapy challenging due E complexity and MET controversies promoting progression. E-lineacing model found upregulation Ribi at E and MET phases. Activation Ribi during E process reported previously. Results suggested upregulated Ribi needed mesal cells undergo MET outgrowth lungs. Ribogenesis recognized factor in cancer pathogenesis. Investigating pathways responsible R upregulation E process, sorted cells and probed signaling. Involvement unwed R activities E and MET makes R new target E-related chemoresistance and metastasis. Targeting Ribi RNase impaired E transitioning and synergized chemotherapeutics.
Pearl millet, a heat- and drought-tolerant cereal crop, is a vital food source in the sub-Saharan region. Its early root system features a fast-growing primary root, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using modeling, we demonstrate that drought is a significant constraint in Sahelian agroecosystems where pearl millet was domesticated. We show that increased millet primary root growth is correlated with increased water tolerance in field conditions. A genome-wide study and quantitative trait loci (QTL) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this trait. Combining gene expression, resequencing, and reannotation of these regions, a glutaredin-encoding gene PgXC9 is identified as a candidate resilience root regulator. Functional characterization of its Arabidopsis homolog AtGR19 reveals a role in regulating cell elongation. Our study suggests a conserved function for GR genes in root elongation and resilience in pearl to Sahelian environment.

Drought was observed in 57% of years, confirming drought is a major constraint in Sahelian agroosystems affecting crops during vegetative stage. To test if fast primary root growth after germination is an adaptation to drought, we phenotyped a panel of millet lines representative of genetic diversity. Seminal roots are present in millet and lateral roots at 6 days after germination. We hypothesized the fast primary root is adaptation to Sahelian. We show drought after germination is a constraint in Sah and primary growth correlated with tolerance under conditions in millet. Correlations between variables showed a strong relationship between primary growth and stay at veget, an indicator of drought tolerance (R=0.95, p<0.01). Field experiments support rapid primary growth beneficial for millet to cope with drought episodes.

Differences in growth regulated by changes in elong. Genome-wide association and bulk segregant analysis identified a genomic region controlling trait. Combining RNA, resequencing and reannotation, a glutinencoding Pg9 is a potential regulator. Effect of promoter polymorphisms on expression needs to be tested. To validate, we studied its ortholog in Arabidopsis as functional studies not possible in millet.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes and represents concrete and abstract concepts during real-world experiences, such as watching a movie. They found that concrete and abstract concepts encode different types of information in separate brain regions, but these differences decrease when multimodal context is considered. When abstract words are processed in scenes related to their meaning, the response becomes more concrete-like, and when unrelated, it resembles abstract processing. This suggests that concepts encode experiences, but neurobiological organisation is dynamic and depends on context.

The brain integrates information across sensory modalities to form coherent concepts, a critical for real-world experiences (Barsal et al., 2018; Smith, 2007). The study highlights visual context's role in modulating abstract and concrete word representation, similar effects may occur in other sensory contexts. They tested if profiles change depending on objects in context, predicting abstract concepts in related contexts (e.g. "love" while watching people kissing) engage concrete processing regions and visual information.

First, they examined where concrete and abstract concepts are processed across contexts and information they encode. Hypothesized representations reflect contextual information, expected regions of typical experiences (e.g. learning) activate across contexts. Conversely, concrete displaced from context (e.g. "apple" while house interior) engage abstract regions processing internal/interceptive/affective information.

A second analysis aimed to understand representations change as a function of context (Barsal et al, 2018). Activation underlying concrete and conceptual fundamentally changes as a function of visual context.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screen to identify mediators of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in human cells, a cellular pathway that conceals neoantigens by destroying RNA from genes with truncating mutations. The screen implicated SMG1, a kinase that phosphorylates UP1, as a potential disruptor of N. This led to the design of a novel SM1 inhibitor, KVS1, that elevates expression of transcripts and proteins from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and in vivo. K1 concomitantly increased presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I peptides from N-downregulated proteins on the surface of cancer cells. K1 provides opportunities for studying N and diseases where N plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

Inhibition of K1 at low concentrations as 600nM led to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting total blockade of N pathway. Western blotting showed K1 decreases phosphorylated UP1, target of SM1 activity in three cell lines. Previous studies with non-specific N inhibitors showed increase in antigens from tumor mutations when N is inhibited. Researchers investigated whether K1 could alter surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncations in cancer cells. Treatment of cells with SM1-specific inhibitor SM11 resulted in increases transcripts and proteins from genes with truncations, as did LY341. SM11 displayed SM specificity and inhibition but was insoluble. The screen offered unbiased assessment of targets for N disruption, concluding SM was ideal to inhibit. K was developed to improve biophysical properties of SM11 through K1.

A cell-based assay queried effects of a library on N function, identifying a compound capable of inhibiting N and its target SM1, a critical of N.
A study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biob found that age is the most significant risk factor for cancer, but aging rates vary across individuals. A new measure, PhenoAge, was used to predict site-specific and overall cancer risk. PhenoAge was calculated using chronological age and biomarkers, and PhenoAcc subtracted the effect of chronological age by regression and incidence-weighted cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS). Compared to biologically younger participants, older individuals had a higher overall cancer risk, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic and PhenoAcc was observed on overall risk, with HR of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) with high genetic and oldereno compared to low risk and youngereno. PhenoAcc was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors (β=-0.01 in men, p<0.001; β=-0.98 in women, p<0.001). Within genetic groups, oldereno was related to increased cancer risk, adjusting for chronological age, which could be retarded by adherence to a healthy lifestyle. This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China and Jiangsu Province.
A new mobile app, Biome, has been launched in Japan to gather species observations from the public using species identification and gamification elements. Since its launch in 2019, the app has amassed over 6 million observations. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) estimate species distribution while accommodating bias. This study investigated the quality of Bi data and its impact on SD performance. Species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but plants, molluscs, and fishes scored below 90. SDMs for 132 terrestrial and animals across Japan revealed incorporating Bi data into traditional data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data required over 200 records for accurate (Boyce ≥ 0.9), while blending two sources reduced to around 300. The coverage of urban-natural gradients by Bi data compared to traditional biased natural areas may explain this improvement. Combining data estimates species distributions, aiding protected area and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform accumulating community-sourced data contributes to conserving and monitoring ecosystems.

The study assessed the quality of community data through smartphone app Bi and its impact on species distribution prediction. Species models (SD) are statistical tools assessing biodiversity while accounting biases. SD use occurrence and conditions to estimate ranges and habitats (Booth et al, 2014; Box, 198; Elith et,201; Hutchinson,195; Phillips,200). The inclusion of Bi data improved SD accuracy (Figure 3). Most accurate predictions when data consisted 50-70 Bi (Appendix 1), highlighting both surveys for comprehensive understanding distributions (Miller et,201; Pacific,201; Robinson,202). SD based two types: (i) traditional (forest census, museum, research) and (ii) mixture Bi data compared performance. Modelled 132 animals and plants Japanese archipelago subtropical boreal areas.
Researchers investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1 (BMPR1)-mediated signaling in lung mesenchymal cells during prenatal lung development using mouse models. They found that ablation of mesenchymal BR1 disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle and subepithelial fibers were found in cystic airways of mesymal BR1 knockout lungs. Additionally, ectopic mesenchym expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of Sox-2/Sox9 proximal axis were detected in mesym BR1 knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad/5, two BMP downstream effectors, from lungyme did not phenoc the cyst abnormalities in mesym BR1 knockout, suggesting a Sm-independent mechanism contributes to pulmonaryic lesions. These findings reveal the first role of mesym BMP in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

The study provides in vivo evidence that BR1-mediated signaling in mesym cells is indispensable for lung development. Lungym deletion of BR1 at early stage causes abnormal morph and severe cyst at gestation in mice. Congenital cysts are reported in human CP patients as result abnormal lung development. Aberrant epithelial growth also contributes air cyst formation, multiple models suggest loss Sox+ or expansion Sox+ in air epithelia associated altered differentiation and cyst pathology fetal lungs. Mesym BR1 is essential for development, particularly air branching.

The study deleted BR in fetal mesym cells, resulting abnormal air development and cystic malformation. Relationship BR1 intracellular signaling and B4 expression in fetal mesym progenitor cells confirmed by B4 expression isolated mesym cells different BR genotypes. Alterations other pathways FGF, Wnt, Sh not detected RNA-seq RT-PCR related genes. Phenotype resembles features pediatric diagnosed CP. Investigating lung caused mesym BR knockout and underlying mechanisms significantly congen lung diseases.
Researchers have investigated the role of anionic lipid molecules, specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), in regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) activity in living cells. Using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy, they visualized EG and PI(4,5)2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells and found that they aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EG) through transient visits of EG to PI(4,5)2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EG stimulation depended on phospholipaseγ, the EG effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)2. Artificial in the PI(4,5)2 content of the plasma membrane reduced the dimer and autosphorylation of EG after stimulation with EG. Inhibition PI(4,5)2 hydrolysis after stimulation decreased phosphorylation EG-Th654. Thus, EG kinase activity and the density PI(4,5)2 around EG molecules were found to be mutually regulated.

The study examined dynamics and functional of PI(4,5)2 as boundary and neighboring lipid EG in activation EG by EGF. Super microscopy revealed EG and PI(4,5 form nanodom that partially overlap before stimulation. The nanodom also form clusters and extent coagregation EG and PI(4,5 molecules in higher structure decreases after stimulation. Researchers found that PI(4,5 nanodom and EG nanocluster together before stimulation. After stimulation, degree cogregation decreases, depends on PLC but not phosphosit3-kinase PIK. Local PI(4,5 around EG stabilizes EG dimers increase EG autosphorylation with EGF. Hydrolysis PI4,5 by PLC plays role deactivation EG. Results suggest remodeling lipid regulates EG activity.
Researchers have identified a unique carrier protein in the parasite Blastocystis that transports glycol intermediates, such as dihydroacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. This carrier is distinct from the human mitochondrial oxoglutar carrier SLC25A11 and dicarboxyl carrier SLC25, as it lacks the ability to transport canonical substrates malate and oxutar. Blastocyst lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation, including complexes III and IV, ATPase, and AD/ATP carriers. The presence of glycol in the matrix generates ATP, powering processes such as macromolecular synthesis and NAD, used by complex I to generate a proton force for protein and molecule import. This carrier represents a potential drug target for stramenile pathogens, which are economically important.
Researchers have proposed a new framework for genetic association studies, called the Haplotype Score (HFS), which calculates a functional activity score for each haplotype in an individual based on a deep learning model. This score replaces the original genotype in traditional association studies. Applying the FS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank dataset, 361 independent FS-trait associations were identified with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, a median of 63 causal findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. FS-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with strong biological interpretability, including 'circadian pathwaychronotype' and 'aridonic-intelligence. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression integrated FS score with SNP-based polygenic scores, showing an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry poly prediction. The study concludes that FS is a promising for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.
Researchers investigated the impact of three different types of mental training modules on the hippocampus, a brain region involved in stress regulation, structure, and function, and behavior, in 332 healthy adults. The training modules focused on attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, and socio-cognitive skills. The study used structural and resting-state functional MRI analysis to evaluate changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic connectivity, and related these changes to diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. The results showed that a 3-month compassion-based training targeting socioffective skills increased bilateral cornu ammonis (CA-3) volume compared to socio-cognitive skills or wait-list control group. This change was paralleled by increased functional connectivity of CA-3 in socioffective compared to socio-cognitive skills. Training-induced changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reduced cortisol output. A multivariate analysis found other subfields not showing group-level changes also contributed to cortisol changes. The study found a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal substructure and function, and cortisol reduction in healthy adults.
Researchers investigated the role of large-effect alleles and inversions in local adaptation in three sunflower species: Helianthus annu, Helthus argyll, and Helthus petolar. They used genome-wide association studies to examine patterns of adaptation in these species, which harbor large species-specific inversions. Results showed significant genome-wide repeatability of association signatures to phenotypes and environments, particularly in regions with inversions. This suggests inversions facilitate local adaptation, but some loci can contribute without recombination suppression in species lacking inversions. Many regions show repeated adaptation, but strongest signatures are species-specific, indicating genic redundancy for local adaptation. 

Non-shared lineages estimated the number of regions contributing to adaptation for each phenotype, related to genic redundancy. Results show local adaptation involves repeatability at few genes, often with inversions, and redundancy across many loci. The study explored repeatability of adaptation in three sunflowers, which harbor large recombination-suppressed regions (haplocks), mostly inversions, associated with traits. Most inversions are 1 million years old, predate current adaptation, but not underlying genes shared among species. 

Results suggest some genome contributes adaptation with low redundancy and repeility, enriched in regions with inversions, while remainder driven by loci with redundancy and species-specific contributions. Repeatability with inv supports adaptation model for long-term persistence of inversions, rather than dominance or meiotic mechanisms.
Researchers have investigated the effects of aging on the mammary epithelium, a layer of two distinct cell types: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells, which are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. They analyzed transcriptomes from younger and older women and found age-dependent changes in gene expression and increased transcriptional variance that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent responses were common to both lineages, while directional changes were mostly detected in luminal epith and involved regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SAT1. Epithelial expression of gap junction protein G6 increased with age, and modulation of G6 in co-cultures revealed it provided communication from myepith to lum cells. Age luminal transcriptomes comprised a signal detectable in tissue aging and transition into cancers. A machine classifier based on lum-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer and was highly predictive of breast subtype. The study suggests luminal epith are the site of aging responses in tissue and their emergent phenotype endows cells to become cancer-cells and a biosensor presages cancer susceptibility.

The study found directional and variant responses contribute to aging biology in breast tissue of older women, with increased variances in transcript profiles across individuals a significant outcome of aging and central to increased susceptibility to cancers with age. Age-dependent and variant responses integrate in epithelia explain changes leading to increased cancer initiation. The mam epithel, origin of carcinomas, is a bilayer of two distinct lineages-myepith and luminal cells. Increased noise during aging led to variances transcript between aged and proposed mechanism underlying differences in breast, particularly lum cancer subtypes. Directional and changes with age led to decrease in L- and MEP expression in older cells. Analyses show variances drivers of loss lineage in epith.
Researchers explored the possibility of using non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing as a proxy for phenotyping to understand the genomic basis of variation in plant resistance to pests. They used whole-genome and epigen sequencing data from 207 lines of the plant species Thlas arven, grown in a common environment with aphids, mildew, and microbes. The study found that the number of non-target reads assigned to pests differed between populations, had significant SNP heritability, and were associated with climate origin and glucosinolate content. Lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid load, indicating decreased resistance. Genome-wide analyses identified genetic variants in defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were found, particularly in transposons and the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. This study provides insights into defense mechanisms of Thlas, a crop model species, and demonstrates non-target sequencing can estimate intensities of plant interactions.
Researchers explored the concept of collateral sensitivity in Plasmodium falciparum, where resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another, as a strategy to suppress resistance emergence. They targeted Plasium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) with a panel of inhibitors, focusing on TDC-125, which was active against all mutants, including DH C276, a line that arose with clinical candidate DSM265. Selection with TDC-125 led to copy number variation in the dhod locus, but one mutation, DHH263, conferred resistance to TDC-125 but not DSM. Selection of DH276 with TDC-125 yielded additional changes in dhod, resulting in double mutants with decreased sensitivity to TDC-125 and high resistance to DSM. Combining DSM and TDC-125 in treatment selected parasites with DH532 mutation, resistant to both and as fit as wildtype in vitro. The emergence of cross-resistant parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of DH.
Researchers have found that the establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance varies greatly across different geographic regions, with most infections occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, but resistant strains emerging in low-transmission regions. Current models of resistance lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and resistance, possibly due to overlooking the interaction between antigen diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. To address this, a novel compartmental model was developed that tracks sensitive and resistant strains, as well as the dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. The results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while decreasing in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study highlights the critical role of malaria diversity in geographic patterns of resistance.

The diversity of Plasium falcum strains among geographic zones drives differences in epidemiological features, yet has not been explicitly considered in mathematical models of resistance. The model shows that diversity and strain-specific immunity, tracked through macroparas structure, predict the complex relationship between transmission and resistance. It implies control protocols should vary regionally and there is no one-size-fits cure for malaria worldwide. The inclusion of diversity provides a mechanistic explanation for Southeast Asia's persisting resistance to certain antimal drugs, despite lower transmission than Africa. In regions with low diversity, parasites cannot reinfect hosts, so clinically immune hosts do not carry infections often.

The study presents a theoretical argument based on a mechanistic model for geographic variation in antimal drug resistance. The Malaria Project did not predict prevalence before 200, while antimal drugs started early 200 in African countries. Comparisons were restricted to studies between 1990 and 200, using 200 as proxy. Studies with less than 20 were excluded.
Researchers investigated the impact of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-THC), the most abundant phytocannabin in cannabis, on early embryonic development using a stepwise in vitro system that captures the embryonic cascade. They found that Δ-TH increases proliferation of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not their primed counterparts, and this effect is dependent on CB receptor binding, associated with moderate transcript changes. However, Δ-TH capitalizes ESCs' metabolic capabilities by increasing glycolytic and anabolic rates. This metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Prim Germ-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and associated with transcriptional alteration. The study reveals the first molecular characterization of Δ-TH impact on early gerine development.
A recent study on the zebraf fish (Danio rerio) has identified a total of 151 NLR genes, significantly more than the previously known 400, with approximately half present in all wild populations and 4% found in 80% or more of individuals. Wild fish have up to twice as many NLR per individual and up to four times as many NLR per population than laboratory strains. In contrast, nucleotide diversity in zebraf NLR genes is low, with half being monomorphic and the remaining having few polymorphisms, indicating purifying selection. This suggests evolution of NLR genes is not neutral. Expression of NLR is often induced by pathogen exposure, but function of most zraf NLR genes unclear. A previous study showed reduced single nucleotide variation in zraf laboratory strains compared to wild, and this study found NLR copy and variation also reduced, likely due to recent population bottleneck in laboratory establishment. Zebraf has hundreds of NLR copies with purifying selection, indicating active diversity-generating mechanisms. The study lays groundwork for investigating molecular and evolutionary mechanisms of large vertebrate gene families.
Researchers have discovered a new species of ovule, Alenia tria gen. sp. nov., from the Famennian period of the Late Devonian, approximately 372-359 million years ago, in Xinhang, Anhui, China. This ovule has three integument wings extending outwards and inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing the nucellus, and is borne on a smooth, dichotomous branch without a cupule. Alenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cup evolved for photosynthetic and wind dispersal functions, indicating the seed originated earlier than wind dispersal mechanisms such as plume and papp, and three or four-winged seeds followed seeds with less wings. Mathematical analysis shows three-wing seeds are more adapted to dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions.

The earliest Famenn ovules lacked integument outgrowths and rarely played a role in wind dispersal, while nearly all Famenn ovules were cupulate, borne in a protecting cupule. The new Alenia ovule represents the second cupulate ovule in the Famenn. Alenia, Guia, and Waria suggest the evolution of novel wings as integ outgrowths and important for seed dispersal by wind appeared early in spermatophytes and manifested in younger lineages. Other dispersal mechanisms, including plumes, papp, and parachutes of seeds, appeared in Permo-Carbonous and Mesic respectively.

The Alenia sp. nov. occurs in Jianchuan mine, China, where fossil forest was discovered in situ of lycid trees Guangend. The terminally borne ovules are three-wing and aculate, implying novel functions of integument. Based on fossil and mathematical analysis, the evolution of wing seeds and dispersal of seeds with different wings is discussed. Alenia suggests photosynthetically and anochorous functions of ovules, indicating diversity of Famenn winged ovules and evolutionary sequence of ovules. Compared to Famenn four-wing ov of Waria and Guia, Alenia with distally extending wings shows advantage anoch. Mathematical implies three-wing ov could efficiently dispersed by wind.
Researchers have identified a new leukemogenic process in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, a type of blood cancer, where RSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur. RSY mediates the neddylation of B-ABL, making it more stable and resistant to degradation. This stability is due to RSY's NED8 ligase activity, which competes with CBL-mediated degradation. RSY also phosphorylates RSY to activate its NED8 ligase activity, further stabilizing B-ABL and promoting disease progression. In contrast, depleting RSY expression or its ligase activity decreased B- stability, inhibiting tumor growth and formation. These findings suggest an alternative to tyrosine kinase inhibitors for oncoprotein leukemic cells and provide a rationale for targeting RSY-mediated B- nedlation in Ph leukemia treatment. RSY is highly expressed with B- in Ph patients and promotes progression by stabilizing the- via nedlation. The study revealed a novel role of RSY in hematology and its inhibition suppressed Ph leukemia survival. RSY's NED8 ligase activity mediated- nedlation to enhance stability promoting leukogenesis Balanced synthesis and degradation are crucial for protein homeostasis and cellular function. B- generation is a characteristic of Ph (Klein et al, 1982). RSY expression correlated with B levels, demonstrating specificity of RSY-mediated nedlation. Our work uncovered RSY's NED8 lig activity in nylating and stabilizing B in Ph pathogenesis and delineate it as a potential therapeutic target for Ph. Results shed light on future investigations extending to other cancers, broadening RSY's involvement in hematology and oncology. Tumor-bearing mice survival was prolonged by RSY knockout compared to controls. Findings indicate RSY is highly expressed with B in Ph and its depletion inhibits Ph progression.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to discover peptoglycan hydrolases, enzymes that break down peptoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls, using antimicrobial peptides derived from bacteriophage lysins. These enzymes are promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct action and low risk of resistance development. A proof-of-concept was demonstrated by identifying five peptogly hyrolases from Acinetobacter baumannii proteome using Ply307 lys-derived antimicrobial peptide as a template. Two, PH10 and PH11, showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after 1 hour at 100°C, while others were thermosensitive. Crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 revealed PH10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme via dimer transition, while PH8 formed a monomer. Mouse models confirmed safety and efficacy of PH10. This antimicrobial-prim strategy provides clues for discovering promising antimicrobial drugs.
Researchers conducted a retrospective study using data from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and electronic health records (EHRs) to investigate symptoms and disease trajectories prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The study included 6.9 million patients from 1994 to 2018, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish Cancer Registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement the registry codes, a text mining approach was used to extract symptoms from clinical notes in HRs of 307 cancer patients and 30,780 controls. Both sources were used to generate and compare symptom trajectories to uncover patterns prior to pancreatic diagnosis. The study found that text mining clinical notes captured more symptoms before diagnosis than registry-based analysis, including 'blood pressure without diagnosis', 'abnormal heartbeat', and 'intestinal obstruction'. Trajectories identified two groups with lower survival <90 days: 'Cough→jaundiceintestinal' and 'pain→jaiceabnormal function'. The study compared symptom trajectories from registry and EHR data to characterize temporal ordering across sources. Statistically significant disease and symptom trajectories were found prior to cancer, which may be assessed as risk factors for screening. Symptoms were more abundant in EHRs than NPR. Future applications could leverage AI and text mining to build multi-modal trajectories for early cancer prediction in clinics, serving as a guide for screening and improving lives.
Researchers investigated the synchronization of fast spindle activity (12.5-16 Hz) and slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep in children and adolescents aged 5-6, 8, 11, 14, and 18 years, and adults 20-26 years. They found that the coupling between slow oscillations and spindles was evident in all age groups, but less precise in children. Measures of spindle maturity indicated similarity to adult-like fast sples and oscill maturity reflected the extent of slow oscillation dominance. The study found that spindle maturity was associated with enhanced oscill-spindle strength and precision across age groups. Results suggest the ability to generate adult-like fast sples enables precise oscill-sp patterns from childhood to young adulthood. 

To determine dominant oscillatory rhythms in four age groups, researchers analyzed spindle frequencies (9-16 Hz) of background-corrected power during nonapid eye sleep (N2, N3) at frontal and centro-parietal electrodes. Slow and fast sples typically dominate, respectively. Analyses suggested sples in adult fast range rather than development-specific sples are coupled to slow oscillations in all groups. The maturation of development sples to adult sp may explain age differences in strength and precision of oscill-sp patterns. Despite higher frequency of adult sples in child and adolescent groups, age differences in amplitude and density between development and adult centroles decreased in adolescent and adult groups. Sples become more adult-like in frequency and amplitude during maturation. Slow sples were reported to mature and dominate early childhood. To capture maturation stage of sp, researchers computed distance between development and adult sp within each individual. Calculated measures sp characteristics (frequency, density) between adult and development sp.
Researchers have found that despite advancements in high-throughput technologies identifying novel genes associated with biological processes and diseases, many genes published prior to the Human Genome Project in 2003 are still being featured in present-day publications. This persistence suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-stud genes between the completion of experiments and reporting of results. Conversely, understud genes may even accrue more citations. Among 45 biological factors proposed to affect gene selection, 33 are associated with choice of genes in titles and abstracts of studies. A tool, find understud genes (FM), was developed to promote investigation of understud genes by identifying bias during selection. FM was demonstrated through identification of underst genes in vertebrate aging. FM is available for download at fm.amal.northwestern.edu as a MacOS/Windows app.

The abandonment of understud genes is driven by researchers' concern that less-investigated genes yield lower impact, as observed by Katscher et al. (2022) and Piffer and Hoffmann (2007). To identify when understud genes are ignored, a pipeline from biological to results to write-up must be traversed. Results must be extended by subsequent research. Lack of publications is not explained by lack of evidence, as observed by Haynes et al (2016), Border et al (2019), Stoeger and Amar (202), Zhang (202), and Byrne (202). Understud genes are frequently found in high-through experiments but not investigated by authors. FM combined insights to promote understud genes. Several tools aim to publicize understud genes, such as Due et al (2018), Crow (2019), Perdig and (2019), Esian (202), She (1), Higgins (2), Wberg (1), and Rocha. There may be no incentive for authors to highlight understud genes. Factors proposed to limit understud genes range from evolutionary to chemical, such as homologs in primates.
Researchers have established a zebraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis, similar to the characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), induced by high glucose treatment. Using this model, they investigated the effects of non-caloric monosacides on blood vessel development and molecular mechanisms. The study found that glucose and non-caloric monosides induce excessive formation of intersegmental vessels (ISVs), excessively branched vessels formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of ECs exposed to high glucose revealed an increased ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated pro-angiogenic genes. Further experiments validated that Foxo mediated excessive angiogenesis by non-calosides upregulating Marckla expression. This study provides evidence of negative effects of non-calosides on vascular system and underlying mechanisms.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes and stores multiple sequences of information in working memory (WM). Participants memorized sequences of items with different colors and locations and then reproduced the color and location sequences in order. The study manipulated the consistency between location and color trajectories. Results showed that sequences with consistent trajectories improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Sequences with consistent trajectories showed neural reactivation of trajectories and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Neural reactivation correlated with WM behavior. 

EEG recordings provided evidence for a compressive strategy, reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and replay of color sequences during recall. Structure reactivation related to WM and replay. Shared structures enabled storage of multiple sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating information organization in WM. When subjects prepared to reproduce location during recall, the task-relevant color demonstrated spontaneous replay, highlighting the bond between color and sequences sharing a trajectory. With color-location correlation in behavior, findings suggest replay mechanisms in WM mediate combinations based on structures. 

Behavioral and neural evidence converged for leveraging common structures to facilitate WM. Sequences with color-location aligned (condition) showed enhanced memory and correlation between color and sequence trajectories. Neural replay has been posited to represent structure (Huang et al, 2018; Liu et al 2019), structure inference (Liu et al 202b), and generalization (Barry and Love 202). When subjects prepared recall location, replay occurred for color but not sequences, supporting spontaneous replay since features not task-relevant.
Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder PUR syndrome, characterized by full penetrance, meaning that almost all mutations in the nucleic acid-binding protein result in the disease. Researchers investigated how these mutations affect the protein's structure and function. They found that mutations in PUR impair its localization to processing bodies, either destroying its integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization. The team solved the crystal structures of the N and C-terminal domains of human PUR and combined with molecular simulations and nuclear resonance measurements. The results showed high dynamics and promiscuity of PUR, making it susceptible to mutations. This explains why even conservative mutations in PUR result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome.

The study found modest structural alterations must result in functional impairment, supported by the crystal structure of the K97 variant with a solvent-exposed chain. Molecular simulations indicated high motions in the N-terminal domain. Unlike other genetic disorders, such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, pathogenic variations in PUR are found along the entire sequence. The study assessed the structure and function of human PUR and the impact of PUR syndrome-causing mutations on its integrity. Over 270 pathogenic variants in PUR have been identified in 650 patients with PUR syndrome.

The study provides the first experimental assessment of effects of PUR syndrome-causing on folding, nucleic binding, unwinding, and subcellular localization to granules. Some variants of PUR were predicted to have folding defects. The research aimed to understand how variations affect the protein's functional and structural integrity.
A study investigated the interaction between transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TR4) and anoctamin 1 (AN1) in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads, suggesting a role in temperature-dependent perspiration. TR4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, AN1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in sweat glands. TR4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were inhibited by menthol, and acetylcholine-stimulated sweating was temperature-dependent in wild-type but not TR4-deficient mice, and inhibited by menthol in wild-type and TRPMKO mice. Basal sweating without acetylch stimulation was inhibited by AN1 inhibitor. TR4 expression was higher in normidrotic skin from patients with acquired generalized anhidrosis (AG) compared to anhidrotic skin from AG. The study suggests TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interaction with AN1, and TR4 or TR4/AN1 complex could be targeted for pers regulation.

 TR4-expressing secretory cells are involved in secretion of macromolecular components as well as water and ions. TR4 is expressed in human eccrine glands. Sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons, acetylcholine (Ach) is released from nerve endings. The interaction of TR4 and AN1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and friction. TR4 expression was examined in sweat glands of mouse pads. WT glands responded to TR4 agonist GSK and Ach. Temperature-dependent basal sweating without stimulation was observed in WT but not TR4 mice. Menthol, a TR8 activator, inhibits AN1 function, suggesting menthol inhibits sweating. Expression of TR4, AN1, and AQP was detected in ecc glands of mouse pads.
Researchers have developed a new way to describe the shape and size of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for processing information, across different species. They found that all cortices can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes, and when these folds merge, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free trajectory that overlaps with 70 other mammalian species. This indicates that all cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This new understanding enables precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. The researchers demonstrated the importance of this understanding by showing a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology, with a more than fourfold increase in size from two to eight standard deviations at a scale of 2mm compared to standard morphological analyses. This new understanding may generate biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future.

The researchers propose a new syntax for characterizing brain morphology and morphological changes by expressing it as a function of scale, which is more detailed than a list of morphometric measures and more than listing sulci and gyri. This allows for biological processes to act on specific scales leaving others untouched, such as ageing. The study suggests a universal blueprint for mammalian brain and common mechanisms governing folding. The new method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate morphological changes better than metrics at single scale, with comparable sizes for classification. The study demonstrates universal self-similar scaling for primate and mammalian cortices, with fractal dimension 2.5 for all.
Researchers investigated the role of the NF-κB transcription factor REL in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, a type of pancreatic cancer. They used live-cell imaging to observe the dynamics of REL in PDAC cells and found that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNα) induces rapid, sustained, non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of REL. Analysis of single-cell datasets revealed REL heterogeneity in PDAC cells is dependent on actin dynamics. RNA sequencing identified distinct REL-regulated gene expression in PD cells, including TNα-induced upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARHG31. Knockdown of ARHG and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics in PD cells, establishing a negative feedback loop regulating REL activation by TNα. The study also characterized the NF-κ pathway in PD cells, identifying NF-κ/Iκ proteins interacting with REL in the presence or absence of TNα. The results suggest interdependence between the actin network and NF-κ pathway with REL translocation in PDAC. 

The researchers used RNA sequencing to identify genes with distinct expression patterns based on TNα and REL activation. Live imaging with knockdown of targets revealed novel mechanisms regulating REL dynamics in PD, including negative loops between REL and actin modulators NU2 and AR31, and REL and non-canonical NFκ protein RELB. The NFκ pathway was characterized in PD cells, and actin modulators ARHG/NU were found to be REL targets and regulators of nuclear REL with TNα, mediating the relationship between act and REL. In contrast, NF1 and NF2 showed increased interaction with REL TNα, forming NF-κ heteromers with REL, NF1 and NF2 in PD cells. The effect of siRNA knockdown of TN-regulated genes on TN-stimulated REL was evaluated, suggesting Iκ plays a role in suppressing TN induction of REL in PD cells. REL was found to be modulated by NFκ/I proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues.
A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is essential for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are common in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphase Tens Hom (PTEN), the main regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate/Akt pathway, are associated with ASD. However, it is unclear if PTEN can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using Caenorhabditis elegans neuromus system, both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABA) inputs regulate muscle activity, d-18/EN mutations impact GABA but not cholin development and function. This results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. Defects in the GABA system d-18EN mutants are due to reduced D-16 activity during development. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have proven effective for disorders with E imbalances. However, mechanisms remain elusive. A diet with ketone body-hydrobutyrate during development induces D-16 activity, improving GABA development in d-EN mutants. This study links PT mutations and neurodevelopment defects and delves mechanisms underlying KD effects.
Researchers have discovered that the innate immune system's response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus plays a crucial role in the development of COVID-19, with pro-inflammatory cytokines being key to containing the virus. Using quantitative and qualitative models, they found that human monocytes secrete factors that inhibit SARSV-2-induced cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, interleukin-1 (IL-1) was identified as a key mediator that inhibits syncytia formation by various SARS-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1 activates the Rho/RO signaling pathway through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor, driving actin enrichment at cell junctions, preventing syncytia. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed IL-1 restricted SARS-2 spread in lung epithelium. The study reveals IL-1's function and mechanism in SARS-2-induced cell fusion, highlighting an antiviral role for cytokines in viral infection. 

The study demonstrated IL-1's function in inhibiting SARS-2 syncytia formation and innate factors against coronavirus transmission, providing potential therapeutic targets for control. IL-1 inhibited various SARS-2 and betacoronaviruses-induced cell fusion. IL-1, a key inflammatory factor, inhibited S-2-induced syncytia in cells by activating R/RO pathway to actin formation at cell interface S-2-infected and neighboring cells. IL-1 significantly reduced S-2 transmission in lung epithelial mice in vivo. Fluorescence staining showed S-2-infected epithelial fused with cells promoting transmission, while IL- induced actin bundles restricting syncia and transmission. Mechanistically, IL- activates R to cell junction S-2-infected and neighboring via IL- signal initiating actin, preventing fusion and spreading.
Researchers investigated the role of insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in Drosophila, which are analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, in regulating metabolic homeostasis. Using electrophysiological recordings, they found that IPC activity is strongly modulated by nutritional state, decreasing during starvation and increasing after feeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, similar to the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application. In contrast, diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the parsintercerealis (DH44s) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional experiments showed DH44s do not affect IPC activity, while other DHNs inhibit them, indicating parallel populations of autonom and systemically sensing neurons work to maintain homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety effect on food-search behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, while activating DHNs increased hyperactivity. The study demonstrates IPC and DHNs are integral to a modulatory network regulating glucose homeostasis and behavior in response to metabolic shifts.
Researchers have developed a method to efficiently generate endogenous tags in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using the splitNeGreen protein. Endogenous tagging allows for the visualization of proteins in live cells, but generating human cell lines with endogenous tags is challenging due to low homology-directed repair efficiency. The splitNeGreen system was used to create a large-scale endogenous library in HEK cells, and now applied to iPSCs to study protein function in healthy and differentiated cells. An iP line was engineered to express the fragment of splitGreen (NG-10), enabling fast and efficient endogenous tagging with the fragment (NG). Live imaging of dynamic processes like cytokinesis in iPSCs was achieved using neural network-based restoration. This work lays the groundwork for a genome-wide endogenous library in human cells to study protein function in stem and across cell types.

The splitGreen system was used for endogenous tagging in iPSC (Figure 1). A human iP line was engineered to constitutively express NG-10, validated and named NG-P (splitGreen parental line). As proof-of-concept, multiple genes were targeted for endogenous with NG, and tagged iP lines were isolated. This provides a foundation for a genome-wide endogenous library in stem cells and protocols to generate endogenous in iP.

The splitGreen system has high complement efficiency and irreversible once reconstituted protein folded (Feng et al, 2019; Kö et al,2018). splitGreen retains brightness of originalGreen (Feng et,201). This enables efficient endogenous with NG in cells where NG-10 is constitutively expressed ( et,202; et, et,202; et,201). A genome library of tagged proteins in cells requires high-throughput. Self-complementing fluorescent proteins can be used for large endogenous (eng et,201; et,201; et,201; et,202; et,202).
Researchers have developed a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted intracortical multielectro probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current for controlled repeatable lesions in awake animals. The performance of this lesion technique was validated using histology ex vivo and in vivo, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesion. This method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submill precision the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after lesion. The technique can be used in areas of cortex, several species, and theoretically with multielectrode. The low-cost lesion device can easily be adopted into existing electrophiology setup. This is expected to enable causal investigations of the population's role in neuronal function while providing insight into reorganization after loss.

The method was demonstrated using a microelectro array compatible with electrophys recording of activity pre- and postion. A custom source was built to ensure stable current delivery throughout lesion, for repeated, as well as different types and animals. The design can be used creating intrac electrodes for elctrophiology and electrolytic. The technique works with multact probe testing in vivo rabbit cortex. There are no limitations preventing specific from working any multielect probe. The method enables small inactivation while maintaining neuroelectroph recordings. Selection of pattern, amplitude, duration, and location offers combinations for investigations the role of activity. This demonstrates lesion spanning probes rabbits, pigs, sheep, macaques, and can be used other species, like rats, probes have been implanted.
Bees are crucial pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk due to pesticide use. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of nectar and pollen by insecticides. Studies on neonicotinoids have reported contradictory evidence on whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and avoid them. This study used an assay for detection of aversion combined with single-sens electrophysiology to test the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee (Bombus terreis) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution mimicking nectar of oilseed (Brassica nap). Bees did not avoid solutions containing concentrations of imaclopr, thiamox, clothin, or sulfox spanning six orders of magnitude, even these contained lethal. Only high concentrations altered spiking in gust neurons through slight reduction or change in rate. Data provide strong evidence bumblees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant pesticides using mouthparts. Bees rarely contact nectar with other parts, predict at risk unwittingly consuming pesticides nectar of pesticide crops.

The study used combination behavioural and electrophys to test bumble mouth mechanisms detect pesticides nectar. Feeding assays freely foragers assess detect avoid toxins food (Ma et al, 2016). To test bumble detect neonicoids mouth, quantified structure feeding mouth freely bumble (B impens) similar reported bees neither attracted nor deterred consuming solutions neonicoids, consistent idea cannot detect (Muth et,202). Whether bumble taste neonic food remains unresolved. Be have specialized encoding sugars different other species. Failed evidence neonic pesticides elicited spikes gal GR including nutrient/sugar neurons. Conclusion bees not taste neonic nectar own water challenged study free-flying B terre (Ar et,201).
Researchers investigated the dynamics of Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria parasite, in non-human primates (NHP) in Southeast Asia, where it poses a significant public health concern and barrier to malaria elimination. A meta-analysis of 632 NHP from 148 sites revealed heterogeneous prevalence across the region, with low overall prevalence and high estimates in Malaysian Borneo. Regions with higher NHP prevalence overlap with human infection hotspots, and transmission linked to land conversion and fragmentation. Using remote sensing data and statistical models, they identified relationships between P. know in NHP and forest fragmentation, suggesting higher prevalence contingent on habitat complexity, explaining geographic variation in parasite burden. This study addresses gaps in regional P know epidemiology, indicating simian reservoirs may drive human spillo risk.

The study aimed to assemble a georeferenced dataset of P know in NHP, evaluate variation in N P know prevalence by region, and assess environmental and spatial factors for P know prevalence in NHP across Asia. Human P know infection in Sabah is associated with forest loss, agricultural activities, and fragmentation at multiple spatial scales. Prevalence in hosts is a crucial factor in zoon spillo events. They hypothesized P know in primate species is spatially heterogeneous, higher driven by forest loss and fragmentation, contributing to associations between land use, cover, and P know risk. This study is the first to assess P know in NHP at regional scale, across habitats. Prediction intervals indicate heterogeneity within regions, consistent with variability across sites. Forest plots for prevalence are in Appendix 2. Covariates and P know data fit models to explore relationships between landscape and N malaria.
Researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary history of the beetle family Belidae, a group of phytophagous insects, by integrating molecular and fossil data. The results indicate that the crown group originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinida conifer plants, with larvae likely developing in dead or decaying branches. As Gwana broke up, Belids tracked their host plants to distant landmasses, some shifting to angiosperms and cycads when conifers declined, evolving new troph interactions including broodoll mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorous angperms. The two subfamilies Belinae and Oxycninae originated in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively. The likely ancestral plants of Belidae were Pinida or angiosperms. Belidae originated during the Jurassic in association with gymperms and colonized angperms as the latter rose to dominance in the Cretaceous and Paleogene. The subfamilies diverged during East and West Gwana separation, both lineages developing on ancestral plants.
Researchers have analyzed data from hundreds of samples of hepatocellular carcinomas, a type of liver cancer, to understand how tumors evolve over time and space. They found that tumor cells grow uniformly within the tumor volume, rather than at the surface, and that mutations are dispersed throughout the tumor, contributing to its growth. This study sheds light on early tumor evolution in the body and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology. 

The researchers used genetic data from high-resolution studies (Ling et al, 2015; Li et al,202) to analyze early tumor evolution in vivo. They linked spatial sampling with evolution on a larger scale, comparing primary and metastatic tumors to elucidate metastasis (Jones et al,2008; Zhao et al,2016; Alves et,2019; Hu,2020). They also formed basis for population-genetic approaches analyzing tumor data (Attolini et,201; Williams,2016; Williams,2018). To compare dynamics, they used high-resolution spatial distribution of mutations in tumors. From distribution, inferred spatio principles of tumor evolution: uniform growth across tumor or growth near edge, interplay between tissue dynamics and evolution. They used whole-exome data from hepatocellular carcinomas (Ling et,201; Li,202) to infer earlier tumor stages. Developed metrics intra-tumor heterogeneity leveraging spatial position information. In contrast to surface growth, dispersal mechanism postulated for spatial mutations (Wa et,201). Probed migration between regions multi-sampling, detectable mutations in limited samples.
Researchers have identified a novel neuroendocrine mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism in the insect Copsa chinensis, a species that exhibits distinct summer and winter forms with different morphological phenotypes. The transition from summer to winter form is regulated by low temperature and the receptor CTR, impacting cuticle content and thickness. Burs, also known as tanning hormone, is responsible for hardening and darkening the cuticle. This study reveals the function of Burs and its receptor in the transition from summer to winter in C chinensis. Two subunits of Burs, CBα and CBβ, are regulated by low temperature and CTR and form a heterodimer that mediates the transition by influencing cuticle contents and thickness. The receptor CB-R acts upstream of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer to winter. MicroRNA-2 targets CB-R, contributing to regulation of Burs signaling in seasonal polyism of chin. The findings provide insights into the neuroendocrine mechanism of seasonal polyism and insect B and its receptor.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatment. Lysine methionine substitution residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-KM) is a driver mutation in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape of cells to promote tumorigenesis. H-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting histone deacetylases (HDs) and MY in these tumors. Treatment of H-K27-derived patient cells with Sop, an inhibitor to block MY-driven in vivo, in combination with HD inhibitor Vorin, resulted in substantial decrease in viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigen profiling revealed synergistic effect of this combination in downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenograft showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated with combination. These results highlight combined with HD and MY inhibitors as promising approach for aggressive tumors.

The study proposes a novel strategy targeting epigen and transcriptional pathways in H-K-mut DM tumors. HD inhibition, with MY inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic signatures and reduced growth in vivo. Findings emphasize ep dependencies H-driven gliomas and highlight potential combined treatments for malignancy. Histone acylation pathway is a target for cancer, with pan-deacetyl inhibitors, such as Vor and Panin, inhibiting growth and restoring expression alterations observed malignant. H-K gliomas are characterized deregulation ep pathways affecting post-transl modifications lysine methylation and acylation and lysine methylation on histone Bender et al, Chan et al, Lewis et Kr et, Fur et Harun et. High amplification MY is observed in pediatric-grade gliomas Bucowicz et Mack. H-K gli show high MY and MY genes due ep alterations and variants, resulting viability on MY signaling Kr et Paj et Dubois.

The PIN inhibitor Sop was to downregulate MY genes in vitro and block MY-driven murine neuroblastoma models. To address need effective therapy H-K DM, tested dual targeting histone and MY activation, Vor and Sop, yielding beneficial outcome.
The white-footed deerm (Peromys leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected, the deerm shows no apparent disability or diminished fitness. To model inflammation elicited by pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood of P. leuc, Mus mus, and Ratt norveicus, and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deerm were distinguished from mice and rats by LPS profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages L-treated. P leuc, in contrast to mice and rats, displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower fold-changes in type 1 interfer-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P leuc were noted in Borrelia herms infection model. The phenomenon was associated with reduced transcription endogenous retroirus and cytoplasmic recognition receptors in deerm. Results reveal a mechanism for infection in this species and other animal reservoirs for human disease.

P leuc and mus had differentially expressed genes (DE) in blood, spleen, and liver (Baldama et al, 202). Inflammation of deerm was consistent with 'alternatively' activated or M-type macroage polarization instead of expected 'classically' activated or M-type phenotype observed M mus (Murray et,2014). Mus 'uk activation and 'uk migration were down-regulated DE in mus. Distinct GO for upregulated genes mice deerm were'response virus','response interfer-beta','response-gamma','response protoan', and II interfer signaling. Transcription restrained in de was also noted for M2. Greater foldanges from baseline in P leopus than mus for M8, Sl, S1009, and Ilb, gene interleukin-1. Supplementary lists selected targets with means and intervals for normalized values controls and L-treated mus and L-treated leopus (data).

 leopus continues to thrive while infected with diseases it serves reservoir (Bar,201). Diverse tick pathogens and diseases humans include extracellular Borre burgdorferi (Lyme), intracellular Anap phagtophil (anlas), protoan Babes micro (babes), and Powan flav (encephal). le and LPS mus had similar slopes, but y-intercept shifted upwards ratio neutils lymphocytes blood from L group deerm. Control mice and de and LPS had percentages ~5 monocytes blood; monocyte rose 10 in L de (p0.12). Eosin tended higher de at 3.4 (2-4) than mice 1
Caspases (CASP) are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CAS3 and CAS7 recognize the same consensus motif DD, present in gasder E (GME). However, GME is cleaved by CAS3 but not CAS7. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear. This study identified pyroptic puffer GME that was cleaved by pfish CAS/ and human CAS. Domain swapping between pfish and human CAS and ME showed the ME C-terminus and CAS7 subunit determined cleavage of ME by CAS. CAS7 contains a key residue that governs CAS discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate CAS and most vertebrate except mammalian CAS. In mammals, the residue is conserved non-primates but not prim. However, CAS cleaved human ME but not ME. These findings revealed mechanism of CAS discrimination and divergence of CAS-mediated ME activation in vertebrate. Results also suggested mutation-mediated alteration of CAS enabled divergence and specialization of CAS members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals.

The study found different from human ME, puffer ME belonging to tele lineage was specifically cleaved by CAS and CAS at site to liberate pypt-inducing fragment. In tele, generally exist two ME orthologs, ME and ME. It has been observed that human CAS and share same recognition motif, but not cleaves ME at site (Pba et al; Wang). The mechanism is unknown. This found puffer T. Results suggest independent of ME and CAS in mice, which distanced ME from CAS. Similarly, CAS and ME may have undergone independent, leading to disengagement of ME from relationship CAS.

identified tele ME that can be cleaved fish and human CAS to trigger pyptosis. Mutation of cleavage inhibited pypt and decreased LD release and ME cleavage. Results indicated CAS cleavage required to activate ME-mediated pypt. Since is known ME cle by CAS but not CAS, observation that ME cleaved both human and CAS intrigued to explore mechanism.
Researchers conducted a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy participants. Participants received an initial ketamine bolus of 0.23mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.58mg/hr. Resting-state functional connectivity was measured via global brain connectivity and related to ketamine-induced symptom variation and gene expression. Results showed that ketamine's effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting individual variability. The neural effects of ketamine matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbum (PB) cortical expression patterns in humans, while the mean did not. Behavioral-driven symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, resolvable at the single-subject level. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual variation in response to ketamine and have implications for precise pharmacological biomarkers in psychiatry.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-replicating units of life existed in the form of RNA-like polymers, which autonomously replicated without enzymes. However, this presents a problem: the formation of hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication kinetics, leading to parabolic growth with competitive coexistence and diversity. This study tests the information-maint ability of parabolic growth in multispecies models under constant population and chemostat conditions. Large population sizes and small replication rates favor stable coexistence of replicator species, alleviating the error problem of exponential amplification. Sequence properties and resource competition determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting fluctuations in availability favored cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth may have played a role in preserving sequences generated by abiotic synthesis and providing genetic material to early evolution of ribozymes.

The study aims to quantify the information-maint potential of RNA-like replicators displaying parabolic growth modeled as stochastic dynamics. Replicators are represented individually, copying and energetic constraints are considered. A constant population model investigates diversity-maint mechanisms in the par regime. Parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates for enzyme-free replication, proposing a biochemical mechanism to relax error in RNA systems. A chemostat model is used to validate Darwinian selection by exclusion, considering monomer resources. Increased competition can induce a switch from coexistence to survival of the fittest.

The diversity-maint mechanism of par populations can be used to investigate coevolution of naked and encapsulated replicators. Besides the RNA world hypothesis, other concepts exist, such as metabolism or autotrophic origins. Replicating populations displaying par growth are prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, promoting coexistence. Par growth can sustain unlimited competing species in infinite size.
Researchers have discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 virus's main protease, non-structural protein 5 (Nsp), cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TR1), a host enzyme responsible for post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs. This cleavage leads to a decrease in TR1 protein levels and TR1-catalyzed tRNA modifications in cells infected with SARS-2. The study found that N5 cleaves TR1 at a specific position matching the consensus sequence of SARS-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a mutation in the sequence inhibits N5-dependent proteolysis of TR1. The TR1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA activity and are unable to rescue t modification in TR1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TR1-deficient cells infected with S-2 exhibit reduced intracellular viral RNA levels. These findings suggest that N5-dependent cleavage of TR1 and perturbation of tRNA patterns contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS-2 infection.
Researchers investigated the concept of "accidental virulence," where non-pathogenic microbes become pathogenic due to advantageous traits acquired in their environment. They evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations to adhere to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations, resulting in increased adherence, multicellularity, and pseudohyph growth. When injected into wax larvae, hypermultic strains were more likely to cause death than nonmultic strains. This supports the idea that beneficial traits in the environment can lead to opportunistic pathogens. 

To test the hypothesis, yeast were selected for adherence on a plastic and tested against wax larvae for virulence. Two replicate populations showed increased multicellularity in various forms. Virulence was measured in Galleria mellon larvae, an invertebrate model for microbial pathogenesis and vir, including S cerevis. The selection for adherence led to incidental evolution of hypermult clones and increased virulence. This demonstrates selection on one trait can generate correlated responses in others, a feature of organism evolution. Favoring plastic adherence, common in industrial and medical settings, led to aggregative phenotypes and vir.
Researchers have identified that proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs) are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations, which can lead to the formation of biomolecular condensates. To investigate the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of PLDs, a coarse-grained model, Mpipi, was used to simulate 140 mutants from six proteins: hnPA, T43, F, US, WS, RB14, and T1. The simulations revealed scaling laws that quantify the range of change in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of number and type of amino sequence. These laws are consistent with physicochemical properties of mutations and extend across the tested family, suggesting scaling can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens.

The study demonstrates that for hnPA, there are quantitative rules explaining changes in thermodynamic condens in response to amino-acid mutations. An investigation was conducted to determine if scaling laws can predict critical parameters of broader PLDs in response to amino sequence. Laws are cumulative, meaning effects of successive mutations can be predicted by addition of laws as long as resulting mutation keeps PL composition and patterning. A framework was developed to describe phase of large protein variants via identification of scaling. Scaling can predict stability of condens based on amino sequence.

A systematic approach was used to vary amino sequence of PLDs to determine phase changes with amino compositional perturbations. For each mutation, three types of scaling were defined and tested. Changes in critical temperatures of PL as function of number and type amino mutations can be quantified by scaling, conserved across PL investigated. Data was organized in Table 1, illustrating effect of single mutations on critical temperatures of PL as function of PL length. Consistent with evidence and predictions, interactions involving aromatic residues are dominant in stabilizing condens formed by PL.
Researchers have proposed a new approach to predict an individual's cognitive traits or clinical conditions using brain signals, focusing on the dynamic patterns of brain activity over time, which is often overlooked in current methods that rely on structural or time-averaged measures. The approach uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to describe functional connectivity and amplitude, combined with a Fisher kernel that preserves the underlying model's structure. This method, called H-Fisher, was tested on fMRI data and shown to be accurate and reliable. It was compared to other methods, including time-vary and time-aver functional-based models. The Hisher approach leverages individual's time-vary and functional connectivity for prediction, with applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine.

The study aimed to establish a method that captures brain activity patterns over time to predict traits, demonstrating the Hisher's accuracy and reliability in predicting traits from brain models trained on neuroimaging data. It preserves the model's structure, ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is crucial for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous training and test sets. The Hisher was tested on fMRI data and simulated data, focusing on within-session changes in functional and amplitude from scans, acquired during wakeful rest. Parameters from these models were used to predict behavioral traits. The Hidden Markov Model (H) was used, a probabilistic model of time-vary and functional dynamics. Despite its role in interpreting errors, reliability is often ignored in predicting traits from neuroim features. The Fisher approach preserves the H's structure, predicting traits from brain dynamics accurately and reliably.

The Hisher was compared to kernels ignoring the model's structure (naive) and a method based on Kull-Leibler divergence, and timeaver functional-based methods.
Researchers investigated the role of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRR2) in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease, focusing on its phosphorylation of substrates and regulation. They identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LK2-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate Rab10. Using imaging and immunopurification methods, they showed that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to a local increase in LK activity and phosphorylation of Rab10. PD-linked variants, including LK R144G and V35DN, resulted in increased LK localization to lysosomes and elevated levels of pRab10. The study suggests a conserved mechanism where Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates recruitment of LK and phosphorylation of its substrates at lysosomes.

The researchers hypothesized that enhanced LK recruitment to lysosomes promotes phosphorylation by increasing local concentration of LK in proximity to substrates. They examined two PD-linked variants associated with increased LK activity, L144 and V35DN, and found increased L on lysosomes. Using endogenous conditions, they demonstrated that Rab, but not Rab29, regulates L2-mediated phosphorylation of10 and regulates localization of L on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The pathogenic L variant144, outside LK's domain, and V35 have been shown to increase L activity in previous studies.

The study identifies Rab as a novel regulator of L2 and demonstrates its role in mediating L-dependent phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. They show Rab promotes phosphorylation by recruiting L to lysosomes following lysosomal rupture. Pathogenic variants, including V35 and L144, result in increased L and pR10 on lysosomes. The data delineate a conserved mechanism where L activity is regulated and in response to lysosomal and genetic associated disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze the cell cycle of non-adherent cells, which are challenging to study using current methods. They combined a specialized surface-enhanced cell attachment, FUCCI (CA2) sensor, automated image analysis, and machine learning algorithm to precisely measure cell cycle durations in non-adherent cells. This method was validated in myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi, which have unique cycle characteristics, and tested the impact of cycle-modulating drugs on NB cells. The cell analysis system is also compatible with adherent cells and is fully automated, providing insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This presents a valuable tool for cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive cell analysis in adherent and nonherent cells.

A protocol for cell analysis of adherent and nonherent cells expressing FUCCI (CA) technology is described in a fully automated manner. The experimental workflow is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5. Single cells were followed and annotated according to the color of red and green images in Figure 1, qualitatively confirming the impact of CD inhibitors. The difference in cycle progression of NB4 vs Kasumi cells was evident. Time-lapse images were composed of red and green channels, detecting mCherry and mV markers of FUCCI (CA) indicator.

The method allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per condition using image data pipelines to perform image processing, tracking, filtering, and cycle identification. Image and analysis rely on software Fiji and R, widely used by the community. Scripts are publicly available for customization. This streamlines cell analysis of expressing FUCCI (CA) and makes it accessible to researchers with basic knowledge.
Researchers investigated the relationship between social and ecological constraints on the evolution of cognition in primates by combining cognitive neuroscience and behavioral ecology. They analyzed brain imaging data from 16 primate species to measure the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DFC), involved in metacognition and working memory, and their relation to socioecological variables. The size of these regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily distance traveled (index of ecological constraints), and population (index social). The influence of ecological constraints on FP and DFC volumes suggests that metacognition and working are critical for foraging in primates. FP was more sensitive to social constraints than DFC, in line with studies showing implication in complex interactions. Data highlights the weight of social vs ecological on evolution of prefrontal brain and associated operations in primates.

The study aimed to evaluate the strength of relation between prefrontal regions and socioecological variables across species, observed in the wild, complementing laboratory studies and bridging neurosciences, ecology, and primate evolution. The size of FP and metacognitive skills not related to population but also daily distance. Data compatible with ecological hypothesis (Milton, 1981). Metacognition and working critical foraging in prim, especially when travel long distances and deal complex navigation, in line with ecological hypothesis. The size DFC, proxy working and planning, showed relation daily distance and to lesser population, suggests cognitive in DFC play.
Researchers investigated how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as during exercise, and found that radial growth is largely due to an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than their size. Myofils are the main components of muscle fibers. To study this, they developed a new method, fluorescence imaging myofils with deconvolution (F-ID), which uses a standard microscope to visualize myils with high resolution and contrast. They validated this method by comparing it to electron microscopy and found it was accurate. Using F-ID, they measured the size and number of myils in mouse and human muscles before and after exercise and found that growth is due to an increase in number of myils, not size. This is important for understanding muscle growth and provides a new tool for researchers to study it.
Researchers studied the effects of three mutations in SNAP25, a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, that cause epileptic encephalopathy. Mutations V48 and D166 in the synaptagmin-1 (Sy1) binding interface and I67, which destabilize the SNARE complex, reduced Sy1-dependent vesicle docking to SN-carry liposomes and Ca2-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons. Mutations V and D166 led to reduced readily releable pool (RP) size due to increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy for fusion and increased release probability, gain-of-function not found in Sy1 knockout (KO) neurons; mSC release rates were higher D166 than V in Sy1 KO. Mutations D166 and V increased association to SNs, resulting in unregulated fusion. In contrast, I67 decreased mSC frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due increased energy for fusion, while RP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by lowering energy. Pathogenic mutations in SNAP cause changes in energy for priming and fusion.

The mutations V and D166 preserved charge evoked release and reduced D166 might indicate compensatory gain-function, in addition to impaired Sy1 interaction. Sy and Sy1:SN interactions in ves priming have been controversial. RP is assessed by applying hypertonic solution to neurons, 0.5 M sucrose. Miss mutation in SN bundle I leads increased energy for fusion. Disease display inefficient neuronal survival. SNAP encephal caused by single-point mutations presents interdependent deficits, must overcome for treatment.

Researchers confirmed increase release and decrease by V and D166 previously. In vitro analysis find both lower Sy association SN-protein liposomes. These have consequences understanding role primary SN:Syt in prim and release clamping. Demonstrate challenge mechanism treatments disorders presence multiple caused single mutations. Syt:SN interaction might catalytic lowering energy transition path prim, affect rates. Transient binding Sy might SNAP assist SN complex, whereas mutants prestructure, bypass need Sy
A study analyzing data from 30 countries found a correlation between a higher proportion of women in a discipline and lower research quality and funding rates, affecting both men and women. The research built on previous findings that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it. The study used datasets of thousands of researchers and looked at funding rates and holistic quality scores. A strong correlation was found between researcher quality and discipline gender balance. Both male and female researchers in female-dominated disciplines received lower evaluations, robust to bibliometric differences. Funding rates displayed a similar correlation. Controlling for characteristics like age, institution, and publishing patterns, researchers in male-dominated disciplines had higher success and quality than female-dominated. This applied to both men and women. The findings did not suggest research in female-dominated disciplines is lower quality, but that female disciplines are evaluated as lower than male. This affects everyone, but women more than men.
Researchers have developed a new strategy called "P editing" that enables the use of protein-protein interactions to activate the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system, a powerful tool for modifying the genome in living cells. This approach, termed "protein-protein proximity," links protein interactions to the formation of a functional CRIS-Cas9 guide RNA complex. By engineering the crRNA:acrRNA interaction, the team demonstrated that various protein-protein interactions and chemical dimerization of protein domains can activate editing in human cells. Additionally, they showed that P can be coupled with AD-based RNA sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits within a circuit. This enhances the control of CRPR-based editing, facilitating its use in synthetic circuits in cells.

The team explored whether P can be used with AD-based sensors to control editing based on RNA expression, expanding the range of inputs that can drive specific editing in synthetic circuits. Molecular sensors can control cellular components of synthetic circuits, and outputting genome events to editing may facilitate design such structures, as the range of activities that can be programmed by editing is expanding. P converts interactions directly into genome output, demonstrating that can be used to control editing via specific protein-protein interactions.

To improve efficiency and specificity, the team engineered the crRNA-MS/Box-pacrRNA design. P is based on the dual-gRNA of the CRPR-C9 system, with cr:acr dimer domain replaced with protein RNA aptamers such as MS and Box hairpins. This design mimics functional within the CR-C9, discovered as dual-guided system. The team further developed a proximity sensor that drives genome editing.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3, have been shown to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week (Fernandez et al., 2021). PUFs have been to increase IK currents by dual mechanism of action, characteristically described as 'electric mechanism' (Elinder and Li, 201). According to this mechanism, PUs increase IK currents by shifting voltage of activation (ΔV.

The voltage-gated K channel KCN1, also as Kv.7.1, is in the heart. The channel with accessory KC1 subunit, generating so-called delayed-rect (IK) current, important to repolarizing ventricular potential (Barhan et al., 199; Sanguetti et al.,199; Nerne andass,200). Loss-function of KC1/KC1 complex associated with long syndrome (LTS) (Splski et al.,200; anderman,201). TS mutations reduce channel, leading prolong ventricular waveform seen electrocardiogram as prolonged interval (Ner andass,200; Lars et al.,201). In contrast other channels, such as Shaker K, inactivated low (Larsson and,200; Kur and,200).

Studies suggest mechanism PUs increase KC1/K1 conductance on ability PUs favor conformation selectivity: PUs interactions residues select filter stabilize pore. However, do not shorten interval. Restoring physiological interval achieved increasing KC1/K1 activity (Varney et.,201; Figure). Like channels, KC1 tetrameric structure four-subunits.
Researchers have long known that vitamin B6 deficiency is linked to cognitive impairments in various brain disorders, but the molecular mechanisms behind this link remain unclear and whether vitamin B supplementation improves cognition is uncertain. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate phosphatase (PDX), an enzyme controlling pyridal 5-phosphate (PL) levels, the coenzyme form of vitamin B, may be a therapeutic entry point into B-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological PDX inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. This study identifies PDX-dependent decline in PL levels in the murine hippocampus as a rationale for developing PDX inhibitors. Using small-molecule screening, crystallography, and biolayerometry, researchers discover 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8HF) as a direct PDX inhibitor. 7,8HF binds reversibly inhibits PDX with micromolar affinity and submicrom potency. In hippocal neurons, 7,8HF increases PL in P-dependent manner. These findings validate P as a druggable target. 7,8HF is a well-stud molecule in brain models, its mechanism debated. Discovery 7,8 as P inhibitor offers mechanistic insights into surrounding 8-mediated effects in the brain.

PL deficiency has been associated with brain disorders for decades, yet causal links unclear. Aside from B administration, pharmacological strategies elevate intracellular levels are lacking. This study identifies 8 as direct P inhibitor that increases PL levels in hippocal neurons, validating as drable to control intracellular levels in the brain. P expression is upregulated in hippoc of middle-aged mice, suggesting supplementation may not suffice elevate intracellular levels where is hyperactive. Discovery 8 as direct P was unexpected. Identification as P inhibitor indicates may modulate B-dependent processes and could be explored as entry into disorders.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the development of the gonad requires the production of diverse cell types and their migration, but the coordination of these processes remains poorly understood. The gonad exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip (DTC) cells, which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z1 and Z4. The polarity of Z1 and Z4, with mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins C-1, C-2, and EGL-20. In LIN-17 mutants, C-2 promotes normal polarity in Z1 and Z, while C-1 promotes normal polarity in Z1 and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits polarization of Z1 and Z. In LIN-egl-20-C-2 mutants, polarity of Z1 is reversed, leading to frequent mismigration of DTC from Z to the posterior. Further analysis demonstrates that mispositioning of DTC in the gon due to polarity reversal of Z leads to mismigration. Similar mismigration is also observed in C-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic DTC. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating production and migration of DTC to establish mirror-symmetric organ.
Researchers have been exploring the concept of multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance, where resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, questions remain about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically whether mutants that provide resistance to a drug suffer similar tradeoffs. To address this, experiments were performed to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells an advantage against fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. Fitness was quantified for 774 mutants across 12 environments, grouping them into classes with characteristic tradeoffs. Unique tradeoffs imply each group affects fitness through different mechanisms. Some groupings were surprising, such as mutants that resist single drugs but not combinations, and mutants of the same gene have different tradeoffs. These findings demonstrate difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments, but also empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants with similar trade, the number of unique drug-resistant mutants was reduced from 774 to a manageable six for investigating molecular mechanisms.

A high-throughput evolutionary approach was used to enumerate classes of drug-resistant mutants and their tradeoffs. A collection of 774 yeast lineages showed at least 6 groups with fitness tradeoffs across 12 environments. The goal was to count types of adaptive mutations, each defined by unique trade, in a drug-resistant population. This exercise was difficult due to mutations providing strongest advantage dominating evolution. To enhance diversity, multiple evolutions were performed in range of FL concentrations and combinations with a second drug. Lineages with no fitness in conditions were underrepresented in experiments lacking RAD and FL. Mutations providing resistance were not beneficial in environments, shown for 100 line.
A phenomenon known as the "central tendency" or "contraction" bias" has been observed in various species and sensory modalities, where the judgment of magnitude of items in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy of the brain's ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, recency biases such as serial dependence are also observed and thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought. When the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short and long-term biases were reduced. A model was proposed that may be involved in generating the behavior, showing that working memory susceptible to shifting to past experience producing short sensory biases naturally leads to contraction. Errors occurring at the level of trials are from the distribution of stimuli and not due to gradual shift memory toward the mean. Results are consistent with behavioral findings and predictions across different distributions and timings, intervals, as well as dynamics in working areas. A set of human psychophysics experiments validated the model on auditory parametric working task.
Researchers investigated the role of PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and its potential as a target for cancer therapy. They found that PIM is repressed in lung cancer and contributes to chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance. Using human samples and a mouse models, they studied PIM genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer and the efficacy of systemically administered PIM expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPIM) combined with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Results showed that PIM repression in lung cancer involves genetic and epigenetic alterations. NanoIM showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, and antitumor activity, and improved efficacy of PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in remaining mice by triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility class I (MHC) expression, multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR) induction and survival and tumor-related gene expression in cells, enhanced lymphocyte infiltration, turning tumors hot and sensitive to ICs and chemotherapeutic and activated-infiltrating lymphocytes (ILs) unleashed by IC. These studies established a clinically applicable PIM-based therapy for lung and possibly other cancers.
Researchers have developed a system to evaluate the quality of food and adjust feeding behavior in animals in challenging environments. They found that heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli) and low-sugar food triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune response, which encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR (IRE-1/XBP-1) innate (PM-1/p38 MAP) axis, particularly neuronal function, which regulates feeding behaviors. Animals can adapt to low-quality food through sugar supplementation, inhibiting UPR-PM-1 regulated response by increasing vitamin biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of cellular stress pathway as a physiological evaluation system for nutritional deficiencies in food, enhancing survival in environments.

Using a low-quality food assay, researchers elucidated the mechanism of cellular response as a physiological evaluation system. The pathway assesses glucose deficiency in food and vitamin content through UPR innate (PM-1/p38) axis. A physiological mechanism was identified that recognizes food quality through UPR (IRE-1/XBP) innate (PM-1/p38) regulated stress response in neurons, dictating food selection behaviors. This system is an adaptation for detecting nutritional deficiencies not by the quick nervous system. A limitation is the lack of explanation for HK-E. coli activating UPR and immunity, hypothesized to be due to altered metabolites.

The innate pathway, mediated by PM-1/p38, plays a role in evaluating unfavorable sources, such as HK. coli, Staphylococcus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, helping animals avoid environments. Nutrients sensed by the X-PM-1 axis for quality evaluation were investigated. Animals may assess quality through UPR and innate pathways. Activation of UPR by HK-E coli was dependent on UPR components, including IREBP, PER, and ATF.
Researchers have investigated the role of carbohydrates in modulating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically targeting the P2 purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a receptor involved in inflammation and immune responses. Using molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies, they identified a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar binding site on P2 and found that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging transmembrane helices 2 and 7. A conserved salt-bridging chain (K2.60-D.64-K7.35-E.36) was identified, distinguishing UDP-sugars including UDP-glucose, UDPgalactose, UDPgluronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucamine. This chain was found to be a conserved motif for sugar binding in both P2 and P purinoceptor 12 (P2). Three sugar nucleotides were designed as agonists for P2, expanding understanding of purergic receptor activation and providing insights for carbohydrate drug development for GPCs.

The ligand models of UDP-sugars were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar site of P. Both P and P were employed to unveil a conserved sugar-binding motif. Multiple carbohydrates were designed and validated as agonists targeting the conserved motif. P purceptor 14 is a model for carbohydrate modulation of GPC, belonging to the purino subfamily responding to nucleotides, including adenosiphosphate (ADP) and UDP. Unlike other purceptors, P is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, UDP-sug. The arrangements of UDPugar sites between P and sugarases might determine selectivity. A cons carbohydrate motif was revealed in P and P, extending understanding how carbohydrates regulate GPC. Studies involving other UDPug found interactions with TM7 determinant UDPug potencies.
Researchers investigated the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells, specifically neuroblasts (NB), in Drosophila. They found that glial cells produce ferritin, which cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NB for energy production, essential for self-renewal and proliferation. Knockdown of glial ferritin genes caused energy shortage in NB, downregulating aconase and NAD+ levels, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation of NB mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. Ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. The level of glial ferr production is affected by the status of NB, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. The study demonstrates that glial cells are indispensable for maintaining self-renew of NB, unveiling a novel role of the glial niche during brain development.

To investigate iron homeostasis in Doph CNS, researchers knocked down genes involved in transport, storage, and regulation in NB, neurons, and glial cells. Only glial knockdown of ferritin genes led to loss and defective brain development. Ferritin in glial cells is crucial for regulating NB behavior and larval development. In proliferative NB receive iron from glial via ferr to fulfill energy requirements for proliferation and selfnew. Iron required by NB is stored in ferritin glial cells and allocated as needed. Bicellular homeostasis makes glial the pool for ferr production, relieving NB from producing ferr and transferring risk of iron-induced oxidative stress to glial cells. Glial clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring NB normal function during development.

The size of tumors was strikingly decreased in larval brains lacking glial ferr. This suggests glial ferr is required for tumor development, a potential target for treatment. To verify iron involved in tumor suppression by glial ferr, iron levels were decreased by adding chelator B in Doph food.
Researchers investigated the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 in the US population during the pandemic. They analyzed multiple cause of death (MC) data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease to account for potential changes in coding practices. Cancer mortality rose by 3% over the pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to 13,600 excess deaths. Mortality was higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological) than poor survival cancers (lung, pancreatic). In contrast, diabetes and Alzheimer's deaths increased by 37% and 19, respectively. The study simulated excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition. Observed differences were primarily explained by life expectancy, with risk of death from deadly cancers competing with COVID-19 risk. 

The study considered death certificates listing cancer as the underlying cause (UC) or anywhere on the certificate (MC). Unlike previous studies, the lack of excess cancer mortality reflects competing risk from cancer, especially deadly types, rather than protection from immunosup. Six cancer types showed modest mortality elevation during the pandemic. Results highlight the importance of MC-records to reflect coding changes with a new pathogen emergence. Diabetes and Alzheimer served as controls, illustrating associations between conditions and COVID-19 in population mortality. Diabetes was a useful comparator due to similar age-at-death and few nursing home residents. Cancer mortality was driven by population size and age with cancer, and life expectancy under diagnosis. The same applied to diabetes and Alzheimer.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops (RNA-DNA hybrids) from eukaryotic genomes. R-loops are formed during transcription and can be toxic to cells, but the mechanisms for their removal were not well understood. The study found that Smc/6 binds to RNA-DNA structures and promotes their degradation by the RNase2 enzyme. Yeast mutants lacking Sm/6 and RN2 accumulate high levels of R-lo in their chromosomes, showing synthetic lethality. The Sm/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrids in vivo and stimulates RN2 degradation in vitro. R-lo are frequently found at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. The Sm/6 complex is involved in repair of unscheduled R-lo generated by various genomic transactions. It binds to R structures formed during transcription and promotes RN2-mediated degradation of the RNA component. Defects in Sm6 and RN2 are linked to R accumulation in chromosomes. The Sm/ complex acts in two ways: within and between pathways in response to R formation. It contributes to RNase-dependent removal of RNA-D hybrids from DNA, but its role is not as extensive as RN enzymes.
Researchers investigated whether age-related decline in sensory acuity can be compensated by preserved attentional neural filtering in older adults. They analyzed electroencephal and behavioral data from 105 individuals aged 39-82 and found that listening performance remained stable over 2 years despite expected decline in sensory acuity. However, neural filtering and behavior were only correlated within each measurement time point, not longitudinally. This suggests that attentional filtering may not be a stable predictor of individual change in listening behavior. 

The study aimed to replicate previous findings and test the relationship between neural filtering and behavior across time, expecting filtering to impact performance independently of age and hearing status. Despite strong correlation between age and acuity, no predictive role of filtering was found in the longitudinal sample. 

Hearing acuity, filtering, and listening performance were analyzed across the middle to older lifespan, and change from time 1 to 2. Linear mixed models tested cross-sectional age effects and longitudinal changes, and test-retest reliability was quantified. No systematic change in filtering was expected due to interindividual differences being independent of age and hearing. Longitudinal stability of the age and hearing-independent effect of filtering on accuracy and response was tested. 

Behavioral outcome of interest was speed and accuracy in solving difficult listening situations, involving perceptual and cognitive processes. Attentional filtering was a neurobiological candidate to explain interindividual differences and lifespan trajectories.
Researchers investigated the role of chemosensation, the combination of taste and smell, in the use of botanical drugs in ancient Greece and Rome. They analyzed data from a tasting panel and applied phylogenetic general linear models to determine if intensity and complexity of chemosens qualities, as well as tastes and flavors, predicted therapeutic uses of drugs. The study found chemensation to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use, with drugs having high versatility having simple tastes and intense flavors, and 21-22 chemens qualities predicting at least one therapeutic use. In addition to bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy flavors were associated with versatility. The study suggests that ancient uses of drugs were based on physiological effects consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste pharmacology, contradicting the theory of imbalance of bodily humors. The researchers propose that chemensation and physiological effects mediated by chemhesis and taste pharmacology explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of drugs in ancient times.
Researchers have identified that certain bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Escherichia, and Citrobacter koser, are attracted to human serum, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia and sepsis, a leading to death in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. They used an injection-based microfluidics device to simulate GI bleeding and found that femtol volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to serum. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and chemoattract L-ser, an amino acid abundant in serum recognized by the chemoreceptor T. The researchers report the first structures of Salmonella Typhurium T in complex with L-ser and identify a conserved amino recognition motif for L-ser among T orthologs. They find T to be conserved among Enteracteraceae and numerous World Health Organization pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. They also found that Enteracter use serum as a source of nutrients for growth and chemaxis and chemore T provide a competitive advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions. This behavior is defined as "bacterial vampirism" and may relate to the proclivity of Enteracter for bloodstream infections.
Researchers have identified a conserved genetic program that defines the identity of male cells across animal species, which has been retained over 600 million years of evolution. This program consists of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, with a third being deeply conserved and retained throughout evolution. A set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene regulators represents a core component of the conserved program of metazoan spermatogenesis. Interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male cell identity uncovered 161 previously unknown sperogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility. The study emphasizes the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease and establishes a cross-species analytical pipeline for other cell and pathologies.

The conserved male cell expression program is built around a small network of deeply conserved interactions with an overarching impact. Despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ with new genes, conserved genes remain central in the germ cell transcriptome of distant species. An increased connectivity was explored to gain insight into the conserved basis of metazo sperogenesis. Both vertebrates and invertebrates have an old germ transcript origin tempered by increased expression of younger genes at developmental stages. Data indicates a sperogenic program spanning 600 years, expanding previous observations in the mammalian lineage.

The study proposes that despite rapid evolution of reproductive genes, the basis of metazo male cell relies on an conserved program providing insight into sperogenesis and human infertility. An interdisciplinary platform was devised combining four approaches to test this hypothesis.
Researchers studied the coordination of flagellar beating in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model organism for flagellate motility, and found that each flagellum plays a distinct role in synchronous beating. They used a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum and showed that beating responds only to load exerted on cisellum, and asymmetry in response derives from unilateral coupling between flagella. This highlights a distinct role for each flagum in coordination and has implications for biflagellate's tactic behaviors. Dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating is the basis of C. reinhardt's motility, with calcium involved in switching beating mode. The flagella have differential roles in coordination and are coupled to external flow through cis. A stochastic model was developed to elucidate mechanisms of asymmetry, with selective loading and dominance represented by ϵ≠ϵ and λ≠λ. Intriguingly, connected flagella adopt kinematics of cis-eyes flagum when beating synchronously, leading to assumption of differential roles in coordination. The hypothesis was tested by oscillatory flows applied from angle to cells' axis, exerting biased loads on flagum. A model was used to express ε as function of fc, t, ϵ, t, λ, and λ, illustrating flag dominance and loading effects on coordinated beating. Monte-Carlo simulations clarified interplay between flows and flagella, reproducing experimental observations.
Researchers investigated the mechanism behind the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting and found that it promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), which leads to the browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of IL3 cells increased the browning of white adipose in diet-induced obese mice, and exogenous IL-22 also increased the browning of subcutaneous whiteose. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor (IL-22) attenuated the browning induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of intestinal cells revealed that fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon signaling in IL3. Analysis of cell-cell receptor interactions indicated that fasting stimulated IL3 with dendritic and macrophages. These results establish the role of IL3 in browning of adipose, suggesting the IL3/IL-22/IL-22 axis contributes to metabolic benefits of fasting.
Researchers investigated the role of associative and non-associative mechanisms in defensive behavior using a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm in mice. They paired a compound stimulus (CS) consisting of a tone and white noise (WN) with footshock, and compared it with control groups that received pseudorandom or unpaired presentations of CS and footock, or reversed CS with inverted tone-WN order. On day 1, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during tone and explosive jumping during WN, while unpaired and reverse groups showed less tone-induced freezing and rare jumping. During extinction, the paired group's tone-induced freezing decreased and shifted to a combination of freezing and jumping, while unpaired, unpaired, and shock groups displayed tail rattling and darting with minimal freezing and jumping. The paired reverse group did not jump to WN and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote responsiveness, but associative factors are required for cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. The study highlights the need to elucidate associative and nonassoci elements of Pavlov fear conditioning that influence defensive behavior.
Researchers investigated whether the sinusoidal encoding of head direction in insects is an evolutionary coincidence or offers a functional advantage. They established the mathematical requirements for direction encoding and showed that it can be performed by various circuits with different activity patterns. Among these patterns, the sinusoidal one is the most resilient when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. The predicted connectivity pattern agrees with anatomical data from the locust and fruit fly. The circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying neural connectivity doesn't need to be explicitly encoded in the insect's genetic program but can develop during development. The eight-column organisation of head circuits across multiple species is not a chance but explained by basic principles.

The integrating neurons in insects have sinusoidal patterns (Wittmann and Schler, 1995; Vicker and Paolo,200; Stone et al,2017). Electrophys and imaging show population encoding direction has sinus-shaped activation (Lab,198; Lab,200; Lo and Hom,200; Pfe et,200; Pfe and Hom,200; Kin,200; Hein,200; Hom,201; El,201; El,201). Heading circuits have been studied with models ranging from conceptual (Witt and Schler,199; C et,201) to sophisticated featuring multiple types (K and Bort,201; et, Kim,201; Pis,202; Ly,202).

Previous work argued sinus encoding facilitates vector addition (Witt and Schler,199). However, this is not the only reason as a family of circuits enable easy addition. The predicted circuit agrees with locust and fly data using analysis. Hebb learning is sufficient for development.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimer mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Park-mediated ubiquitination. Researchers discovered a heightened propensity of CIS1 to form dimers in PINK mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PD patients with PINK mutations. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide. In this conformation CIS1 cannot coordinate the ironulf cofactor. Overexpressing CISD, the Drosophila ortholog of CIS1, and a mutant CIS incapable of binding the ironulf cluster in Drosila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with CIS and PINK mutant flies. Complete loss of CIS, in contrast, rescued detrimental effects of PINK mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial structure. Results suggest CIS, ironpleted CIS, operates downstream of PINK, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as a therapeutic target.

The study identified CIS1, its ironpleted form, as a downstream mediator of pathophys effects from PINK loss in flies and humans, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as a therapeutic protein. CIS1 is involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics, quality control, iron metabolism, and oxidative defense against distress, hallmarks of PD. The study used fly and mammalian models to investigate CIS1's role in PD, identifying CIS, particularly itspleted form, as a mediator of PD induced by PINK and Park loss function. Immunlot revealed increased dimer and presence of CIS under conditions. Increased dimer in P neurons likely represents presence of CIS, a form devoid of ironulf cluster, caused by changes in homeostasis. CIS overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted morphology, and accumulation of phosphubitin blocking mitagy, resulting in accumulation of defective mitochondria.
A study investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54 produced by the parasitic phytoplas in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP is responsible for inducing leaf-like flowers in phytopma-infected plants, but previous research showed that insects were attracted to leaves and flowers were not required. This study found that exposure to leafhopper males is necessary for the attraction, suggesting a response that distinguishes leafopper sex in the presence of SAP. In contrast, phytopma effector alongside leafopper discourages female colonization. SAP suppresses biotic stress pathways in leaves exposed to males. The host MADS transcription factor vegetative phase (SVP) emerges as key in female leafopper preference for exposed plants to SAP, with SAP promoting degradation of S. Preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed sv null plants over not exposed. The research highlights the dual role of phytopma effector SAP in host alteration and vector attraction integral to phytoplasm life. SAP acts as a molecular'matchmaker', helping leafoppers locate mates by degrading S-containing leaves. This study provides insights into parasite genes extended phenotypes and plant-insect interactions. 

The study expands understanding of insect-specific factors targeted by parasites, uncovering a mechanism where phytopma effector SAP targets conserved regulator S to attract leafoppers to produce progeny on exposed to males. Leafoppers prefer SAP and sv mutant plants in presence of males, underscoring regulatory effect of S and other MADS factors by SAP on responses to herbore sexes. The interaction is detailed in proposed Figure 7. Phytopmas can modify volatile production (Mayer et al, 2022). Given SAP promotes fecundity of A-W phytopma leafopper M quadratus, this study investigates insect-plant affected by SAP. Females feed, males feed, and plants induce defence to feeding and laying (Little et al, 2007). SAP exposed males display downregulation biotic responses. Identified MADS factor SVP essential for female preference male-exposed SAP. Leafopper exhibit preference reproducing sv null, contingent presence males, aligning SAP mediates degradation S. Phytopmas rely leafoppers for feeding transmission, SAP likely promotes abundance and facilitates transmission.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and has a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, in part, because C. alb can initiate a drug tolerance response, allowing some cells to grow at drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration. To characterize this cytoprotective tolerance at the single-cell level, a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics was used to profile thousands of fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antif drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression correlating with cell stage, distinct and metabolic stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, a time tolerance measurable, cells bifurcate into two subpopulations: one by upregulating genes encoding ribosomal, RNA machinery, and mitochondrial capacity, termed Ribo-domin (Rd); the other enriched for stress and processes, termed Stressomin (S). This bifcation persists 3 and 6 post-treatment. The ribosome stress response (RR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate survival.

A nanol droplet-based transcriptomics was used to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in C. alb response to antif drugs. The transcriptomes of thousands of cells were profiled from C. alb populations either untreated or exposed to antif compounds with focus on fluconazole (FC) across several days. Two high-throughput fungalome studies profiled ~40K cells. A preliminary study profiled C. alb using a nanol droplet-based assay (DROPq), modified from the system presented. The use of nanol droplet assay for fungal enabled detailed analysis C alb in absence and presence antif drugs over days. The assay was cost-effective and minimal issues encountered. Studies thousands cells enriched understanding community and heterogeneity. Results align reports associate cell phase with expression and metabolism-related genes. The C alb response to antif compounds was investigated using fungatic FC (1g/ml, MIC). The mechanisms differ from bacterial heteristance, small exhibits growth in drugs. This study focuses antif tolerance FC, a fungatic drug. Previous characterized aspects tolerance C alb.
Researchers have proposed a new metric, the Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), to measure the effectiveness of selection in species by correcting for confounding factors such as GC content and amino acid composition. The CAIS is based on the Kull-Leibler divergence and can be calculated from a complete genome without polymorphism or mutation rate data, reference genes, or demographic history. Codon bias varies quantitatively within a small range, so measuring the proportion of sites with effective cod adaptation is a promising. Highly adapted species have a higher proportion of genes and sites subject to effective cod bias. Cod adaptation metrics directly quantify species variation in adaptation, unlike effective size estimates based on polymorphism. CA and ENC can be estimated for more species as they don't require polym or mutation data, tRNA copy numbers, but a single genome. CA has the advantage of not being confounded with amino frequencies.

A new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level was developed, quantifying degrees of adaptation among vertebrates. Vertebrates were chosen due to data abundance and as a test case, given limited evidence for cod adaptation. The degree of bias in synonymous usage driven by preference offers a direct assessment of selection at the molecular level. It can be estimated from a single genome without polym or mutation data. The Codon Adaptation Index (CA) is a commonly used metric, quantifying cod adaptation (Sharp and Li, 1987).
Severe sepsis causes millions of deaths worldwide and is a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization. Sepsis-related deaths result from dysregulated immune responses, highlighting the need for strategies to target inflammation. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is an important mediator of inflammation, released by inflamed host cells and bacteria in a strain-dependent manner. This study investigated mechanisms of bacterial ATP release using Escherichia coli (E. coli) mutants, demonstrating that ATP release is dependent on inner membrane ATPase and outer membrane integrity. In a mouse model of abdominal seps, effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using transformed E. coli with arabin-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abating bacterial release shows ATP suppresses local immune responses, reducing neutrophil counts and survival. Additionally, ATP has systemic effects via outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OM are distributed throughout the body, upregulating genes degranulation in neutils, exacerbating seps severity.

E. coli, a frequent pathogen in abdominal seps, released highest ATP in a mouse model. Demonstrating seps-associated ATP release, the study questioned how release is dependent on ATP generation. Release is dependent on ATP, with no differences in bacterial counts observed. ATP by bacteria suppresses abdominal responses and worsens survival in seps model. ATP is metabolized in extracellular space, limiting action to immediate vicinity. However, role of ATP in non-colon compartments, such as abdominal cavity or blood, in local and systemic infections is unknown. This study investigated if released ATP influences seps outcome. Isolated seis bacteria and measured ATP release. E. coli released more ATP compared to E. faalis and S. aureus. Species differed in sequences, confirming release is strain-specific. Seps-associated release ATP in growth and strain-dependent manner.

Bacteria release ATP into extracellular space, a conserved mechanism from host defense and preced responses. Release shown for various bacteria, including seis E. coli, Klei pneumonia, E. faalis, and S aureus.
A large-scale longitudinal study of 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study examined the relationship between genetic and environmental factors, such as familial and neighborhood environment, with cognitive abilities and psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in children. The study found that lower intelligence and higher PLE are associated with lower polygenic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower socioeconomic status, neighborhood, and less supportive environments. Cognitive mediates the effects of these factors on PLE, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact in reducing PLE. The study highlights the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLE through their effects on intelligence, suggesting that improving school and family environments and promoting economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children. 

The study employed linear models and structural equation modeling to examine the trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLE mediated by intelligence, investigating the mediating role of cognitive within impacts of phenotype, family, neighborhood, and school environments on PLE. Results showed higher polygenic scores for cognitive phenotypes correlated with higher intelligence, and lower socioeconomic status with lower PLE. Effects of gene-environment interactions on intelligence and PLE were also tested, adjusting for schizophrenia polygenic scores given association with cognitive deficit in psychosis and at-risk individuals. The study advances by demonstrating integrated effects of genetic and environmental on PLE through intelligence in 9-11-year-old children.
Researchers used human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiP)-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro model to investigate the effects of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling on neural development. They found that F8 treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, leading to the formation of distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic domains in multi-regional organoids. Within telencealic regions, F8 affected anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous network activity. F8 also modulated key regulators of several neurodevelopmental disorders. Transcriptomic analysis revealed F8 induction of ventral telph genes, suggesting a primary role in promoting ventral identity. Upregulation of ventral genes such as ASCL, DLX, and PBX and downregulation of dorsal genes like EM, NEUO, SOX, and LHX were observed. F8 treatment resulted in altered regional identities in 3D organoids compared to controls, with development of multiional organoids with coing brain domains.8 efficiently modulated NR2 and genes associated with brain disorders in FOX1 telph cells, underscoring its role in fine-tuning neurodevelopment and pathogenic pathways. F8-dependent modulation of key genes guided developmental trajectories of brain along D and A telph axes. The ability of F8 to modulate targets varied based on regional identity of F-exposed cells, with coence of various domains in F-treated organ - dorsal and ventral tel, as well as dience and mesph regions.
Researchers have investigated the development of circadian rhythms in Drosila larvae, specifically focusing on the emergence of sleep and feeding patterns during early life stages. In contrast to adult Dila, which exhibit consolidated sleep at night and feeding during the day, larvae do not display daily rhythms until the 3rd instar stage (L3). The study found that 2nd instar (L) larvae sleep and feeding behaviors are scattered throughout the day, becoming organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar stage (L). Disrupting 3 instar larvae to adopt 2nd stage feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and long-term memory (LTM) capabilities. The development of the clock circuit is influenced by larval nutritional environment, and Dh44 neurons act through glucose genes to drive daily sleepake rhythms. The research suggests that changes in energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of circadian circuits and behaviors. 

In Dila, Dh neurons act as nutrient sensors, regulating food and starvation-induced sleep through glucose and amino acid genes. In adult Dila, sleep and feeding are consolidated to specific times, with eating more during the day than night. Early in development, 2 inst Dila larvae lack circadian patterns. The emergence of daily sleepake is regulated by changes in energetic capacity, with Dh44 necessary for sensing larval environments. Dh neurons anatomically and functionally connect to Dh output, driving sleep consolidation in 3. Development of this circuit promotes deeper sleep, resulting in LTM capabilities at 3 but not before. The study identifies cues triggering the DN-Dh circuit and sleepake in Dila.
Researchers studied the energy expenditure of fish when swimming alone and in schools to understand how group movement can be more energy-efficient than individual movement. They measured the aerobic and anaerobic energy of giant danio fish swimming at various speeds and found that schools have a concave-shaped metabolism-speed curve with a minimum cost at 1 body length per second. Schools reduced total energy expenditure per beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When swimming at maximum speed, fish in schools had 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% less anaerobic energy, lowering total expenditure and transport cost by 53%. Schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. Anaerobic savings at high speeds improve peak and repeated performance, beneficial for evading predators. These savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated locomotion in fishes.

Fish swimming in viscous water serves as a model for group movement efficiency. Schools increase aerobic performance, save anaobic energy, and reduce recovery time after swimming. It's hypothesized that energy conservation in air or water resistance should be higher at speeds. Fish can reduce high-speed locomotion cost relative to solitary, reducing anaobic costs and recovery time for speeds occupying majority of aerobic capacity. The objective was to determine differences between swimming curves of solitary and schools. Aerobic and anaobic energy were measured over 0-8 body lengths per second and compared to solitary performance.

Both fish and schools have a concave shaped aerobic rate-speed curve over lower speeds. Aerobic cost at 0-3 showed no difference between solitary and schools. Schools at 1 consume less energy at slower speeds.
Researchers investigated the role of macrophages in the lung, specifically airway macrophages (AM), in preventing infection and their potential as a target for therapy. Macrophage functions are associated with cellular metabolism, but there is a gap in understanding of metabolic programming and plasticity of human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. The study examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in their resting state and after priming with IF-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macroages, regardless of origin, had a strong glycolysis response to IF-γ stimulation. IFγ significantly enhanced energetics in both AM and M by upregulating glycol and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike M which shifted to 'Warburg-like metabolism. IFγ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycol with 2-deglucose reduced IFγ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating IFγ induces plasticity in human AM mechanistically mediated by glycol. Direct comparison between macroages, AM were more responsive to IFγ priming and dependent gly for cytok secretion than M. Interestingly, TN production was under control of gly in AM and not MDM. M exhibited glycol-dependent upregulation HLA-DR and CD40 whereas IFγ upregulated HLA and CD on AM independently of gly. Data indicate human AM functionally respond to IFγ in distinct from MDM, providing evidence that AM are tractable for inhalable immunomulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.
Researchers have demonstrated for the first time that nocturnal ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon for navigation. The moon can provide directional information despite being hidden by clouds, canopy, or the horizon, through the polarized light it produces. The sun produces polarized light across the sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarized light is a known cue for navigating animals. Moonlight produces an analogous pattern, a million times dimmer than sunlight. The study shows that polar moonlight is part of the compass for nocturnal ants. Nocturnal ants leave their nest at twilight and rely on the solar polar pattern to navigate. However, foragers return home when the sun cannot guide them. The ants use polar moonlight to navigate during the night by rotating the overhead pattern, altering their headings in response. They can detect this cue throughout the lunar, even crescent moons when polar light is lowest. The study also shows the incorporation of moonlight into the ants' path system throughout the night, as sunlight is incorporated during the day.

The study focused on nocturnal ants, specifically Myrmecia ants, which restrict navigation to evening and morning. These ants use the solar polar pattern to derive information, visible during twilight. The ability to detect polar moonlight is theorized in nocturnal insects, including bees and crickets. However, there is no evidence of its use in goal-directed navigation. The study aimed to find evidence in nocturnal ants. Comparing solar and moon polar navigation in ants, similarities occur in homing to the nest. The ants use polar moonlight the same way they use sunlight, indicating it is integrated into the path integrator. Polar moonlight is processed through the same pathways as sunlight, meaning ants use the same architecture for both cues.
Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial in early pter flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and absent in birds and bats. Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-link lattice within the vanes of early pter. The lattice supported a sophisticated tension system to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the tail to augment control and v function as a structure.

Early pterosaurs, non-pteractloids, had long, stiff tails with mobile bases similar to some dinosaurs like Velocaptor. Many tails ended in soft tissue vane, which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. The stiffening of tails suggests they were important for early p control of mass or shifting inertial control, as in terrestrial theropods with convergent tails. Dynamic control could improve maneuverability and stability, but v fluttering would be destabilizing unless v was tensioned under aerodynamic load.

Over 100 pter fossils were examined for well-preserved vanes using ultraviolet. Four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laser-St Fluorescence. Three exhibited vanes under light, but one was only visible under SF. Researchers investigated the van's properties, usage, origins, and disappearance in later pteractloids.
This study investigated the changes in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core of adolescent and adult male rats using fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis. The results showed baseline differences in dopamine release between adolescent and adult rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) on dopamine release. The α-selective blocker α-conotoxin increased dopamine release in adolescent rats but decreased release in adult rats. Blockade of GABA and GAB receptors revealed that α-mediated increase in adolescent release requires N GABA signaling. In vivo microdial confirmed the role of αA and G in mediating this effect. The study suggests a multisynaptic mechanism unique to the period of development involving acetylcholine at α-containing A to drive inhibitory GABA on dopamine release. This is driven by multisyn regulation of dopamine through acetyl acting α-containing A and GABA in adolescent rats. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence, and previous research found that antagonizing GAB increased release when β-containing A were antagonized, indicating a complex and potentially age-dependent regulation. The study found stimulated release decreased in N core of adolescent rats. Microdial in awake confirmed age differences mediated by G mechanism involving α-containing A in vivo. The responsible for regulating release in adolescent and adult remains unclear.
Researchers investigated the underlying mechanisms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by studying individuals with two distinct subtypes: idiopathic and 16p.2 deletion. Using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), they found that both subtypes had reduced neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration, despite no genetic overlap in their genomes. An unbiased phospho-proteome screen identified hundreds of shared peptides, including the mTOR pathway, which was confirmed in NPCs across both subtypes. mTOR modulation rescued autism phenotypes and reproduced NPC phenotypes in controls. The study suggests that distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration driven by shared pathogenic mTOR signaling dysregulation.

The researchers also found enrichment of ERK/MAP and PK pathways and altered cellular signaling in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The study indicates that NPCs have dysregulated mTOR and mTOR dysregulation drives autism-associated phenotypes. They used iPSC-derived NPCs from two autism subtypes to study neurite development and migration, demonstrating convergence in phenotypes despite whole genome sequencing showing no genetic overlap. The most striking finding is consistent mTOR differences across genetically distinct autism groups, not previously described. Gain and loss function studies showed that increasing mTOR activity rescues ASD defects, while reducing mTOR activity reproduces autism phenotypes. Increasing mTOR in low-TOR patients rescued ASD phenotypes, and decreasing mTOR in high-TOR did not. The study suggests early dysregulation may be common among multiple forms of ASD, with mTOR as a point of convergence for shared neur and migration phenotypes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the diversity of synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea and the diversity of neural responses to sound. They found that synapses on the pillar side of IHC have higher rates of spontaneous release, larger and more compact spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower thresholds, tighter coupling of calcium channels, and vesicular release sites, and shorter latencies and higher release rates compared to those on the modiolar side. This suggests that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. The study used paired recordings of IHC and SGN boutons in acutely explanted organs of Cort from mice with stimuli mimicking in vivo SGN characterization, controlling IHC calcium influx and recording postsynaptic S response to glutamate at single afferent synapse. The results support the presynaptic hypothesis of SGN diversity and highlight challenges in bridging the gap between presynaptic cell function and neural encoding. Synaptic heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual IHC with 5-30 SGN and is a candidate for cochlea decomposing acoustic information.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Plasmodium falciparum protein, PfORC, in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression throughout the parasite's lifecycle. Using CRISPR/Cas genome editing and molecular approaches, they found that PfOR modulates chromatin structure and heterochrom formation, and is essential for parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (Ch-seq) showed PfOR binds to subtelomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown and chromatin capture studies revealed downregulation of PfOR impairs histone marks and collapses heterochatin structure, leading to parasite death. These findings confirm PfOR plays a crucial role in chromatin and gene regulation, validating it as a candidate for antimalarial strategies.

The genome-wide distribution and function of PfOR throughout the parasite cycle was previously unknown. This study used CRPR/Cas technologies to determine PfOR's function, distribution, and indispensability. Immunoprecitation of an HA-tagged line validated PfOR's role in heterochatin maintenance.

Preliminary studies identified PfOR as one of the most chrom-bound proteins. Given MOR's multifunctional role in apcomplex parasites, PfOR's association with chrom accessibility and stage-specific regulation was assessed using genome-wide PfOR Ch-seq at ring, trophite, and schizont stages. Conflicting results on PfOR's essentiality using KD or KO strategies remained. CR/Cas editing determined PfOR's localization, genome-wide distribution, and impacts on chrom, transcript, and cell development.

Pfurther evidence shows PfOR is critical for cell progression and survival, with a direct role in heterochatin and gene silencing, regulating immune evasion through antigen variation. Disparities in PfOR's essentiality for survival were observed in previous studies.
Researchers investigated the impact of tumor-infiltrating nerves on mental health changes in cancer patients, using a mouse model of head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing. They found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas and activate neuronal circuitry, leading to altered behaviors such as decreased nesting, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltr nocicept neurons exhibited heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections showed increased Fos and calcium compared to non-tumor counterparts. Elimination of nociceor neurons decreased F expression and mitigated behavioral alterations induced by tumor presence. Analesic treatment restored nesting and cookie behaviors, but not wheel running, indicating pain is not exclusive driver of behavioral shifts. The interaction between tumor-infiltr nerves and brain is crucial for developing interventions alleviating mental burdens associated with cancer.

Tumor-infiltr nerves communicate signals to brain leading to cancer changes in behavior, independently of pain. Elimination of TR1-expressing nocor neurons reduces tumor growth and survival, highlighting a therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. Absence of nocor neurons in tumor animals decreased F and F in P, and F in Sp. Other regions were not impacted. Disruption of tumor-brain communication in absence nocor evaluated effects on cancer-induced changes through nesting behavior. Animals' well-being was assessed through nesting behavior. Findings demonstrate tumor-infiltr nerves integrated pre-established circuit from tumor to T ganglion, to Spc, and brain, influencing pain-dependent and independent ways.

Cancer patients and survivors experienced poor mental health. Neural connection tumor and brain, with altered TR1-expressing nocor neurons within circuit, might contribute changes.
Researchers have analyzed the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact on the biophysical properties of the multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. They found that variations in the physicochemical parameters of its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) allow for plasticity but also impose functional constraints similar to those in coronaviruses. Experiments with N-protein species carrying mutations showed that point mutations in IDRs can have nonlocal effects on thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid separation. In the Omic variant, distant mutations in IDRs have compensatory effects shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein properties and creating a new protein-protein interface. The study suggests that genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in bi characteristics of Nprotein species, particularly in IDRs.

The researchers computationally evaluated the range of biophysical traits from SARSV-2 Nprotein domains and IDRs across mutants and related coronaviruses. The SARS-2 genome presents an opportunity to examine sequence impacts on biophysical properties and constraints for viral viability. Focusing SARS-2 Nprotein, they studied biophysical phenotypes to understand mechanisms of Nprotein functions and biophysical landscape evolution. Experiments with representative mutants from SARS-2 variants characterized variation in thermodynamic, secondary, oligom, energetics of binding, and LLPS. A large biophysical space is available for Nprotein with potential for mutations to modulate overall properties.
Researchers investigated how skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency change during hibernation in small and large mammal species to optimize energy utilization. They isolated muscle fibers from hibernating animals, including Ictidomys trcematus, Eliom quinus, Ursus arctos, and Ursus american, and conducted Mant-AT chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure myos dynamics and ATP demand. Proteomics analysis showed preservation of myos structure in U. arct and U. american during hibernation, but changes in myos metabolic states in I. trcematus and E. quinus led to higher energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at 20°C. Loaded-ATP chase experiments at 8°C showed myos ATP consumption in type II fibers reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. My2 hyperphosphorylation in I. trcematus stabilized myos, potentially mitigating myin increases in muscle expenditure during tor in response to cold. Myos is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to changes in skeletal muscle ATP consumption, and altered in response to cold, highlighting myos as a contributor to muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.
Researchers investigated the role of chondrocy columns in bone elongation by analyzing 3D structures of confetti-labeled clones in embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice. Contrary to expectations, chrocytes in the embryonic plate were not arranged in columns, but rather formed elongated clusters perpendicular to the growth direction due to incomplete rotation of the division plane during cell proliferation. In contrast, postnatal plates showed both ordered and disordered columns, as well as small disorganized clusters at the edges. The study suggests that modulation of division plane rotation in proliferating chrocy determines formation of clusters or columns, a multifunctional mechanism regulating morphogenesis throughout pre and postnatal growth. The findings provide new understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying plate activity and elongation during development.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are of great interest in pharmaceuticals due to their promiscuous binding site, which has been linked to improved bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across phylogen kingdoms and function by coupling uptake to the electrochemical gradient. Recent cryo-EM and alpha-fold models have provided insights into conformation states of mammalian POTs SLC15A1 and SLC2. However, these studies leave questions regarding mechanism of proton and coupling, while providing opportunity to investigate using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study employs unbiased enhanced-sampling to map SLC2 conformation cycle and thermodynamic forces. Computing conformation free landscapes in proton states and presence or absence of peptide identify sequence proton steps drive inward-directed access. Simulations identify differences extracellular gate mammalian and bacterial POT, validated in cell transport assays. Results from constant-P MD and absolute free energy (ABE) calculations establish mechanistic link between binding and recognition, revealing details secondary transport POT. This study provides step understanding proton-coupled peptide transport in mammals and integrates knowledge solute biology with drug design to target and bioavailability.

The study utilises bacterial and mammalian structures to construct alternating mechanism. Movement protons drive conformation changes, and conformation-proton events coupled substrate presence. Distinct effects ligand binding conformation changes proton E and E titatable residues. Work provides plausible sequence steps substrate-coupled access mammalian POT. To investigate peptide-proton coupling, simulations included Alahe substrate. Calculated afinity AB in states. Afinity similar OF and IF, indicating substrate alone does not drive OF to IF. Unbiased approach generates hypotheses testing proton-state conformation changes. Enhanced sampling conformation energy landscapes proton and substrate conditions.

POT belong major facilitator superfamily (M) conserved six-helix functional domain N-C termini cytoplasm.
Researchers investigated the neural responses in the auditory cortex during speech production in humans using intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants. They found that the superior temporal gyrus (ST) exhibited suppression of auditory responses during speech, which varied across different locations. A delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task revealed that the suppressed sites also showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. There was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and sensitivity, suggesting that suppression might be a key mechanism underlying speech monitoring. When participants produced speech with simultaneous feedback, posterior ST was selectively activated during the DAF paradigm, indicating increased attentional modulation of auditory sensitivity.

The study aimed to test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback in neurophysiological recordings. Results showed overlapping sites in ST exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to feedback with a strong correlation, supporting the hypothesis that suppression predicts sensitivity to speech errors in humans. Delaying feedback during speech enhanced auditory responses in ST, and the degree of sensitivity varied across recording sites. There was a significant correlation between speech-induced suppression and feedback, providing evidence for a shared mechanism between suppression and speech monitoring.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive census of McBC systems, a type of prokaryotic IV restriction systems, and found them to be abundant and diverse in prokaryotes, with a plethora of genomic associations. They focused on a previously uncharacterized branch, Coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoNuTs), which feature extensive coiled structures and nucleases. Three types and multiple subtypes of CoNu were discovered, each with distinct domain compositions and genomic associations. CoNu domains interact with translation components, such as OB-fold, Hsp homologs, YTH domains, and RNases, suggesting they target RNA. Some CoNu might target DNA via McC nuclease homologs. CoNu are often encoded in superons with other restriction systems, such as Type I, RM, BRE, and Type III. These superons are regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly RNA fragments with CARF domains. The authors hypothesize CoNu employ a defense strategy similar to Type III CRIS-C systems, eliminating DNA/RNA first, then aborting infection via RNA cleavage.

 CoNu contain domains interacting with translation components, such as SB-like OB-fold, H70 homologs, Y domains, and RNases, suggesting they target RNA. Three types of CoNu were identified, with distinct domain compositions and genomic associations. RNA capability of Type-III and III can be inferred from similarity to Type-A encoding H70 proteins. Higher-order associations of II and III CoNu with DNA systems suggest two-prong DNA/RNA strategy. The authors suspect RNA is an ancestral feature of CoNu. Consistent with this, II and III CoNu likely target RNA, given operons encode HNases, recognizable nuc in these systems. Association of CDC-like ATPases with III CoNu, encoding tmRNA SP domain supports tm interaction. Structural analysis of bacterin protein indicates an inactivated restriction fold, potentially nucleic-binding.
Researchers investigated the role of calcineur, a conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent ser/threonine phosphatase, in regulating innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that calcine is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) and its inhibition leads to intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. Calcine inhibition also mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is required for lifespan mediated by calcine inhibition, and the nuclear receptor NHR-8 is upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. Studies uncover a role for calcine in C. elegans DMP and provide a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity.

 Calcine regulates diverse cellular processes, including thermaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan in C. elegans. Knockdown of the catalytic subunit, tax-6, enhances lifespan via multiple pathways, including autophagy and CRE-regulated transcriptional coactivators. Calcine activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, activated by binding of calmodulin to calcine. The rhythmic D cycle in C. elegans is regulated by calcium waves. Calcine, conserved from yeast to humans, is involved in cellular and signal transduction pathways.

Inhibition of calcine is known to enhance C. elegans lifespan through multiple pathways. Researchers examined the effect of calcine inhibition on C. eleg innate immunity and found that knockdown of tax-6 enhances susceptibility to bacterial infection despite lifespan. Tax-6 is required for the rhythmic defation program D. The role of calcine in regulating C. response to pathogen has not been studied due to lack of NF transcription factors. Studies could shed light on interplay between lifespan and immunity.
Researchers investigated how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory or internal representations, and a limited set of cognitive processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a challenge. Based on the cognitive theory, conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can be resolved by a set of control processes along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that conflicts with similar sources are represented similarly in space. A task with five types of conflicts was designed that could be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting space as a principle for representing conflicts.

The study aimed to test the geometry of conflict representation in cognitive space. It was hypothesized that types of conflicts are represented as points in space. Importantly, the distance between points reflects the geometry of space, with difference in sources of conflicts represented by points. Dimensions in space can be domains, which domain-specific control are defined. A type conflict's location in space can be parameter using limited coordinates, reflecting control needed for domain-specific control. Space can represent types with low dimensionality (Bad et al, 2021;Macowell et al,202). Domains can be conjunct in single space to achieve domain control conflicts from sources can resolved using set processes. It was hypothesized that space representing types conflicts may be in frontopetal due its roles in resolution (Freund et,202a; et,2004).

Two solutions resolving conflicts were proposed, differing whether control mechanisms applied domains. Domain-general control posits frontopetal encodes information and flexibly control for types. This supported generalizable adjustment (i.e.
Researchers conducted the largest study to date on the vaginal immune response in pregnant women at risk for preterm birth, collecting vaginal swabs from 739 women across gestation. They analyzed 31 immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides, and found that the vaginal immunopome has a homeostatic profile throughout uncomplicated gestation, but shifts to a pro-inflammatory state in women who experience preterm labor or preterm rupture of membranes. This inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial peptides. The immunome has predictive value over maternal characteristics for identifying women at risk for early preterm birth. The immunome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this are associated with preterm birth. The immunome can be leveraged as a biomarker for early preterm birth, a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.
Researchers have developed a computational model, known as the Hernandez-Hern model, to study the function of smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles, which regulate blood flow and blood pressure. The model is based on experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model suggests fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during myogenic tone development in blood vessels. Although data show KV.5 currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, simulations indicate KV.5 is the dominant current regulating potential in male cells, while female myocytes have larger KV2.1 expression and longer activation time constants. Predictions from female myocytes suggest KV.1 plays a primary role in controlling membrane potential. Over the physiological membrane potential range, a small number of voltage-gated K+ and L-type Ca2 channels drive sex differences in intracellular Ca+ and excitability. The model also shows an ideal computational vessel, female smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to Ca2 blockers compared to male. The Hernandez model presents a framework to investigate sex-specific antihypensive drugs. 

The Hernandez model integrates sex variations in voltage-gated KV channels and predicts KV.1 plays a critical role in controlling female myocytes compared to male. Importantly, the model predicts used antihypensive Ca2 blockers cause larger reductions in Ca2 currents in female than male myocytes. A one-dimensional vessel representation of electrocoupled myocytes in series suggests Ca blockers are more potent in females, resulting in substantial Ca reduction in smooth muscle compared to male. The Hernandez model demonstrates sex differences in Ca2 and KV.
Researchers investigated the relationship between litter decomposition and precipitation, focusing on the varying responses of decomposers of different sizes to moisture levels. They hypothesized that larger decomposers' tolerance to aridity would counterbalance the effect of smaller decompos, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. To test this, they placed litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient and characterized macrocomposer assemblages using pit trapping. Decompos responded differently to precipitation based on size, with microbial decomposition increasing in winter and macrocomposition peaking in arid during summer, resulting in similar rates across the gradient except in hyperid sites. Macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. The study highlights the importance of macrocomposition in aridlands, resolving the dry decomposition conundrum, and emphasizes the need to consider decomposer size when investigating biogeochemical processes.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with a poor prognosis and high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. Activation of the KRAS gene in almost all tumors drives RAC activation, leading to enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropocytosis. Macropocytosis is understood as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its functions in trafficking of signalling. Researchers found that CY-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumors in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cy, the gene encoding CY-B protein, accelerates tumorigenesis, leading to ER and JNK-induced proliferation in precancer lesions, indicating a role as a buffer of RAC activation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CY-B inhibits metastasis. CY-B depleted tumor cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysosphatidic acid, a driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macinocytic uptake of lysosphatid acid receptor. The study implicates CY-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

Deletion of Cy in pancreas, with expression of KR G and p, led to acceleration of Pan formation and increase in pancreas lesions with phospho-ER and phosph-J, two downstream of KR and R that drive proliferation and expansion. CY-B was highly expressed in human cancers and correlated with poorer survival. Increased CY-B in mice suggested this could reveal role in human PDAC. Loss of Cy in model accelerates Pan formation and progression, due to CY-B capacity to buffer R activation of KR to abnormal, combined with hyper of ER and J to proliferation. The model is characterized by metastasis to clinically organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel. CY-B localizes macinos in cancer lines, suggesting mechanism for CY loss to affect progression.
Researchers have identified a clade of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) known as HERV-HML-2, which includes intact or nearly intact proviruses, but no replication-competent H-2 proviruses have been found in humans. However, H-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhes macaques, but the extent and timing of H-2 activity in macques is unclear. A total of 145 H-2-like proviruses were found inhes macques, including a clade ofhes-specific insertions. The age, open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions suggest recent or ongoing activity in macques. One clade of provir is characterized by ~750 sequence between env and 3 long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from recombination with HER-K H-8-related virus. This cl is found in Old World (OW) monkeys but not great apes, indicating it originated after ape/OW split. Similar proviruses were found in white-cheek gibbons, insert cluster within OW recombinant cl, suggesting interspecies transmission from OW to gibbons. The LTR of youngest provir have deletions U3, disrupting Response Element (RE) required for nuclear export unspliced RNA. It is shown that H-8 region functions as Response-independent constitutive transport (CTE), indicating ancestralRE-RE export system replaced by CT mechanism.
Researchers investigated the role of Enterococcus faalis in wound infections, which can lead to delayed or failed healing and significant morbidity. They employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model, examining over 23,000 cells, creating a comprehensive atlas of cellular and transcriptomic landscape. The analysis revealed unique transcription and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating distinct changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal healing. Dysregulation of keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes contributed to an anti-inflammatory environment, with E. faalis prompting premature epithelial-mesymal transition in kerocytes. Additionally, E. fa modulated M2 macrophage polarization, inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and scRNA-seq. Macrophage cstalk with neutrophils regulated chemine signaling, promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. The study provides new insights into immunosuppressive role of E faalis in infections. 

The study found uninf wounds undergo reparative angiogenesis, while E fa infection evoked pathologicalization. Analysis underlined M-like macroage-EC interactions as altered cell signaling during bacteria-infected healing. Persistence of fa-associated virulence factors, immunomodulatory strategies, and implications in delayed healing remain to be investigated. A comprehensive atlas of host response to persistent fa infection was generated, observing fa induces immunosup in kerocytes and fibroblasts, delaying response. Insights from scRNA-seq provide foundation for future studies investigating factors contributing woundogenesis and underlying mechanisms delayed healing. 

The study compared transcript and cellular profiles uninf and fa-infected full-thickness skin at 4 post-infection. However, lacks dataset uninf unwounded skin transcript, investigating changes induced by wounding alone. fa reaffirmed fibro functions during uninf healing, consistent with lig-receptor interactions. Imm cells crucial in healing by eliminating pathogens, kerocyte andro activity, inflammation, and repair.
Researchers used a custom-built high-throughput proton transfer time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) system to study the temporal patterns of volatile responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. They found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles resulted in a clocked response in neighboring plants, characterized by a terpene burst at the onset of the second day. This burst was not explained by terene accumulation during the night, but coincided with jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The burst occurred independently of day-night transitions and could not be fully explained by sender dynamics. Instead, it was the result of stress from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary to bioactive volatiles on the second. The study revealed that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress volatiles resulted in a response that integrated priming and induction into a distinct temporal pattern. This provided an answer to the long-standing question of whether volatiles induce or prime defenses in neighboring plants, revealing they can both in sequence.

Experiments showed the importance of tracking plant responses in real-time as they perceive the dynamic volatile of herboreatt neighbors. The ecological relevance of clocked kinetics of activation in neighboring plants was proposed. Responding strongly to cues on the second may avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. This was the result of volatile priming on the first that yielded a clock response to volat perceived the next. Plants respond to herbore volat by increasing their defenses. Activation can happen directly, increasing hormone production and release. To test this, receiver plants were exposed to volat from control or vol from herbore plants for 1.25 hours, then disconnected and exposed to clean air until the next day. Half were then exposed to H as secondary. H was selected as it showed strongest correlation with measured teres.

The delayed burst may be due to interaction of initial volatile that primes for higher release at onset the second and secondary in form bioactive from sender at onset. Maize exposed to vol from herboreatt start release teres. A time-course analysis of ter release by receiver exposed to sender under Spoptera exigua caterpillars was conducted.
Researchers have investigated the vocalizations of wild orangutans to determine if they exhibit recursive patterns similar to those found in human language and music. They found that male orangutans produce rhythmic sequences within rhythmic sequences, consistent with a hierarchical structure. The lower-level rhythms are not multiples of the higher-level rhythms, indicating that these patterns are not due to parallel processing or physical constraints. This discovery suggests that recursion, a key feature of human language and music, may have originated in proto-musical expression in human ancestors and was later adapted for linguistic use. Further studies on great ape vocalizations could test this idea and provide insights into the evolution of recursion in humans.
A study on the interaction between the MDA receptor and 5'pp-RNA virus in the lower vertebrate Miichthys mii has shed light on the evolutionary arms race between vertebrates and viruses. The loss of RIG in vertebrates led to the search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the main pathway. The study found that MDA, a homolog of R-I, can replace R-I in recognizing 5pp-RNA, leading to redundancy of R-I loss from the species genome during evolution. As an adversarial strategy, 5pp-R virus can utilize m6 methylation to degrade MDA and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion. The study provides a snapshot of the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system.

The study investigated whether MDA, structurally similar to R-I, can substitute R-I in 5pp-R in vertebrates without R-I. The M mii MDA-mediated pathway response to SC virus and double-stranded poly I:C-HM infection was investigated. The immune ability of MDA was linked to the R-I loss event in vertebrates, proposing a straightforward explanation for this event: M gradually acquired functionalities to detect 5pp-RAs, initially recognized by-I. 

The study used teleost Miichys mii and chicken Gallus, vertebrates lacking R-I, and 5pp-R viruses SC and V to investigate strategies between 5-R virus and host. Results showed MDA of Mii and G gallus lacking-I evolved to recognize 5-R. SC virus mainly affects Sinca, a species lacking-I. Viruses coevolve with hosts. Data suggested verte evolved MDA to recognize and resist 5-R in absence-I. SC virus can utilize mA to degrade Mii for evasion. Findings unveil the diversity of antiv activity and a complex race between virus and immunity in vertebrates.
This study investigated the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition, bone density, and turnover in patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for nonmetastatic prostate cancer. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and underwent administration of luteizing hormone-releasing antagonist degare. Body fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM), and bone density (BMD) were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 months of AD. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal peptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH levels and FM in arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FM, fat in arms, and fat trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular mass/LM ratio was observed. This study suggests FSH levels after AD could impact body composition, particularly FM. F could be a marker to monitor risk of sarcopenia and guide clinicians in evaluation of body in PC patients AD.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolem ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SC. Sarcasmicoplasmic ryanine receptor 2 (Ry2) Ca+ release channels, downstream of sarlem ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of Ry2 in the pathophysiology of SC. This study tested the hypothesis that Ry2 inhibition in failing hearts reduces sarcasm Ca+ leak and repolarization, mitigates VT/SC and improves contract function. A guinea pig model replicates clinical aspects of nonchemic HF, such as prolonged QT, high arrhythmic SC, and Ca+ leak via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to drol (DS) or placebo in early HF. VT and SC (primary outcome), ECG heart rate and variability, echocardi left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunisto LV fibrosis, and sarcasm Ry2 oxidation were assessed. DS prevented VT and SC by decreasing repolar and vent arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered heart rate, preserved competency during β-adnergic challenge and improved heart variability and function. Inhibition Ry2 hyperactivity with drol mitigates vicious cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca and ROS-mediated Ry2, reducing repolar and protecting VTSC. Moreover, increase sarcasm Ca+ improves contract function.
Researchers have investigated the role of Smad and Schnur transcription factors in regulating the response of cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF) family, including the conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, in Caenorhabditis elegans. They identified binding sites for Smad and its transcription partner Schnur based on ChIP-seq peaks and expression of nearby genes from RNA-seq analysis of mutants. Smad and Schnur have overlapping and unique target genes, with Smad acting as a transcriptional activator and Schnur targeting both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in Schn partially suppress the body size phenotype of Sm, suggesting some level of antagonism between factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnur function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and endoplasmic retic (ER) secretory pathway, including disulf reductase d-11. The findings indicate Sm and Schnur have complex and regulatory interactions in regulating secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body regulation.
Researchers have identified the embryonic transcription factor DUX as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation, which is aberrantly expressed in a subset of primary tumors. They found that DUX expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX. In a cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients, DUX expression is significantly associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD1 blockade. DUX expression is also a predictor of survival, even accounting for tumor mutational and molecular features, with DUX associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. The study suggests DUX as a biomarker and therapeutic for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.

DUX expression in advanced uroth carcinoma is associated with an immune exclusion phenotype, with higher proportion of DUX+ tumors exhibiting immune-excluded or immune-des phenotype compared to malignancies where DUX is silent. DUX expression is correlated with PD1 levels in tumor and immune compartments, quantified via IHC. DUX is a feature of metastasis and may induce immune evasion. The mechanism governing DUX depression in cancer is unclear, but DUX expression in metastatic is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity, mirroring observations in primary and cancer cell models. DUX expression induces immunosup gene program, consistent with inhibiting JSTAT in primary cancers.

Uroth cancers exhibit highest frequencies of DUX (54% of patients) in metastatic cohorts, suggesting DUX importance in that type. Data demonstrate high DUX expression across metastatic cohorts reflect true DUX expression, not technical biases in formal-fixed tissues. DUX is expressed in primary and metastatic cancers. In uroth cancers, DUX expression consequences were assessed.
A study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agro-pastoral, and smallholder systems. Livestock abortion is a significant issue affecting productivity and public health, with several pathogens associated but limited data on aetiology and impacts. A surveillance platform was established to investigate abortion events reported by farmers and field officers, collecting samples and data on determinants, patterns, and zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated, with attribution achieved in 19.5% of cases. Histopath proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration, while vaginal swabs provided practical material for pathogen detection. The study demonstrated the feasibility of a surveillance system through community-based officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms.

The study showed utility, acceptability, and feasibility of abortion as a syndromic event surveillance and effective reporting system across settings, including rural areas. Findings discussed in relation to establishing a framework for evidence-based interventions to improve development, livelihoods, and health in Africa. Aetiological attribution of abortion rarely exceeds 35% even in well-resourced systems, and is sparse in African systems. A prospective study of aetologies in northern Tanzania found limited information on practices, effectiveness, and challenges/opportunities. Livest has many causes, including infectious, nutritional, physical, and genetic factors. Non-infect conditions, nutritional, metabolic, and toxic are likely causes in Tanzania. The study suggests a role for stressful events, including drought and wild attacks, reported in unattributed cases.
Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases, with nicotine (NIC) being a major constituent of cigarette smoke. This study demonstrates that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator with PDZ motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISC via α-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and protein kinase (PKC) activation, which was not detected in Pan cells. Inhibition of Notch by dibenzine (DB) nullified the effects of NIC on ISC. NIC enhances in vivo formation of tumors from ISC loss of tumor suppressor APC, DB inhibited NIC-induced growth. This study identifies NIC-triggered pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenicity of ISC and suggests DB as a potential therapeutic for treating intestinal tumors.

Findings reveal NIC's pivotal role as a stimulant of cancer cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, explaining colon cancer development in smokers. Development of drugs blocking α-nACh, Hippo-Y/TA, and Not signaling may treat colon cancers. Extrinsic factors, such as NIC, increase cancer risk by promoting cell division. NIC increased ISC abundance and proliferation may explain increased intestinal tumors in smokers. NIC enhances ISC via αACh as well as Hippo-YTA and Not signaling. This is consistent with DB-induced suppression of Hipp-YTA and Not signaling in NIC-treated mice. NIC expands ISC through upregulated αA and formation of Y-Not loop, suggesting factors as therapeutic targets for NIC-induced colon cancer.

In the intestine, Y activation enhances expression of β-caten and transcriptional targets W signaling. This study contributes to knowledge on how cells respond NIC, a component of smoke, and a new strategy for smoking-related colon treatment. NIC affects ISC rather than Pan via Hipp-YTA and Not signaling activated nA by mRNA and sorted ISC or Pan cells ex vivo assays. Crosstalk between Hipp, Not, and regulates mammalian homeostasis
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, stress, and aging, and disease by facilitating protein solubilization and refolding through substrate binding and release, regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). This study elucidates the collaborative impact of Hsp NEFs and different JDP classes on H70-dependent aggregate processing. Results show that Hsp plays a major role in initial stages of disaggregation, determining its efficacy. NE catalyzes the recruitment of H70 onto aggregate surface, modifying aggregates into smaller species readily processed by chaper. Hsp stimulation by H is stronger with class B than A JDP and requires interaction between BDP and H70 EE motif. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that H disrupts J-H70 interaction, destabilizing chone complexes at aggregate surface, improving disaggregation but inhibiting substoichi H optimum. Balanced interplay between coaper and H70 is critical to unlock disaggreg potential.

 Recent studies showed H70 chaper system exhibits different mechanisms with class A and B J coaper (Wysowski et al, 202). To understand interplay within H70 chaper network, how H affects H70 members different J classes. Result substrate activity to H not increase S1-S1 binding aggregates and NE concentration negatively correlated with affinity H70. Larger H70-J assemblies surface dependent S1 and interaction EE modify misfold species amenable disag (Wysowski et al). H-dependent disag is limited initial chaper recruitment and disassembly, not protein folding. Initial H loading correlates remod into smaller species, improving recognition H104 disagase. H may release J, unless tethered via interaction, e.g., other J subunit complex aggregate-bound H70. Fate displaced established, presumably low H levels rebind another site or aggregate-boundaper. Positive H effect on recovery substantially comprises class J. Stimulation occur stages protein starting association, polype disentlement, final folding.
Researchers have explored the use of wearable digital insoles to analyze gait in individuals with osteoarthritis (OA), a musculoskeletal condition that impairs gait. Traditional gait analysis relies on visual observation, but is subjective and not feasible in clinical settings due to equipment and staff requirements. The study demonstrates that digital insole-measured osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures are comparable to clinical gait standards. A machine learning model was trained on force plate data from participants with OA and controls, achieving high accuracy in predicting force data from a separate validation set (AUROC=0.86, AUPR=0.90) and an independent insole dataset (AU=0.83,AR=0.86). The model was then used to identify individuals by their gait characteristics using single stride raw sensor data. This work provides a framework for alternative to traditional gait methods, adds to wearable technology pipelines, and supports at-home assessments, potentially improving ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.

The study aimed to quantify force data's ability to identify disease-specific gait and if insoles can detect characterizations. Controls and OA were differentiated using vertical force data, dividing the dataset into training (85%) and test (15%) and training a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict classes. A novel framework was developed to apply digital insoles to detect OA status using gold-standard force data, and processed insole-derived outcomes to identify disease patterns. Clinical application of digitalsoles for g analysis in OA is limited by lack of validation, including comparison to laboratory references. The insole SVM model performed similarly on insole (left:AU=0.93,AR=0.94; right:AU=0.93,AR=0.94) as on hold-out force data. Digital insoles can derive more variables, enabling comprehensive assessment. The model was applied to an independent dataset, assuming OA and injury represented similarly, achieving AU=0.83,AR=0.86.
Researchers have developed a non-opioid therapy for post-surgical pain using a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, Clarix (FLO), which attenuates established post-surgical hypersensitivity without opioid side effects in mice. This effect is achieved through direct inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DR) neurons via CD44 pathways. The major component, heavy-hyaluronic acid/paxin 3 (HA/PT3), was purified from AM with higher purity and solubility than LO, replicating LO-induced pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HA/3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements inhibit sodium and high-voltage activated current in nocice DR neurons, making it a key component mediating pain relief. The study highlights the potential of naturally derived biologics from human tissues as non-opoid treatment for post-surgical pain and unravels the neuronal mechanisms of inhibition by LO and HA/3. 

In vivo, intra-p injection of LO selectively reduced activation of small-diameter DR neurons, mostly nocice, to noxious stimulation after plantar incision. HA3 was purified from water-soluble extract of AM, biochemically and functionally characterized using western blot and TR assays. Findings suggest HA3 may attenuate activation of key pain receptors such as TR1, TR1, and MrgD, decreasing nocpt excitability by membranepolar and altering intrinsic properties. CD is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein regulating physiologic and pathologic processes.
Researchers studied the pigmentation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC-RPE) in vitro and investigated whether their color is correlated with their function. They used the Automated Live and Picking System (ALPS) to photograph and analyze gene expression profiles of individual cells. The cells were categorized into four clusters based on gene expression, but color did not correlate with specific profiles. This suggests that color may not directly indicate functional characteristics of R cells. 

The researchers analyzed transcriptome of P-R cells and calculated brightness as a proxy for pigmentation. Gene enrichment analysis showed that pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, with a time lag between mRNA production and melanin synthesis. Results indicate color may not be an indicator of R markers. They found weak correlation between pigmentation and genes related to retin recycling, such as RD11, CO, RD10, DH3, and RD5, with coefficients 0.25, 0.20, 0.16, 0.12, and 0.11 respectively. Several studies suggest in vitro pigmentation may not reflect maturation, such as bone-derived R cells becoming pigmented after transplantation and iP-R cells becoming pigmented after engraft.
Researchers in the field of neuroscience have increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in their natural environments to gain a deeper understanding of ethologically relevant processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmet (Callithrix jacch) has emerged as a pivotal model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methods often fail to capture the nuances of marmet social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this gap, a novel apparatus, the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MAAP), was developed to study cooperative behaviors in commonmets. MAAP enables high-throughput, detailed outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more comprehensive analyses in naturalistic settings. It also accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual capabilities, and provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. MAAP is a versatile tool for advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations.

A modular and adaptable design, high-resolution data, and integration with neural recordings position MAAP as a robust tool unraveling complexities primate behavior. An innovative method was developed to capture cooperative behaviors in commonmets using an automated task. With increased trials through MAAP, the possibility of examining neural underlying behaviors inm is supported. The apparatus and paradigm represent an advancement, bridging traditional behavior studies ethologically relevant animals and precise investigations neural activity. Behavioral metrics from video and audio with mets' pulling and reward delivery provide a comprehensive understanding interplay behavior, communication, and interactions in this species using automated task.

MAAP and associated paradigms offer rich data and flexibility for tasks, creating an avenue for simultaneous recordings while mets are engaged in tasks by MA. MA significantly increases trials for analysis, ensuring power investigating relationship neural behaviors.
Researchers investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PA) on the developing offspring's genome using a physiologically relevant murine model. They found that early PA affected site-specific DNA methylation in newborns without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding regions with potential regulatory effects on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested effects on metastable genes linked to disease-relevant traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. A maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some damaging effects of early PA on DNA methylation. The study demonstrated that moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes, highlighting a role for preventative dietary interventions.

The study employed whole-genome bisulf sequencing for unbiased assessment of Cp DNA methylation in brain and liver, two organs affected by ethanol. Regions sensitive to gestational exposure were replicated in human cohorts. The study controlled the impact of early PA on DNA methylation comparing exposed and unexposed mice, with an additional arm comparing exposure in the context of a high maternal diet. Candidate testing of regions identified as sensitive to early PA was also conducted. The exposure period covered preconception until the first trimester, reflecting typical human consumption. Outcomes were differences in DNA methylation and secondary behavioral deficits across neurodevelopment relevant to FAS examined.

In validation, DNA methylation data from 147 newborn buccal swabs from the Asking About in Pregnancy cohort were used. Differential testing on 189 Cp sites corresponding to DMRs found no evidence of methylation. In the model, effects were predominantly tissue-specific, with two regions and genes similarly affected in liver and brain. Further analysis in germ tissues is required to establish.
Researchers have found that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective in silencing a wide variety of genes, but the loss of certain regulators in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair silencing of some genes. They discovered that this selectivity can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in RNA metabolism. The Mael domain protein RDE-10, intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and Argona protein NR-3 work together, where two are required for silencing one gene, but each singly required for silencing another. The requirement for NR-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and exploratory simulations led to three findings: changing cis-regulatory elements of the gene reduce dependence on NR-3, animals recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and cleavage tailing of mRNAs with U dinucleotides, which are templates for amplifying RNAs, are enriched in 'UG' zones matching dsRNA.

Extensive characterization of RNA in C elegans makes it suitable to examine differences between genes and reliance on regulators. A pathway required for silencing in response to dsRNA has been worked out in C elegans. Requirement of NR- but not MUT or R- can be bypassed by enhancing processing ds, suggesting NR has least impact on efficiency. A model of RNA during silencing by ds reveals criteria for efficient silencing. Two of MUT, NR, and R- structurally functionally different proteins are required for unc- silencing, suggesting each contributing to any RNA target. Mechanisms could generate other RN independent R- (Yang et al, 2012; Zhang et al 201). Studies needed to test each model. RNA widely applied for silencing in plants, insects, humans, C elegans, plants (San-Mra et 202) and insects (Pinon et. Observations influence gene factors on RNA outcome impel exploration of detailed model.
Researchers conducted a study on 281 Vietnamese adults with tuberculous meningitis (TBM), 295 with pulmonary tuberculosis (PT), and 30 healthy controls to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality. They used weighted gene-expression analysis to identify hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Multivariate Cox regression selected predictors of death, and logistic regression and bootstrap validation chose the best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with angiogenesis, while HIV-negative exhibited TNF signaling and impaired extracellular organization. Four genes (MMP1, N2, Z, C, and CD) were strong TBM predictors.

The study found common pathways in TBM mortality in HIV-positive and negative individuals, but differences included increased angiogenesis in HIV adults and TNF signaling in HIV-negative. A four-gene signature was identified as a potential response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status. Multivariate Cox regression selected predictors for HIV-negative TBM consisted of common genes, HIV-specific genes, and clinical biomarkers age, T severity, and CSF lymphocyte count. The study aimed to identify baseline signatures predicting death or survival from TBM, selecting potential predictors from common and HIV hub genes. Three clinical factors (age, M grade, and CSF lymphocyte) were used for candidate selection.

Transcription profiles with T mortality stratified by HIV showed 786 (3.9%) differentially expressed in HIV-negative and 1628.1% in HIV-positive. The study hypothesized host signatures differ according to HIV status.
Researchers assessed the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 human proteins, using a standardized approach to evaluate specificity in three common laboratory applications: Western blot (WB), immunoprecipitation (IP), and immunofluorescence (IF). The study found that more than 50% of antibodies failed in one or more applications, yet ~50-75% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody, indicating significant coverage by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies outperformed monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were used in published studies, prompting manufacturers to reassess and alter usage or remove some from market. This study demonstrates the scale of specificity problem and suggests a strategy to achieve proteome coverage using existing repertoire and data for new generation. 

The researchers developed protocols to assess specificity in WB, IP, and IF, and tested 614 antibodies against 65 targets chosen by funders to cover mammalian proteome. The study provides an unbiased framework for performance comparison, coverage, and value of characterization, and identifies renewable antibodies for all proteins. Approximately two-thirds of proteins were covered by at least high-performing antibody and half by at least high-performing recombinant, suggesting significant coverage by high-performing antibodies. 

The analysis of 614 commercial antibodies assesses the performance and a step toward comprehensive validation. 65 proteins were tested side-by in WB, IP, and IF, with data openly available. Antibodies are critical in biomedical research, enabling identification, quantification, and localization, with ~1.6M targeting ~96% human proteins.
Researchers have developed a new tools to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal, particularly in the context of inter-organ studies. This was achieved by combining the GAL4/UAS system with a second binary system, such as the LexA or Q system. A set of reagents were created to facilitate the use of GAL/UAS and second system in Drosophila tissues, focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL expression patterns. Over 40 LexAAD and Q2 insertions were generated by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae. Constructs encoding Q2 and Lex-G transcription factors in a single vector were built. Successful integration of this construct into the genome and FLP recombination was used to isolate lines that express only Q2 or Lex-G. New shRNA vectors were used to evaluate Lex and Q systems for in vivo knockdown, generating a library of RNAi lines as a resource. These Lex and Q system vectors and lines provide new tools for researchers to activate or repress different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal.

A vector was integrated into the genome to generate a driver that expresses Q2 and Lex-G. One of the coding regions can be excised with Fl, resulting in flies that only express Q or Lex-G. Both Q and Lex systems were evaluated for in vivo knockdown and a library of transgenic shRNA lines were generated in QU and Lexop vectors as a resource. A plasm was synthesized that contains features for CRPR HDR and cloning of T2-LA-G, T-Q, or T-G-T fragments to produce a single plasmid. Genes with tissue-specific expression were selected, encompassing major organs of the fly (Table 1). Most are induced fluorescent reporter genes, not molecular reagents such as shRN for RNAi. Lack of fly reagents slows studies requiring two binary systems, custom re must be made by groups. Several methods generate drivers with tissue-specific patterns. Genes with characterized GAL insertion and evidence specificity were selected. Donors were cloned into Cas-express embryos to induce CRPR HDR of T-G or T (Figure 1 and ). A set of stocks, vectors, and protocols were generated to expand Dophila researchers modulate expression multiple simultaneously.
The transcription factor B11 (B11) has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. B11 is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy-CA synapses. The molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. This study shows that the synaptic molecule Cql is a direct target of B11 that regulates vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at moss-CA synapses in vivo and vitro. Furthermore, Cql exerts its functions through interaction with a specific variant neurexin-3, Nrx (25+. Interruption Cql-Nrx (25+) by expression a non-binding Cql mutant or deletion Nrx in dentate gyrus neurons recapitulates major B11 and Cql phenotypes. This study identifies aql-Nrx (25)-dependent pathway through B11 controls moss- synapse function, contributing to mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopment disorders by synaptic dysfunction.

B11 is involved in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders with synaptic dysfunction. Previous work demonstrated B11 essential for synapse in moss fiber of adult hippocampus. Molecular mechanisms of B11, however, remained elusive. B plays crucial role in development hippocal moss fiber, adult hippocal neurogenesis, and hippocal learning and memory. In mature hippocampus, B is critical for structural and functional of moss synapses, connections between D and CA pyramidal neurons. This study identifies novel B11/Cql/Nrx (25)-dependent mechanism for control of synapse.

Conditional ablation of B in adult hippocampus leads structural and functional changes syn characterized reduction in numbers, loss bouton, misdistribution and loss. Reintroduction of synaptic proteinql, direct target of B and downregulated in B mutant DGN, identifies Bql/Nrx-dependent pathway in control basic and properties of syn. Analysis this pathway may provide insights into pathogenesis neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders.
Researchers have investigated the role of the zinc finger protein S1 (S1) in regulating transcription and post-transcription processes. They found that S1 can regulate transcription by binding to promoters like known transcription activators or to transcribed gene bodies via RNA polymerase II (Pol). The study focused on the first mode of S1 activity and found that after promoter binding, S1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol configuration by dissociation or conformation change of its Rpb subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, S1 binds a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between S1 and mRNAs is controlled by their promoters and coincides with S1 dissociation from chromatin. Intrigly, S dissociation from chrom correlates with extent of backtracked Pol. They propose that following recruitment, S accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking. Backtracked Pol is compatible with S relocation to nascent, where S accompanies mRN to cytoplasm and regulates stability. S co-transcription imprints mRNA fate, serving paradigm for cross-talk between synthesis and decay specific mRN and paradigm dual-role zincinger proteins.

S1 impacts mRNA cycle from transcription to degradation. Its effect on elongation linked to function, suggesting connected. S possesses two fingers. Correlation found between binding S to bodies and Pol occupancy in genes. Capacity to alter Pol in context R4 and affect back underlies widespread effect. Alteration configuration reflected in increased backtracking, indicated by values. Binding to bodies with Pol activity, particularly CR genes. Function in subset target genes beyond initiation encompasses elongation, proposed earlier. Interaction with chrom has effect on Pol elong and mRN, mechanistic linkage. Rpb subunit enhances Pol activity and mRNA due co-transcription imprinting. Taking observations, back associated with co-binding S to nas. Reassuring, genes exhibit S-dependent back also imprint S, whereas do not do not. Unexpected, addition chrom feature, S binds subpopulation mRN transcription stimulated S-CRN.
Researchers investigated the connection between programmed cell death during development (PCD) and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thalian roots, focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SMB and senescence-associated nuclease B1. Mutations in both PC regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the merematic zone and delayed S-induced root growth promotion. This suggests that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcription analysis revealed B1 expression downregulation during S colonization in mature epidermal cells, indicating a transcriptional control facilitating accommodation of beneficial microbes in roots.

The study found that impaired PC in Arabidopsis smb- and b1 mutants increased colonization by the endophyte S indica. The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolonization along the primary root, suggesting the excess of cell corpses surrounding smb roots provide additional nutrients for fungal colonization. PC protects the meristem from microbial colonization, but some microbes manipulate host PC processes by affecting B1 transcription to facilitate accommodation in roots. Transcript analysis showed significant decrease in B1 expression after 6 days post-inoculation in older root parts, independent of fungal colonization. Inoculation of B1 reporter lines with S observed reduction in promoter activity in epider cells in contact with fungus compared to mock-treated roots. B1 expression and localization in root xylem was not affected by S.

The study proposes that tight regulation of PC and rapid clearance of root cell corpses restricts fungal colonization at the apical meristem, and that S downregulates B1 in older epidermal cells to promote accommodation. The results show beneficial microbes modify plant PC processes to enhance colonization.
Researchers investigated the role of large vesicle extrusion from neurons in neurodegenerative disease, focusing on the nematode C elegans as a model organism. They found that mechanical force can potentiate exopher extrusion from proteressed neurons, with production peaking at day 2-3, coinciding with the C eleg reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early production suppressed exopher from the AL neuron during the peak, while restoring egg production through mating or genetic interventions increased it. Interventions promoting AL ex production were associated with expanded uterus lengths, while suppressing it was associated with shorter lengths. Fertilized eggs, oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid in the uterus enhanced ex production, suggesting mechanical uter occupation potentiates ex from proximal maternal neurons. The study highlights the importance of mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
Recent studies suggest that the Wnt signaling pathway plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD), with the secreted antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) found to co-localize with amyloid plaques in AD patients. This study investigates the contribution of DKK to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains, revealing that DKK expression is upregulated in AD brains and DKK levels increase early in the disease. In AD mouse models, extracellular DKK is increased and DKK accumulates around dystrophic neuronal processes. Functionally, DKK triggers loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of Wnt/GSKβ signaling and increase inhibitory syn via W/JNK. In contrast, DKK knockdown restores synapse and memory in AD mice. The study shows DKK regulates stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus through different pathways. Knocking down DKK in AD mice ameliorates changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus before and after plaque deposition. DKK loss-of-function ameliorates synaptic defects in AD mice, supporting DKK as a key contributor to synaptic changes in this model. Synapse loss around amyloid plaques is a feature of AD, and DKK affects synapse number around plaques in AD mice. The study investigates the role of DKK in integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. Synapse loss correlates with cognitive impairment in AD, but mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the function of W antagonist DKK on synaptic and memory in healthy and AD brains.
Researchers have identified a potential new approach to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria by exploring natural compounds produced by microbes to inhibit competitors. They found that iron-chelating pyoverdines, siderophores produced by Pseudomonas species, have antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens uncovered pyd with high antibacterial properties and distinct characteristics. The most potent pydine reduced growth of Acinetobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, and Staphlococcus aureus in concentration-dependent manner. Pyd increased survival of infected Galleria mellella larvae showed low toxicity for mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes. Experimental evolution of pathogens with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance compared to antibiotic. Pyd from environmental strains have potential to become new class of antibacterials against human pathogens.
Researchers have long understood that schizophrenia is linked to failures in the prefrontal network, but the underlying mechanisms at the synaptic level remain unclear. This gap in understanding hinders the discovery of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to prefrontal network failures in schizophrenia. To address this question, a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal circuits was developed to explain the link between NMDA receptor synaptic and 0-lag synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological model of prefront network failure in schizophrenia. The model analyzed the balance between AMPA and NMD components of recurrent excitation and GABA in the network's influence on oscillatory spike synchrony, informing biological data. Reducing NMD synaptic currents prevented the network from shifting to an oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, paralleling dynamic modulation of 0-l spike synchrony observed between neurons in prefront cortex during behavior and suppression by NMD antagonists. The model provides a plausible link between NMD synaptic and 0ag synchrony deficits in pharmacological model prefront failure schizophrenia.

 The study established a theoretical basis for how NMD reduction in schizophrenia leads to desynchronization in prefront recurrent circuits, providing evidence that spiking networks near the boundary between asynchronous and synchronous states explain biological observations. Reducing NMD currents prevented networks from transitioning to oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, preventing 0ag synchrony. Prior studies addressed the relationship between NMD function and oscillatory prefront networks, but not the topic of how NMD recurrent excitation and external input influence spike timing and oscillatory dynamics in the presence of AMP. This study developed a spiking network to understand the link between NAR malfunction and reduced 0ag spiking observed in biological data, the emergence of 0ag spiking between prefront neurons when inputs push the boundary, and failure of spiking to emerge when NMD currents are reduced, observed in prefront recordings.
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones in hypoxic environments, involves the differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St cell phenotypes controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication. The spatial patterning of this cell specification is not fully understood. Researchers combined experimental and computational models to find that Tip-St cell patterning undergoes an order-disorder transition at high pro-angiogenic VEGF levels, resulting in robust but unstable differentiation for most cells, with a subset of Tip cells sprouting. Sprouts form maximizing mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model dependent on fibronectin enrichment. NOT signaling mediates robust differentiation but not instructive steps in angiogenesis requiring additional cues and self-organization.

In the context of angiogenesis, effective vascular morphogenesis through endothelial differentiation into Tip and St states is guided by proangi cues, VEG, and paracrine-NOTCH signaling. Mathematical models propose Turing mechanisms, but need testing for causality. Our analysis supports dynamic angi induction: VEG input induces NOT signaling, Tip cells behaving as sprouts. Inputs specifying fate can be contradictory, e.g., VEG promoting Tip, NOT St, suppressing Tip. Signaling can result in complex, poorly understood outcomes based on Tip/St ratio.

We calibrated model parameters to match VEG input 100 ng/ml observed Tip/St at same VEG input. To compare predictions and observations, we quantified spatial patterning of Tip cells in angiogenesis. Endothelial induction may contrast with multicellular processes, NOT modulating leader/follower patterns, underscoring need for refined models integrating biochemical/mechanical regulation Tip-St fate.
Researchers investigated the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) and its projections to the hippocampus in learning and memory, specifically during fear conditioning in mice. The LC is typically known to modulate neural activity through norepinephrine release, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other regions. The study found that LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli, and optogenetic stimulation enhances long-term memory formation. LC activity increases both norephrine and dopamine in the hippocampus, with dopamine release timing similar to LC activity. Hippocampal dopamine is important for fear memory, while norephrine is not. LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning events, enhancing long-term formation, but unclear which neurotransmitter is released. Norepineph is the primary LC source in the brain, but dopamine may be partially responsible for observed effects. Direct manipulation is needed to confirm. LC increases dopamine and noreph in the hippocampus, with dopamine required for fear memory, not nphrine. The locus coeruleus and hippocampus are critical for hippocampus-dependent memory, but temporal dynamics poorly understood due to spatial tasks.
