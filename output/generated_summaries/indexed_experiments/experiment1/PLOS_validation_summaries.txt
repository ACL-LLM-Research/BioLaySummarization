Alternative polyadenylation in human B-lymphoblastoid cells has been shown to play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression and its variation across genetically distinct human individuals. We conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals and found that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes, and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms. Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5, we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation. Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate.
SIVΔnef, a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine, is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy. Here, we demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes, followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape. Furthermore, we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes, defined as anentropic specificity, and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period. These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth. Importantly, these findings render SIVΔnef, long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research, as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design.
Candida albicans is one of the most common causes of mucosal fungal infections. The immune response to C. albicans in the oral mucosa is primarily mediated by cellular immunity. However, the mechanisms underlying the induction of antifungal immunity are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the neutrophil response to C. albicans in the oral mucosa. Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ), we show that IL-1R signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection. We demonstrate that IL-1R signaling regulates the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow. We also show that IL-1R signaling regulates the production of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in response to C. albicans. We identified endothelial cells as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC, which responded to IL-1α released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. Our data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection. Together, we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa, which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination, and thus protects the host from disease.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( GPELF ) delivered more than 1. 9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via annual mass drug administration ( MDA ) of albendazole, ivermectin, and diethylcarbamazine to all at-risk populations for 4–6 years. To quantify the economic benefits of this achievement, the number of clinical manifestations averted was estimated and the savings associated with this disease prevention were analyzed in the context of direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost-labor, and costs to the health system to care for affected individuals. An estimated US$21. 8 billion of direct economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31. 4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the GPELF. Of this total, over US$2. 3 billion is realized by the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis as a result of their being born into areas freed of LF transmission. Additionally, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefit from GPELF's halting the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately US$19. 5 billion.
Gaucher disease ( GD ) is the most common lysosomal storage disease caused by homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) gene, leading to decreased enzymatic activity of glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) and accumulation of glucocerebroside and glucosylsphingosine. Mutations in GBA also confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ). We generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in GCase activity and display pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD, including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Detailed pathological findings revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span, formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka. Our data suggest that GCase deficiency causes lysosomal dysfunction in neurons and α-syn accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes, and that α-syn may play an important role in the mechanisms of GBA mutations leading to PD. Furthermore, we demonstrate the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka.
Listeria monocytogenes, a facultative intracellular pathogen, is capable of inducing a robust cell-mediated immune response to sub-lethal infection. However, we show that L. monocytogenes confined within a phagosome suppresses the adaptive immune response. This suppression is not merely a consequence of inefficient antigen presentation, but is the result of direct suppression of the adaptive response. The presence of phagosome-confined L. monocytogenes not only limits the adaptive response to vacuole-confined L. monocytogenes, but also negates the response to L. monocytogenes within the cytosol. Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L. monocytogenes prevents the generation of acquired immunity and limits the expansion of antigen-specific T cells relative to the cytosolic L. monocytogenes strain alone. We show that phagosome-confined L. monocytogenes suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leads to the rapid MyD88-dependent production of IL-10. Blockade of the IL-10 receptor or the absence of MyD88 during primary infection restores protective immunity. Our studies demonstrate that the presence of microbes within a phagosome can directly impact the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing the signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and the generation of protective CD8 T cells.
Primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) is the most common type of glaucoma and a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Genome-wide association studies have previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus. We sequenced the SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls and identified six nonsynonymous coding variants, including five rare and one common variant, Asn141His ( rs33912345 ), which was associated significantly with POAG in the NEIGHBOR/GLAUGEN datasets. These variants were tested in an in vivo Danio rerio ( zebrafish ) complementation assay to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic nerve structure. Five variants, found primarily in POAG cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth variant, found only in controls, was benign. One variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation. We identified a clinical feature in POAG patients that appears to be dependent upon SIX6 genotype: patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele ( His141 ) have a statistically thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than patients homozygous for the SIX6 non-risk allele ( Asn141 ). Our results lead us to hypothesize that SIX6 risk variants disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells, thereby increasing the risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss.
Clostridium difficile, a human intestinal pathogen, produces flagella that promote adherence to intestinal epithelial cells and indirectly impact the production of glucosylating toxins, which are essential for diarrheal disease development. Here, we report the identification of a flagellar switch that controls the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins in C. difficile. The flagellar switch is a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats located upstream of the flgB operon containing the early stage flagellar genes. Bacteria with the flagellar switch in one orientation ( “flg phase ON” ) express flagellum and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete the toxins. In contrast, bacteria with the flagellar switch in the inverse orientation ( “flg phase OFF” ) are attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression, are aflagellate, and show decreased toxin secretion. The orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro. We provide evidence that gene regulation via the flagellar switch occurs post-transcription initiation and requires a C. difficile-specific regulatory factor to destabilize or degrade the early flagellar gene mRNA when the flagellar switch is in the OFF orientation. The tyrosine recombinase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch, is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions.
Clostridium difficile is an obligate anaerobic pathogen in which endospores play a central role in the infectious cycle. We have studied the function and regulation of the sporulation sigma factors in C. difficile, which are key regulators of the endosporulation pathway. The sporulation sigma factors in C. difficile are σF, σE, σG, and σK, which control gene expression in the forespore and mother cell during endospore development. Our results show that while the main periods of activity of the sigma factors are conserved, the activity of σE is partially independent of σF, σG activity is not dependent on σE, and the activity of σK does not require σG. We also show that σK is not strictly required for heat resistant spore formation. Our results indicate reduced temporal segregation between the activities of the early and late sigma factors, and reduced requirement for the σF-to-σE, σE-to-σG, and σG-to-σK cell-cell signaling pathways. The activity of σK does not require σG, but mutation of sigG reduces the activity of σK at late stages of spore morphogenesis. Our results support the view that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved in evolution, with the sigma factors acting as the key regulators of the pathway, established some 2. 5 billion years ago upon its emergence at the base of the Firmicutes Phylum.
Multisite allosteric proteins can be difficult to model due to the large number of possible phosphoforms. We present a compact framework to model the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable. This reduction can closely replicate the steady state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models. We show that optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant. This reduction makes the framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications, where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously. We apply this framework to a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast, which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth. We show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch. This system incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred.
Quorum sensing ( QS ) is a mechanism by which bacteria communicate with each other to achieve multicellularity and gain a selective advantage. However, the mechanistic underpinnings of QS “switching” phenomena have remained elusive. In this study, we employed a combination of experimental work and mathematical models to decipher the network connectivity and signal transduction in the autoinducer-2 ( AI-2 ) QS system of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ). We separated the network architecture into sub-networks to examine negative and positive feedback mechanisms. A new unreported negative feedback interaction was hypothesized and tested via a simple mathematical model. We also revealed the importance of the LsrR regulator and its determinant role in the E. coli QS “switch”, which is normally masked by interfering regulatory loops. Our simple model allowed for a mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory sub-structures and their contributions to the overall native functioning network. This “bottom-up” approach will serve to unravel complex QS network architectures and lead to the directed coordination of emergent behaviors.
Schistosoma haematobium infection has been shown to increase the risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children living in rural areas of Gabon. In this longitudinal study, we investigated the effect of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) on the prevalence and incidence of P. falciparum infection in school-age children living in two rural communities in the vicinity of Lambaréné, Gabon. Our results show that schistosomiasis tends to increase the risk of P. falciparum infection, but when combined with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection, the risk is significantly increased ( aOR = 3. 9 [95%CI: 1. 7–9. 2] ). The incidence of malaria over time was 0. 51[95%CI: 0. 45–0. 57] per person-year and was higher in the Schistosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group ( 0. 61 vs 0. 43, p = 0. 02 ), with a significant delay of time-to first-malaria event only in children aged from 6 to 10-years-old infected with Schistosoma haematobium. Our results suggest that STH enhance the risk for P. falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children, and when infected, that schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children.
Leishmania donovani infection induces an inflammatory response mainly mediated by the transcription factor IRF-5. IRF-5 is responsible for the activation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF. During L. donovani infection, the inflammatory response induced by IRF-5 limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1α expression in dendritic cells. Induction of HIF-1α in dendritic cells results in decreased IL-12 and increased IL-10 expression. Ablation of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells leads to a higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8+ T cells, enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and increased IL-12 expression by splenic DCs. Moreover, mice with a targeted depletion of HIF-1α in CD11c+ cells have a significantly lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting that induction of HIF-1α may represent an immune evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections.
Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a serious public health problem in endemic regions, especially in the Indian sub-continent, North and East Africa, and South America. VL is one of the most neglected diseases in the world, closely associated with poverty, for which effective and affordable chemotherapies remain scarce. In the context of high fatality rates associated with VL, the identification of prognostic factors to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes represents a potential tool for clinical practice. This systematic review brings together information from 14 studies conducted in Latin America on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis and death from VL. The strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and age >40–50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnoea and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far. Integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations.
Leishmaniasis is a major public health problem in Algeria, where the treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis ( VL and CL ) has been based on antimony-containing drugs for decades. However, high drug selective pressure may favor the emergence of chemoresistant parasites. We investigated the antimony susceptibility of Leishmania isolates collected over a 30-year period in Algeria. We analyzed 106 isolates collected between 1976 and 2013 from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines, as well as 18 isolates from dogs in France. We determined the 50% inhibitory concentrations ( IC50 ) of potassium antimony tartrate ( Sb ( III ) ) and sodium stibogluconate ( Sb ( V ) ) in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastigotes, respectively. We also determined the epidemiological cutoff ( ECOFF ) that allowed us to differentiate between Leishmania species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis that were susceptible ( S+ ) or insusceptible ( S- ) to the trivalent form of antimony. Our results show a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in VL isolates during the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in the frequency of S- phenotypes in isolates causing CL was observed during the same period. The emergence of S- phenotypes correlates with the inclusion of L. killicki ( syn: L. tropica ) isolates that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and that have emerged in Algeria during the last decade. Our results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria and highlight the need for the future implementation of an effective methodology to determine the antimony susceptibility status of Leishmania isolates to detect the emergence of and prevent the dissemination of drug-resistant strains.
Crohn’s disease ( CD ) is a chronic inflammatory condition of diverse etiology. We investigated the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and the onset of CD. We developed two novel models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli ( AIEC ), a bacterial pathobiont linked to CD. We show that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by the tissue-associated expansion of the resident AIEC pathobiont, with an attendant increase in immunopathology, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. These features required AIEC resistance to host defense peptides and a fulminant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. Our results suggest that individuals colonized by AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for CD onset. Importantly, our data identify AIEC as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals. We show that AIEC-colonized mice that develop infectious gastroenteritis in response to either Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium have a worsened outcome compared to AIEC-naïve animals exposed to the same infection stimuli.
In flowering plants, the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consists of two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, and five accessory cells. The mechanisms that underlie the formation of accessory versus gametic cell fate are unknown. In a screen for regulators of egg cell fate, we isolated the lachesis ( lis ) mutant which forms supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells differentiate gametic cell fate, indicating that LIS is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from adopting gametic cell fate. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests that this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homologous to the yeast splicing factor PRP4, indicating that components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions. Our results suggest that all cells in the female gametophyte are competent to differentiate gametic cell fate and that LIS is involved in a mechanism that represses gametic cell fate in the accessory cells. The lis-1 mutant phenotype reveals two levels of cell fate regulation, one between gametic and accessory cells, and one between egg and central cell. The late initiation of cell-specific marker genes indicates that in Arabidopsis distinct cell fates are only manifested after cellularization.
Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) such as podoconiosis, triggered by exposure to irritant soils in the tropical highlands, can be prevented through the use of footwear. However, in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis, there are considerable barriers to consistent use of shoes. Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model, we assessed the social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological needs influencing whether and when children wear shoes in this community. We gathered information from 242 respondents using focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and extended case studies. We found that shoe-wearing norms are changing, with going barefoot increasingly seen as ‘shameful’. However, many practical and social barriers prevent the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice. Limited financial resources mean that people are neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of the preferred quality. As a result, shoes are typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reach a certain age. We identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention and which we anticipate will be of benefit to those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution. These barriers are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs and include financial constraints, poor suitability of shoes for common activities, and low perceptions of disease risk.
Pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) Us9 is a viral protein that plays a central role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of infected neurons. We have shown that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts on the surface of infected cells, and that this association is critical for Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins to axons. In this report, we demonstrate that Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes ( DRMs ) of non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor ( NGF ). We also show that reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibits anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. We conclude that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and, as a consequence, for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. Our findings are consistent with a model where viral capsids and membrane proteins traffic together in axons as mature virus particles.
Nongenetic heterogeneity is a phenomenon in which genetically identical cells exhibit extensive phenotypic variation even under constant and benign conditions. This phenomenon has important clinical implications, as cells within tumors and microbial infections show nongenetic heterogeneity in growth rate and in susceptibility to drugs or stress. Using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model, we show that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels acting through the Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway and its target transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth, as shown by direct comparison of cAMP concentration in subpopulations enriched for slower vs. faster growing cells. The paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity in a way that demonstrates slow growth and stress tolerance are not inevitably linked. Heterogeneity in growth rate requires both Msn2 and Msn4, whereas only Msn2 is required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway, or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or the PKA inhibitor H89, significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress. Our results shed light on the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.
Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ), an alphavirus and member of the Togaviridae family, is responsible for causing severe febrile disease in humans. In December 2013, the Asian Lineage of CHIKV spread from the Old World to the Americas and rapidly spread throughout the New World. To understand how CHIKV may have evolved during this outbreak, we studied the viral genetic diversity present in infected individuals from Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands in the center of the epidemic. We used deep-sequencing technologies to characterize the minority variants and diversity present in CHIKV infected individuals. We observed changes in the consensus sequence as well as a diverse range of minority variants present at various levels in the population. Furthermore, we found that overall diversity was dramatically reduced after single passages in cell lines. We constructed an infectious clone from this outbreak and identified a novel 3’ untranslated region ( UTR ) structure, not previously found in nature, that led to increased replication in insect cells.
UBTOR, a previously unannotated gene, has been identified as a functional player in regulating cell growth and mTOR signaling. We show that reduction of UBTOR function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth, while UBTOR depletion activates mTOR signaling and promotes cell growth. In contrast, UBTOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Mechanistic studies reveal that UBTOR inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing DEPTOR, a component of the mTOR complex. In zebrafish, disruption of the ubtor gene results in higher mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS ( G12V ) induced neoplasia. Furthermore, UBTOR depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in a xenograft mouse model. These findings demonstrate how UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia via mTOR signaling.
Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis, is a highly diverged organism from well-studied eukaryotes such as yeast and mammals. As a result, more than half of its proteins have unknown functions, hindering our understanding of its biology and pathogenesis. To address this knowledge gap, we systematically interrogated the co-complex interactions of more than 3354 protein groups in the procyclic life stage of T. brucei using biochemical fractionation. Our analysis led to the identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 protein groups, including 635 protein groups that lacked experimental annotation. These complexes correlate well with known pathways and proteins co-expressed across the T. brucei life cycle, and provide potential functions for a large number of previously uncharacterized proteins. We validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery, including a candidate potentially involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei. Our results provide an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T. brucei and serve as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) is a bacterium that causes tuberculosis ( TB ), which is commonly considered a chronic lung disease. However, Mtb can also cause extrapulmonary infection in any organ, and lymph nodes ( LNs ) are among the most common sites of infection. Despite this, the dynamics of Mtb infection in LNs and its effect on LN structure and function are relatively unstudied. We analyzed thoracic LNs from Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macaques using PET CT scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. We found that LNs in Mtb-infected macaques increased in PET-CT-measured metabolic activity early during infection, and at necropsy, almost all of the FDG-avid LNs contained viable Mtb or persistent Mtb DNA. We show that Mtb grows to the same level in LNs of both macaque species, but cynomolgus macaque LNs were better able to control the infection compared to rhesus macaque LNs. Notably, compared to lung granulomas, LNs are generally poor at killing Mtb, even with drug treatment. Granulomas that form in Mtb-infected LNs disrupt LN structure and are associated with higher Mtb burden. Our data support that LNs are not only sites of antigen presentation and immune activation during infection, but also serve as important sites for persistence of significant numbers of Mtb bacilli.
Microsporidia are obligate intracellular parasites that infect a wide range of animals, including nematodes. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a model host to study microsporidia, but little was known about the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes in the wild. Here, we describe the isolation and culture of 47 nematodes with microsporidian infections. We found that Nematocida parisii is the most common microsporidian infecting C. elegans in the wild. In addition, we describe and name six new species in the Nematocida genus, as well as two new genera, Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, which are genetically distinct from Nematocida and belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. These microsporidia are horizontally transmitted and most specifically infect intestinal cells, except for Pancytospora epiphaga, which replicates mostly in the epidermis of its Caenorhabditis host. We also show that some microsporidia have broad host specificity, while others have narrow host specificity. For example, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3, and conversely some microsporidia found infecting Oscheius sp. 3 do not infect O. tipulae. Our results illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes and provide a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts.
Chemokine receptors are a subclass of G protein coupled receptors that play a crucial role in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis as well as HIV infection. Chemokine receptors can form homo- and heterodimers or higher order oligomers, which modulate receptor function. However, structural information about chemokine receptor homo- and heterodimers and their interaction with cholesterol is limited. Here, we report the homo- and heterodimerization patterns of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at an atomistic level using thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that the closely related CC chemokine receptors CCR5 and CCR2 share common features with regard to dimerization and interactions with cholesterol that differ from the previously reported characteristics of CXCR4. Cholesterol modulates the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview of the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.
Systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, has been found to present with a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected. In addition to the classical form of the disease, characterized by prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting, a sub-clinical form and an atypical form have been identified. The atypical form presents with depressed immunity and symptoms masquerading as a condition in which the immune system is non-functional, leading to recurrent secondary infections and a variety of clinical signs and symptoms. This atypical form was identified in 19. 4% of 160 patients with depressed immunity who were referred to a specialized laboratory for further evaluation of their immune system function. Among these patients, 31 were adults, indicating that systemic leishmaniasis is not limited to the pediatric age group. The diagnosis of atypical systemic leishmaniasis should be entertained in any patient with an unexplained depressed immunity state and in whom no obvious immunologic defect can be identified. Our findings suggest that systemic leishmaniasis is far more common than diagnosed to date and that it presents with a much wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected.
A genome-wide analysis of human disease alleles reveals that their locations are correlated in paralogous proteins. We have assembled a unique collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and the Human Genome Mutation Database ( HGMD ) and used them to identify and characterize pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins. Our analyses demonstrate that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins. Moreover, if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. We find that sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance, suggesting that similar functional constraints on paralogous protein sequences result in coordinated distributions of both disease and non–disease-causing variants along their lengths. These data show how paralogous disease genes and their variant-pairs can be used for hypothesis generation and as points of departure for further clinical research. We have also assembled a collection of known disease-causing variations drawn from OMIM and HGMD and mapped each of these variations to their gene annotations and protein sequences.
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria, is exposed to multiple selection pressures within the human host. However, the extent to which the parasite responds to or is selected by the host environment in severe malaria remains unclear. We used RNA sequencing ( RNAseq ) to analyse gene expression in 44 parasite isolates that caused severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papuan patients. The transcriptomes of 19 parasite isolates associated with severe malaria indicated that these parasites had decreased glycolysis without activation of compensatory pathways; altered chromatin structure and probably transcriptional regulation through decreased histone methylation; reduced surface expression of PfEMP1; and down-regulated expression of multiple chaperone proteins. We also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments, and confirmed all previously reported associations between expressed PfEMP1 sequences and severe disease. These findings will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and indicate how parasites adapt to or are selected by the host environment in severe malaria.
HIV-1 infection is a major global health problem, and the development of effective prevention strategies is urgently needed. One promising approach is the delivery of broadly-neutralizing antibodies via adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) vectors. In this study, we investigated the protective effects of AAV-delivered anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) in rhesus monkeys against SIVmac239 challenge. We used an AAV vector to deliver the anti-SIV mAb 5L7 IgG1 intramuscularly to rhesus monkeys, achieving persisting levels of delivered mAb as high as 270 μg/ml. However, host antibody responses to the delivered mAb were observed in 9 of the 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration of delivered mAb that could be achieved. Despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity against the challenge virus, the six monkeys in the AAV-5L7 IgG1 mAb group showed clear protective effects against SIVmac239 challenge. These effects included lowering of viral load at peak height, lowering of viral load at set point, and delay in the time to peak viral load from the time of the infectious virus exposure. The monkey with the highest level of delivered 5L7 mAb completely resisted six successive SIVmac239 i. v. challenges, including a final challenge with a dose of 10 i. v. infectious units. Our results demonstrate the continued promise of this approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection in people. However, the problem of anti-antibody responses will need to be understood and overcome for the promise of this approach to be effectively realized.
Motor proteins, such as myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, have traditionally been studied under the assumption that they respond linearly to thermal noise or structural perturbations. However, we have found that this linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformational motions and can even be violated for characteristic thermal fluctuations. We have performed numerical investigations of the conformational relaxation properties of myosin V and kinesin KIF1A within the coarse-grained elastic network approximation. Our results indicate that neither a single normal mode nor a superposition of such modes yields an approximation of the strongly nonlinear dynamics of these motor proteins. While slow conformational relaxation motions in myosin V can still be qualitatively characterized in terms of normal modes, the normal mode description breaks down completely for kinesin KIF1A. We have found that ordered and robust mechanochemical motions are characteristic for both protein motors, even though they cannot be described in terms of the linear response. These motions, which follow after an energetic activation, are conformational relaxation processes. Large-scale conformational changes may take place in proteins as a result of ligand binding. Our results indicate that important assumptions of the theory of protein dynamics may need to be reconsidered.
Clathrin-independent ( CI ) endocytic pathways, such as the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment ( CLIC/GEEC ) pathway, have been difficult to study due to the lack of specific cargo or regulators. Here, we show that specific caveolar proteins, including caveolins and cavins, are negative regulators of the CLIC/GEEC pathway. Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4, inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway in a process independent of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 ( CAV1 ) and CAV3 also inhibit the CLIC/GEEC pathway upon over-expression. Expression of caveolar proteins leads to a reduction in the formation of early CLIC/GEEC carriers, as detected by quantitative electron microscopy analysis. Furthermore, the CLIC/GEEC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by the isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed diffusion of lipid microdomain components. In the absence of cavins, CAV1 is itself endocytosed preferentially through the CLIC/GEEC pathway, but the pathway loses polarization and sorting attributes with consequences for membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue. We also found that noncaveolar Cavin-1 can act as a modulator for the activity of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, Cdc42.
Aspartate-Less Receiver ( ALR ) domains are an atypical subclass of Receiver ( REC ) domains that lack the conserved aspartate ( Asp ) residue required for phosphorylation by sensory histidine kinases in typical two-component signaling systems. We have compiled a dataset of 2, 976 REC domains that are missing or have substitutions at the conserved Asp position, which we have renamed as Aspartate-Less Receivers ( ALRs ). Our data show that ALRs are surprisingly common, comprising ~4% of all REC domains and ~2 per completed genome in bacteria. ALRs are enriched for when attached to more rare effector outputs and have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs other than Asp phosphorylation, such as binding small molecules and Ser-Thr phosphorylation through bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases and their cognate PP2C phosphatases. Our analysis of ALR atomic structures, combined with structural, biochemical and genetic data of the ALR archetype RitR from Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggests that ALRs have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while largely retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface.
Oncolytic herpes simplex viruses ( oHSVs ) have shown efficacy in clinical trials, but most of them are attenuated or over-attenuated due to deletions/mutations in genes that counteract the host response. We have developed next-generation oHSVs that carry no deletions/mutations and gain cancer-specificity from specific retargeting to tumor cell receptors, such as HER2. These viruses are fully virulent in targeted cancer cells, but spare other cells in the tumor. We report on the first efficacy study of HER2-retargeted, fully-virulent oHSVs in immunocompetent mice. Both the unarmed R-LM113 and the IL-12-armed R-115 inhibited the growth of the primary HER2-Lewis lung carcinoma-1 ( HER2-LLC1 ) tumor, with R-115 being more efficacious. Mice that survived the primary tumor were protected from the growth of contralateral untreated tumors, providing evidence for an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis of the local response showed that R-115 unleashed the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines, including IFNγ and T-bet, which promoted Th1 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating cells, such as CD4+, CD335+, CD8+, Foxp3+, CD141+, and CD11b+ cells, were increased in the tumors of all responders, with R-115-treated mice showing preferential increases in CD8+, Foxp3+, CD141+ cells and decreases in CD11b+ cells. The durable response included a breakage of tolerance towards both HER2 and wild-type tumor cells, and underscored a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine response.
HIV vaccine vector-induced CD4 T cells manifest marked differences in their susceptibility to HIV infection. While Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells are readily susceptible to HIV, ALVAC vector-specific CD4 T cells are substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV infection in vitro. The lower HIV susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells is associated with the reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Phenotypic analyses show that ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells display a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 ( MIP-β ) but little IL-17. In contrast, Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells are highly susceptible to R5 HIV infection, with a mean p24+% of 26. 9%. In contrast, ALVAC-induced CD4 T cells in RV144 PBMC are markedly less susceptible to R5 HIV, with a mean p24+% of 1. 1%. These data suggest that the vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors manifest marked differences in their susceptibility to both R5 and X4 HIV infection in vitro, with ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells being less susceptible than Ad5 vector-specific CD4 T cells. Our data provide strong evidence for distinct HIV susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different vaccine vectors and highlight the importance of better evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.
The evolution of X inactivation strategies among therian mammals exhibits considerable diversity, ranging from strict paternally inherited X inactivation ( PXI ) to unbiased random X inactivation ( RXI ). PXI renders females haploid for all maternally inherited alleles, while RXI equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue. We present a theoretical population genetic analysis of X inactivation evolution and examine how conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence evolutionary trajectories of X inactivation. Our results indicate that a single interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a broad and continuous range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes. RXI is favored over complete PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive, and the criteria for RXI evolution is more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic relative to variation that is deleterious to both sexes. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness.
Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) is the first flavivirus found to be sensitive to the antiviral activity of human zinc-finger antiviral protein ( ZAP ). ZAP is a host factor that restricts the infection of many viruses through RNA degradation, translation inhibition, and innate immune responses. We investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP ( isoforms ZAP-L and ZAP-S ) against three flaviviruses: JEV, dengue virus ( DENV ), and Zika virus ( ZIKV ). Overexpression of ZAP blocked JEV infection but not DENV or ZIKV infection, and depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication. ZAP hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3′-5′ RNA exosome-mediated degradation. The zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. JEV 3′-untranslated region ( UTR ), especially in the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucleotide, was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to ZAP. Our data suggest that 3′-5′ RNA degradation by the exosome complex is involved in the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against JEV infection.
Rift Valley fever virus ( RVFV ) is a major human and animal pathogen that causes severe disease including hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis. The virus is endemic to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but there is significant concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and the potentially devastating effect on livestock populations with concurrent infections of humans. To date, there is little detailed data directly comparing the host response to infection with wild-type or vaccine strains of RVFV and correlation with viral pathogenesis. Here, we characterized clinical and systemic immune responses to infection with wild-type strain ZH501 or vaccine strain MP-12 in the C57BL/6 mouse. Animals infected with live-attenuated MP-12 survived productive viral infection with little evidence of clinical disease and minimal cytokine response in evaluated tissues. In contrast, ZH501 infection was lethal, caused depletion of lymphocytes and platelets and elicited a strong, systemic cytokine response which correlated with high virus titers and significant tissue pathology.
Chemotherapy-induced chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) is a major obstacle to the improvement of patient survival. Our results show that C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 ( CCL20 ) is significantly elevated during taxane-containing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with nonpathologic complete response. CCL20 promotes the self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells ( BCSCs ) through the activation of the p65 nuclear factor kappa B ( NF-κB ) pathway, significantly increasing the frequency and taxane resistance of BCSCs. Moreover, CCL20 promotes the expression of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 ( ABCB1 ) /multidrug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ), leading to the extracellular efflux of taxane. These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced CCL20 mediates chemoresistance via up-regulation of ABCB1. In addition, NF-κB activation increases CCL20 expression, forming a positive feedback loop between NF-κB and CCL20 pathways, which provides sustained impetus for chemoresistance in breast cancer cells. Our results suggest that CCL20 can be a novel predictive marker for taxane response, and the blockade of CCL20 or its downstream pathway might reverse the taxane resistance in breast cancer patients.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that can infect virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. Toxoplasma tachyzoites are able to infect and successfully manipulate their host by transporting “GRA” proteins from unique secretory organelles called dense granules into the host cell. These proteins have diverse roles in Toxoplasma’s intracellular lifecycle, including co-opting host cell functions and proteins such as the cell cycle, c-Myc and p38 MAP kinase. However, the translocation process of these proteins across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane ( PVM ) into the host cell is not well understood. We previously showed that TgMYR1, which is cleaved by TgASP5 into two fragments, localizes to the PVM and is essential for GRA transport into the host cell. To identify additional proteins necessary for effector transport, we screened Toxoplasma mutants defective in c-Myc up-regulation for their ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to the host cell nucleus. Here we report that novel proteins MYR2 and MYR3 play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host cell. These proteins are secreted into the PV space and co-localize with PV membranes and MYR1. We further show that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, consistent with a translocon-based model of effector transport. Overall, these results reveal a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell.
Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) and bovine papillomavirus ( BPV-1 ) E2 proteins bind to the origin recognition complex ( ORC ) subunit 2 ( ORC2 ). However, ORC2 is not present at the viral origin and its depletion does not suppress viral replication. Instead, ORC2 depletion increases the presence of E1 and E2 at the viral origin and enhances viral replication in a transient replication model and in keratinocytes stably maintaining viral episomes. In contrast, ORC2 depletion has no effect on viral copy number in a cell line with an integrated HPV genome. These data suggest that ORC2 is not necessary for activation of the viral origin by E1 and E2 but instead suppresses E2 replicative function. Furthermore, we observed that over-expression of HPV E2 decreases ORC2 occupation at two known mammalian origins of replication, suggesting that E2 restricts pre-ORC assembly that could otherwise compete for host replication complexes necessary for viral genome amplification. We infer that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral replication program and that elevated levels of E2 that occur during the differentiation dependent amplification stage subvert ORC loading and hence DNA synthesis at cellular origins.
Brucella DNA was detected in 10. 3% of 564 cow milk samples in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan by IS711-based real-time PCR. Brucella DNA was also detected in the milk of all seropositive cows, but 8. 3% of the seronegative cows also showed the presence of Brucella DNA. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggests that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was most likely infected with B. melitensis. This finding is concerning because consumption of unpasteurized dairy products is common in the region. The study highlights the need to further investigate whether there is a need for implementing complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programmes. In addition, vaccination of cattle with S19 in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1 might be needed to control Brucella infections in the livestock population.
Chromosome and genome stability are important for normal cell function, and instability often correlates with disease and dysfunction of DNA repair mechanisms. The pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis, transcriptionally repressed, and enriched with heterochromatic histone methylation marks, such as trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 or lysine 27 ( H3K9me3, H3K27me3 ). To elucidate the role of heterochromatin on genome stability in Z. tritici, we deleted the genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, kmt1 and kmt6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. We combined experimental evolution and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability, both in vitro and in planta. We used whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure, and differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. We found that H3K9me3 is important for the maintenance of genome stability because it disallows H3K27me3 in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. In this system, H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, generating a “metastable” state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome.
Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) is essential for preventing the fatal onset of rabies in individuals exposed to the virus. Unfortunately, life-saving vaccines and biologicals are often inaccessible and unaffordable to the poorest sectors of society who bear the largest burden of rabies. We evaluated the relative costs and benefits of different PEP vaccination regimens and found that PEP vaccination is an extremely cost-effective intervention, with costs ranging from $200 to less than $60 per death averted. Switching from intramuscular ( IM ) to intradermal ( ID ) administration of PEP was shown to result in significant savings in the volume of vaccine required to treat the same number of patients, which could mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce costs. We present financing mechanisms that could make PEP more affordable and accessible to those most in need, and support new and existing rabies control and prevention programs. We conclude that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP for bite victims, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths, as well as being economical for healthcare providers.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that replicates in mammalian cells within a parasitophorous vacuole ( PV ) that does not fuse with any host organelles. One mechanism by which the parasite acquires nutrients is by attracting host organelles to the PV. Here, we show that Toxoplasma exploits host lipid droplets ( LD ), ubiquitous fat storage organelles, for nutrient acquisition. We demonstrate that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells that are depleted of LD or impaired in TAG lipolysis or fatty acid catabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and the expression of host LD-associated genes ( ADRP, DGAT2 ) increase until the onset of parasite replication. Toxoplasma is capable of accessing lipids stored in host LD and incorporates these lipids into its own membranes and LD. To access LD-derived lipids, Toxoplasma intercepts and internalizes within the PV host LD, some of which remain associated with Rab7, which become wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes ( IVN ). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation display diminished capacity of lipid uptake from host LD. Moreover, parasites lacking an IVN-localized phospholipase A2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from host LD in the PV, suggesting a major contribution of the IVN for host LD processing in the PV and lipid content release.
FhCL3 and FhCL1 are key cysteine proteases secreted by the liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, which cause fasciolosis, an emerging zoonotic disease. Triclabendazole is the preferred drug to control fluke infections, but resistance has been reported in several countries. Here, we report the identification of chalcones as novel inhibitors of FhCL3 and FhCL1 using a comprehensive experimental and computational approach. We screened a library of 40 flavonoid derivatives and identified chalcones substituted with phenyl and naphthyl groups as potent inhibitors of FhCL3 and FhCL1. One compound, C34, was identified as a slow-reversible inhibitor of FhCL3 with an IC50 of 5. 6 μM. We demonstrated that C34 interacts with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key S2 and S3 pocket residues of FhCL3, determinants of the substrate specificity of this family of cysteine proteases. Interestingly, C34 induces a reduction in the ability of juvenile parasites to migrate through the gut wall and a loss of motility phenotype that leads to parasite death within a week in vitro, while it is not cytotoxic to bovine cells. These findings open new avenues for the development of novel agents to control fluke infection and possibly other helminthic diseases.
The visual system transmits information about fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. We used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells transmit these signals to the inner retina. We found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters. Individual cells transmit through multiple terminals varying in size, but smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher initial gain, followed by more profound adaptation. Smaller terminals transmitted higher stimulus frequencies more effectively. Modeling global calcium dynamics triggering vesicle release indicated that variations in the volume of presynaptic compartments contribute directly to all these differences in response dynamics. These results indicate how one neuron can transmit different temporal components in the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties.
Fluorescence microscopy ( FM ) and electron microscopy ( EM ) are used for single-synapse analysis. FM offers high speed and low cost, but rigorous discrimination between synaptic and non-synaptic fluorescence signals is challenging. In contrast, EM is the gold standard for reliable identification of a synapse, but offers limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To develop and test single-synapse image analysis methods, we have used datasets from conjugate array tomography ( cAT ), which provides voxel-conjugate FM and EM ( annotated ) images of the same individual synapses. We report a novel unsupervised probabilistic method for detection of synapses from multiplex FM ( muxFM ) image data, and evaluate this method both by comparison to EM gold standard annotated data and by examining its capacity to reproduce known important features of cortical synapse distributions. The proposed probabilistic model-based synapse detector accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries, and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. We show that our algorithm detects synapses from muxFM data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the muxFM data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density.
Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in many cellular processes, including nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune- and nervous system functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. Impairment of zinc homeostasis can lead to various human pathologies. Zinc transport in mammals is mediated by two transporter families, ZnT and ZIP, with ZnT2 playing a key role in vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion into breast milk during lactation. However, the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2 is currently unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that ZnT2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter with an apparent stoichiometry of two protons per zinc ion. We show that ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles is abolished by bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase, which alkalizes acidic vesicles. We further show that ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc leads to vesicular pH alkalization, which is reversed in the presence of TPEN, a specific zinc chelator. We propose that ZnT2 functions as an electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm.
Exonuclease 1 ( Exo1 ) is a protein involved in the processing of stalled replication forks in yeast and mammalian cells. Exo1 activity is regulated by checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events. We now identify 14-3-3 proteins as in vivo interaction partners of Exo1 in both yeast and mammalian cells. Yeast 14-3-3–deficient cells fail to induce Exo1 hyperphosphorylation and accumulate Exo1–dependent ssDNA gaps at stalled forks. This leads to persistent checkpoint activation and exacerbated recovery defects. Moreover, we show that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations using DNA bi-dimensional electrophoresis. We propose that 14-3-3 proteins assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Exo1 and additional unknown targets, promoting fork progression, stability, and restart in response to DNA replication stress. In yeast 14-3-3–deficient cells, the accumulation of Exo1–dependent ssDNA gaps is completely suppressed by EXO1 deletion. However, this does not reflect in suppression of HU sensitivity nor of defective fork progression in HU-treated 14-3-3 deficient cells. These data suggest that 14-3-3 proteins might regulate additional targets during replication stress, possibly through modulation of their phosphorylation.
The role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDC ) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) infection and pathogenesis remains unclear. We have developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes human pDC in all lymphoid organs in humanized mice. When pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1 infection, the induction of type I interferons ( IFN-I ) and interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) was abolished during acute HIV-1 infection. Consistent with the anti-viral role of IFN-I, HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. Interestingly, the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also severely reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1 induced depletion of human immune cells including T cells in lymphoid organs was reduced in spite of the increased viral replication. The increased cell number in lymphoid organs was associated with a reduced level of HIV-induced cell death in human leukocytes including CD4 T cells. We conclude that pDC play opposing roles in suppressing HIV-1 replication and in promoting HIV-1 induced immunopathogenesis. These findings suggest that pDC-depletion and IFN-I blockade will provide novel strategies for treating those HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment.
Sulforaphane ( SFN ), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to inhibit HIV infection in primary macrophages but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. SFN acts through the transcription regulator Nrf2, which is mobilized by SFN to reprogram cellular gene expression. In primary macrophages, SFN triggers a block to HIV infection that impacts the virus after reverse transcription but before 2-LTR circle formation. This block relies on Nrf2, which is a transcription regulator of anti-oxidant genes. Importantly, we found that macrophages express sufficient Nrf2 to maintain a partial restriction even in the absence of SFN. Depletion of Nrf2 with siRNA increased HIV infectivity in primary macrophages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SFN treatment. This supports a model in which anti-viral activity is mediated through Nrf2 after it is mobilized by SFN.
Geohelminth infections are common among pregnant women in rural western Kenya, with 76. 2% of 390 participants infected with at least one geohelminth species. The most prevalent species were Ascaris lumbricoides ( 52. 3% ), hookworm ( 39. 5% ), and Trichuris trichiura ( 29. 0% ). Infection with at least one geohelminth species was associated with the use of an unprotected water source ( adjusted odds ratio [ AOR ] 1. 8, 95% confidence interval [ CI ] 1. 1–3. 0 ) and the lack of treatment of drinking water ( AOR 1. 8, 95% CI 1. 1–3. 1 ). Hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid upper arm circumference ( adjusted mean decrease 0. 7 cm, 95% CI 0. 3–1. 2 cm ). Hookworm infections with an egg count ≥1000/gram feces ( 11 women ) were associated with lower hemoglobin ( adjusted mean decrease 1. 5 g/dl, 95% CI 0. 3–2. 7 ). Among gravidae 2 and 3, women with A. lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia ( OR 0. 4, 95% CI 0. 2–0. 8 ) compared to women without A. lumbricoides.
Mycolactone, a macrolide produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, displays anti-inflammatory effects on the nervous system. We investigated whether mycolactone affects the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, which are involved in pain perception, transmission, and maintenance. We found that mycolactone suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cells, without affecting their viability. Notably, mycolactone also prevented the pro-inflammatory polarization of cortical microglia, which contribute to neuroinflammation. We next tested if mycolactone impacts neuroinflammation in vivo using a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by chronic constriction of the sciatic nerve. Mycolactone was injected daily for 3 days in the spinal canal to ensure proper delivery to the spinal cord. While this treatment failed to prevent injury-induced neuroinflammation, it significantly decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without inducing detectable cytotoxicity. Our study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence that mycolactone suppresses the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia. Together with previous studies using peripheral blood leukocytes, our work suggests that mycolactone-mediated analgesia may be partially explained by its anti-inflammatory properties.
Human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ), a disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, has a range of clinical outcomes in its human host in West Africa, including an acute form progressing rapidly to second stage, spontaneous self-cure, and individuals able to regulate parasitaemia at very low levels. To investigate if host genetic determinants influence this clinical diversity, the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and HAT outcome was investigated in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea. A total of 425 individuals were included in the study, comprising 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with long lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology, and 114 endemic controls. Genotypes of 28 SNPs in eight genes were used for an association analysis. The study found that IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease ( p = 0. 0001, OR = 0. 39, CI95 = [0. 24–0. 63], BONF = 0. 0034 ). In contrast, MIF rs36086171 allele G was associated with an increased risk ( p = 0. 0239, OR = 1. 65, CI95 = [1. 07–2. 53], BONF = 0. 6697 ) and MIF rs12483859 C allele with latent infections ( p = 0. 0077, OR = 1. 86, CI95 = [1. 18–2. 95], BONF = 0. 2157 ). The study also confirmed earlier observations that APOL1 G2 allele ( DEL ) was associated with a higher risk of developing HAT ( p = 0. 0011, OR = 2. 70, CI95 = [1. 49–4. 91], BONF = 0. 0301 ) and APOL1 G1 polymorphism with a lower risk ( p = 0. 0005, OR = 0. 45, CI95 = [0. 29–0. 70], BONF = 0. 0129 ).
The Singapore Sequencing Indian Project ( SSIP ) has generated a publicly available genomic resource by sequencing the genomes of 38 South Asian Indians from Singapore at a target coverage of 30X. The genetic structure and diversity of these samples were compared against samples from the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project and populations in Phase 1 of the 1, 000 Genomes Project ( 1 KGP ). The SSIP samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio than other Asian populations. When compared against a panel of well-defined Asian Indians, the genetic makeup of the SSIP samples was closely related to South Indians. However, eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups that were predominantly present in Europeans and possessed higher European admixture than the remaining samples. An analysis of the relative relatedness between SSIP and two archaic hominins ( Denisovan, Neanderthal ) identified higher ancient admixture in East Asian populations than in SSIP. The data resource for these samples is expected to serve as a valuable complement to the South Asian samples in Phase 3 of 1 KGP.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides and macrolides due to the expression of the AmrAB-OprA efflux pump. We investigated the molecular basis of aminoglycoside susceptibility in Thai clinical isolates 708a, 2188a, and 3799a. We found that 708a lacked amrB transcripts, while 2188a and 3799a had greatly reduced levels of amrB. Serial passage of 2188a and 3799a on increasing gentamicin concentrations yielded mutants that were simultaneously resistant to other aminoglycosides and macrolides, whereas such mutants could not be obtained with 708a. Transcript analysis revealed that the resistance of the 2188a and 3799a mutants was due to upregulation of amrAB-oprA expression. In contrast, 708a lacked the amrAB-oprA operon due to a large deletion of more than 70 kb of genetic material. This deletion also removed the entire gene clusters for malleobactin and cobalamin synthesis, as well as the anaerobic arginine deiminase pathway, putative type 1 fimbriae, and secreted chitinase. Despite lacking several putative virulence genes, 708a was fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model.
During the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper ( Th ) cells into Th1 versus Th2 states, we observed that transcription factors Tbet and Gata3 are co-expressed in individual cells at high levels, which is distinct from basal-level co-expression during lineage priming. Contrary to the expectation of mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, we found that cytokines are expressed only in a small subpopulation of cells, independent from the expression of transcription factors in these single cells. This cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during the early phase of T helper cell differentiation is significantly larger than in the fully differentiated state. Upon inhibition of cytokine signaling, we observed the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, thus revealing a weak intracellular network otherwise overruled by the strong signals that emanate from extracellular cytokines. These results suggest that during the early differentiation process CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state, instructed by extracellular cytokines.
C. elegans PAQR-2, a transmembrane receptor homologous to mammalian insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors, is essential for adaptation to growth at 15°C, a low but usually acceptable temperature for this organism. By screening for novel paqr-2 suppressors, we identified mutations in genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis ( cept-1, pcyt-1 and sams-1 ) and fatty acid metabolism ( ech-7, hacd-1, mdt-15, nhr-49 and sbp-1 ). We show that paqr-2, phosphatidylcholines, sbp-1 and Δ9-desaturases form a cold adaptation pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to retain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This model is supported by the observations that the paqr-2 suppressors normalize the levels of saturated fatty acids, and that low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity can rescue the paqr-2 mutant.
Herpes simplex virus type-1 ( HSV-1 ) is a large and complex double-stranded DNA virus that causes a range of diseases from cold sores and chicken pox to congenital defects, blindness, and cancer. Despite extensive study, much remains to be learned about the structure of the genome packaging and release machinery in the capsids of herpesviruses. However, herpesviruses share a common evolutionary origin with tailed bacteriophages, which have well-characterized genome packaging and release machinery. In tailed bacteriophages, the genome exits from the virus particle through a portal and is transferred into the host cell by a complex apparatus located at the portal vertex. Here, we use electron cryo-tomography of HSV-1 virions to reveal a previously unsuspected feature at the portal vertex, which extends across the HSV-1 tegument layer to form a connection between the capsid and the viral membrane. The location of this assembly suggests that it plays a role in genome release into the nucleus and is also important for virion architecture.
Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen ( SEA ) and recombinant Omega-1 ( rω-1 ) have been shown to modulate induced CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses and HIV-1 infection in vitro. Here, we analyzed the effects of SEA on modulating HIV-1 infection and cytokine/chemokine production in vitro. We found that SEA, specifically through kappa-5, potently binds to DC-SIGN and blocks DC-SIGN mediated HIV-1 trans-infection ( p<0. 05 ), while not interfering with cis-infection. Furthermore, DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th2 promoting conditions induce a T-cell population that is less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection ( p<0. 05 ) compared to DCs unexposed to SEA. This effect was not observed for DCs exposed to SEA while maturing under Th1 or Th1/Th2 ( Tmix ) promoting conditions. We further show that DCs maturing under Tmix conditions exposed to rω-1 induce T-cell populations that are less sensitive to HIV-1 R5 infection ( p<0. 05 ), but not for X4 virus infection. This inhibition is associated with a reduction in IFN-γ and MIP-1β expression, and in the case of rω-1, also with reduced CCR5 expression.
Neuronal stimulation causes a ∼30% shrinkage of the extracellular space ( ECS ) between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in both grey and white matter under experimental conditions. Despite its potential implications for understanding basic aspects of potassium clearance and astrocyte function, the phenomenon remains unexplained. Here, we present a dynamic model that accounts for current experimental data related to the shrinkage phenomenon in wild-type as well as in gene knockout individuals. We find that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride in passive channels, action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and osmotically driven transport of water through the astrocyte membrane together seem sufficient for generating ECS shrinkage. However, when taking into account ECS and astrocyte ion concentrations observed in connection with neuronal stimulation, the actions of the Na+/K+/Cl− ( NKCC1 ) and the Na+/HCO3− ( NBC ) cotransporters appear to be critical determinants for achieving observed quantitative levels of ECS shrinkage.
Transcriptional silencing of transposons and repetitive DNA elements in eukaryotic genomes is mediated by the siRNA–mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this pathway, long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) produced by RNA Polymerase V ( Pol V ) guide ARGONAUTE4 ( AGO4 ) to chromatin and attract enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. We show that SPT5L/KTF1, a silencing factor and a homolog of SPT5 elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcriptional silencing. Chromatin binding of SPT5L/KTF1 occurs downstream of RNA Polymerase V, but independently from the presence of 24-nt siRNA. We also show that SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other. Binding of both AGO4 and SPT5L/KTF1 is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications of several loci. We propose that the coordinate binding of SPT5L and AGO4 creates a platform for direct or indirect recruitment of chromatin modifying enzymes.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease, requires the alternative sigma factor RpoS for dissemination within the vector during tick-to-mammal transmission. We demonstrate that RpoS-dependent gene expression is essential for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs, as RpoS-deficient organisms are confined to the midgut lumen and transform into an unusual morphotype ( round bodies ) during the later stages of the blood meal. Round body formation is rapidly reversible and appears to be attributable, in part, to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, which provides NAD+ for glycolysis. Our data suggest that spirochetes default to an RpoS-independent program for round body formation upon sensing that the energetics for transmission are unfavorable. We show that RpoS is induced during the nymphal blood meal but is not expressed by spirochetes within replete larvae or unfed nymphs, thereby delineating the RpoS ON ( fed nymph ) and OFF ( fed larvae and unfed nymph ) states during the tick phase of the enzootic cycle. Our findings reveal a previously unsuspected role for RpoSBb in the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission as well as the existence of a proposed default survival mode ( round body formation ) triggered when spirochetes are unable to produce sufficient energy for dissemination within the nymph.
Deficiency in gibberellin ( GA ) and jasmonate ( JA ) causes male sterility in Arabidopsis, but little is known about the relationship between GA and JA in controlling stamen development. Here, we show that MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57 are GA-dependent stamen-enriched genes. Loss-of-function of two DELLAs, RGA and RGL2, restores the expression of these three MYB genes together with restoration of stamen filament growth in GA-deficient plants. Genetic analysis shows that the myb21-t1 myb24-t1 myb57-t1 triple mutant confers a short stamen phenotype leading to male sterility. Further genetic and molecular studies demonstrate that GA suppresses DELLAs to mobilize the expression of the key JA biosynthesis gene DAD1, and this is consistent with the observation that the JA content in the young flower buds of the GA-deficient quadruple mutant ga1-3 gai-t6 rga-t2 rgl1-1 is much lower than that in the WT. We conclude that GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57. Therefore, we have established a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in that modulation of JA pathway by GA is one of the prerequisites for GA to regulate normal stamen development in Arabidopsis.
Dietary restriction ( DR ) has been shown to extend lifespan in various species and slow the onset of age-related diseases. Previous studies have implicated the target of rapamycin ( TOR ) pathway in longevity phenotypes resulting from DR. TOR is a conserved protein kinase that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients and growth factors. Here, we describe a novel role for hypoxia inducible factor-1 ( HIF-1 ) in modulating lifespan extension by DR in Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan, which overlaps with that by inhibition of the RSKS-1/S6 kinase, a key component of the TOR pathway. Using a modified DR method based on variation of bacterial food concentrations on solid agar plates, we find that HIF-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner. The hif-1 loss-of-function mutant extends lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but fails to show lifespan extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, which increases HIF-1 activity, diminishes the lifespan extension under DR. This deficiency is rescued by tissue-specific expression of egl-9 in specific neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by hif-1 or DR is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 ( IRE-1 ) and is associated with lower levels of ER stress.
Keratinocytes are a type of skin cell that can transition between different functional states, such as differentiation and migration. These transitions are accompanied by changes in chromatin, the complex of DNA, histone proteins, and other non-histone proteins that make up chromatin. Here, we show that when keratinocytes differentiate or migrate, they form unique complements of enhancers and super-enhancers that are specific to each state. Enhancers are regions of chromatin that regulate gene expression, and super-enhancers are a subset of enhancers that are highly active. These super-enhancers link to gene expression that confers functions associated with the respective cell state. We also show that GRHL3, a transcription factor that promotes both differentiation and migration, binds preferentially to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters in migrating keratinocytes, where it represses the expression of genes that inhibit migration. Furthermore, GRHL3 regulates the formation of super-enhancers, including the suppression of non-keratinocyte super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes. Our studies suggest that GRHL3 regulates divergent gene expression programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes by switching locations of chromatin binding in the context of enhancer landscapes that are distinct for each state.
Endogenous retroviruses ( ERVs ) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections of the host germline that have been transmitted vertically from generation to generation. It has been hypothesized that some ERVs are used by the host as restriction factors to block the infection of pathogenic retroviruses. Using sheep as a model system, we investigated the evolutionary interplay between endogenous retroviruses, exogenous retroviruses, and their hosts. We isolated and characterized the evolutionary history and molecular virology of 27 enJSRV proviruses, which have been integrating in the host genome for the last 5–7 million years. Two enJSRV proviruses, enJS56A1 and enJSRV-20, which entered the host genome within the last 3 million years, acquired a defective Gag polyprotein resulting in a transdominant phenotype able to block late replication steps of related exogenous retroviruses. Both transdominant proviruses became fixed in the host genome before or around sheep domestication ( ∼ 9, 000 years ago ). Interestingly, a provirus escaping the transdominant enJSRVs has emerged very recently, most likely within the last 200 years. This study strongly suggests that endogenization and selection of ERVs acting as restriction factors is a mechanism used by the host to fight retroviral infections.
Schistosomiasis diagnosis currently relies on microscopic detection of schistosome eggs in stool or urine samples and serological assays. However, the poor sensitivity of standard microscopic procedures performed in routine laboratories makes molecular detection methods of increasing interest. We evaluated two in-house real-time Schistosoma PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium in excreta, biopsies, and sera as potential tools to diagnose active infections and monitor treatment efficacy. We performed Schistosoma PCRs on 412 samples from patients with suspected schistosomiasis, before anti-parasitic treatment, and compared the results to microscopic examination and serological assays. Compared to microscopy, PCRs significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis, from 4% to 10. 5% and from 33. 7% to 48. 8%, for Sh in urine and Sm in stools, respectively. The overall sensitivity of PCR on serum samples was 72. 7% and reached 94. 1% in patients with positive excreta ( microscopy ). The specificity of serum PCR was 98. 9%. After treatment, serum PCR positivity rates slowly declined from 93. 8% at day 30 to 8. 3% at day 360, whereas antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. Schistosoma PCRs clearly outperform standard microscopy on stools and urine and could be part of reference methods combined with WB-based serology, which remains a gold standard for initial diagnosis.
In this study, we demonstrate that machine learning ( ML ) can be used to estimate the conformational energies of large, structurally complex molecules. We take the natural product Archazolid A, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase, from the myxobacterium Archangium gephyra, as an example. We use Gaussian process regression, a Bayesian non-parametric ML method, to model the relationship between the molecular structure of Archazolid A and its quantum mechanical ( QM ) properties. We use a simple molecular representation based on nuclear charges and inter-atomic distances to encode the conformations of Archazolid A. This representation is sensitive to structural variations in relaxed geometries and enables finding correlations between simulated conformations and computed energy values at the density functional theory ( DFT ) level of theory. We achieve mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol for energies of relaxed conformations at the DFT/BLYP-disp3/def2-TZVP level of theory. This study demonstrates that predictive ML models can be developed for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, potentially enabling considerable speed-ups in simulations of larger molecular structures.
Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) is a major public health concern in Central Africa, where it has caused recent declines in resident great ape populations. While vaccines have been proposed as an intervention to protect apes, their effectiveness would be improved if we could diagnostically confirm EVD as the cause of die-offs, establish ebolavirus geographical distribution, identify immunologically naïve populations, and determine whether apes survive virus exposure. Here, we report the first successful noninvasive detection of antibodies against Ebola virus ( EBOV ) from wild ape feces. Using this method, we have been able to identify gorillas with antibodies to EBOV with an overall prevalence rate reaching 10% on average, demonstrating that EBOV exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Furthermore, evidence of antibodies was identified in gorillas thought previously to be unexposed to EBOV. Our new approach will contribute to a strategy to protect apes from future EBOV infections by early detection of increased incidence of exposure, by identifying immunologically naïve at-risk populations as potential targets for vaccination, and by providing a means to track vaccine efficacy if such intervention is deemed appropriate.
Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria ( Xcv ) is a plant pathogenic bacterium that causes disease in tomato and pepper plants. Here, we show that the novel type III effector XopL exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta. This activity is associated with the C-terminal region of XopL, which specifically interacts with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates formation of predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of the XopL C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in any previously characterized E3 ligase. Mutation of amino acids in the central cavity of the XL-box disrupts E3 ligase activity and prevents XopL-induced plant cell death. The crystal structure of the N-terminal region of XopL confirmed the presence of a leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain, which may serve as a protein-protein interaction module for ubiquitination target recognition. While the E3 ligase activity is required to provoke plant cell death, suppression of PAMP responses solely depends on the N-terminal LRR domain. The unique structural fold of the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain within the Xanthomonas XopL is unprecedented and highlights the variation in bacterial pathogen effectors mimicking this eukaryote-specific activity.
HIV-infected individuals in the early stages of acute infection ( stage 1/2 ) and late acute infection ( stage 3 ) were studied in the RV254 cohort to investigate T helper-B cell responses and the impact of early antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) on T and B cell function. Circulating T follicular helper cells ( cTfh ) from this cohort were examined, and cTfh and memory B cell populations were phenotyped. We found that cTfh cell function was impaired in individuals treated in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, and cTfh/B cell cocultures showed lower B cell survival and IgG secretion at stage 3 compared to stage 1/2. This coincided with lower IL-10 and increased RANTES and TNF-α, suggesting a role for inflammation in altering cTfh and B cell responses. Elevated plasma viral load in stage 3 was found to correlate with decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production, indicating a role for increased viremia in cTfh impairment and dysfunctional humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were also evident in the mature B cell compartment, most notably a decrease in resting memory B cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with higher viremia. Overall, cTfh-mediated B cell responses are significantly altered in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, coinciding with increased inflammation and a reduction in memory B cells.
Schistosomiasis is a tropical parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. Current therapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel ( PZQ ), which has several suboptimal features. To develop next generation anthelmintics, it is essential to identify and pharmacologically profile physiologically relevant targets. Here, we report the pharmacological profiling of a schistosome serotonergic G protein-coupled receptor ( Sm. 5HTR ) in a miniaturized screening assay compatible with high content screening. We employed a split luciferase based biosensor sensitive to cellular cAMP levels to resolve the proximal kinetics of GPCR modulation in intact cells. Our data evidence a divergent pharmacological signature between Sm. 5HTR and the closest human GPCR homolog ( Hs. 5HTR7 ), supporting the feasibility of optimizing parasitic selective pharmacophores. New ligands and chemical series with potency and selectivity for Sm. 5HTR over Hs. 5HTR7 were identified in vitro and validated for in vivo efficacy against schistosomules and adult worms. Furthermore, Sm. 5HTR displayed a property resembling irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon also observed at Hs. 5HTR7, which enhances the appeal of this abundantly expressed parasite GPCR as a target for anthelmintic ligand design. Overall, these data underscore the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in a high throughput screening format and the promise of Sm. 5HTR as a chemotherapeutically vulnerable node for development of next generation anthelmintics.
The separation of germ layers during embryonic development is crucial for the establishment of the metazoan body plan. In this process, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm must be separated, yet the ectoderm must also serve as a substratum for mesoderm migration. We show that localized detachment of cells at the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary, resulting from contact-induced signals, is at the core of ectoderm-mesoderm segregation. This process involves ephrinB/EphB signaling, with multiple ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors expressed on each side of the boundary. Forward signaling across the boundary in both directions, involving partially redundant ligands and receptors, and activation of Rac and RhoA, is required for tissue separation. This mechanism differs from a simple differential adhesion process of germ layer formation. Instead, it involves localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle that allows for cell migration across a cellular substratum.
The number of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has increased dramatically over the last four decades. However, the underlying pathophysiology of ASD is still not well understood, and diagnosis is currently based on behavioral observations and psychometric tools. To address this limitation, we analyzed metabolite concentrations of the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways from blood samples of 83 children with ASD and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers. We used Fisher Discriminant Analysis to classify participants as on the spectrum or neurotypical, resulting in 96. 1% of neurotypical participants and 97. 6% of the ASD cohort being correctly identified. Furthermore, we used kernel partial least squares to predict adaptive behavior, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score, and found that measurement of five metabolites of the pathways was sufficient to predict the Vineland score with an R2 of 0. 45 after cross-validation. This level of accuracy far exceeds any other approach in this field and suggests that the metabolites under consideration are strongly correlated with an ASD diagnosis and that the statistical analysis used here offers tremendous potential for extracting important information from complex biochemical data sets.
Leishmaniasis is endemic in 98 countries with 350 million people at risk and approximately 2 million cases annually. Brazil is one of the most severely affected countries. We applied Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models to analyze reported incidence data of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil covering a 10-year period ( 2001–2010 ). The models were fitted using integrated nested Laplace approximations to perform fast approximate Bayesian inference. Bayesian variable selection was employed to determine the most important climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis. For both types of leishmaniasis, precipitation and socioeconomic proxies were identified as important risk factors. The predicted number of cases in 2010 were 30, 189 ( standard deviation [SD]: 7, 676 ) for cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4, 889 ( SD: 288 ) for visceral leishmaniasis. Our risk maps predicted the highest numbers of infected people in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively. Our spatially explicit, high-resolution incidence maps identified priority areas where leishmaniasis control efforts should be targeted with the ultimate goal to reduce disease incidence.
Dengue patients admitted to a single hospital in southern Vietnam were studied to compare clinical and laboratory features, management, and outcome between adults and children. The study included 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue. We found that signs of vascular leakage and shock were more frequent and severe in children than in adults, while bleeding manifestations and organ involvement were more common in adults. Additionally, adults experienced significantly more severe thrombocytopenia. Secondary infection was independently associated with greater thrombocytopenia, although with a smaller effect than age-group. The effect of age-group on platelet count was also apparent in the values obtained several weeks after recovery, indicating that healthy adults have intrinsically lower platelet counts compared to children.
Sooty mangabeys ( SM ) are natural hosts of the simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIVsmm ), which causes a non-pathogenic infection despite robust virus replication. We identified a novel SM CCR5 allele containing a two base pair deletion ( Δ2 ) that encodes a truncated molecule not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIVsmm entry in vitro. This allele was present in 26% of a large SM colony, along with a 3% frequency of a CCR5Δ24 deletion allele that also abrogates surface expression. Overall, 8% of animals were homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles and 41% were heterozygous. The prevalence of natural SIVsmm infection was not significantly different in animals lacking functional CCR5 compared to heterozygous and homozygous wild-type animals. SIVsmm primary isolates infected both homozygous mutant and wild-type PBMC in a CCR5-independent manner in vitro, and Envs from both CCR5-null and wild-type infected animals used CXCR6, GPR15 and GPR1 in addition to CCR5 in transfected cells. These data indicate that SIVsmm relies on CCR5-independent entry pathways in SM that are homozygous for defective CCR5 alleles and suggest that SIVsmm tropism and host cell targeting in vivo is defined by the distribution and use of alternative entry pathways in addition to CCR5.
MEF2 transcription factors (TFs) have a dual role in the tumorigenic process: they can act as transcriptional activators or repressors depending on their interaction with co-activators or co-repressors. In leiomyosarcomas ( LMS ), a rare soft tissue sarcoma, MEF2 supports both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities depending on the presence of class IIa histone deacetylases ( HDACs ). Class IIa HDACs are overexpressed in approximately 22% of LMS, where high levels of MEF2, HDAC4, and HDAC9 inversely correlate with overall survival. In LMS cells, MEF2 is under the control of the ubiquitin-proteasome system ( UPS ), and its ablation reduces the expression of MEF2-target genes and enhances the transformed phenotype. In contrast, in LMS cells where HDAC9 is highly expressed, MEF2 is required for tumorigenesis and to repress the transcription of some MEF2-target genes. HDAC9 also coordinates the demethylation of H3K4me3 at the promoters of MEF2-target genes. Overall, our results suggest that class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, are druggable targets for a therapeutic intervention in LMS.
Hydrophobins are a group of proteins produced by filamentous fungi that play an important role in their ability to affect their environment and promote growth. They are also of interest in nanotechnology due to their unique properties at interfaces. In this study, we have used a combination of protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy to gain insight into the surface structure of films composed of two class II hydrophobins: HFBI and HFBII produced by Trichoderma reesei. Our results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins with P6 symmetry. However, our experimental results show P3 symmetry with a unit cell size of 56 Å. We also propose an alternate ordering with a three protein unit cell with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit cell size. Using a Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydrophobin film, we show how this alternate metastable structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films. This may indicate a mechanism of more general significance to both biology and nanotechnology.
Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, is a protozoan parasite for which there is an urgent need for new therapeutic targets. Here, we report the functional characterization of L. donovani threonyl tRNA synthetase ( LdThrRS ), a central enzyme required for protein synthesis. We expressed and purified recombinant LdThrRS ( rLdThrRS ) in E. coli and determined its kinetic parameters. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that LdThrRS is possibly localized to both the cytosol and mitochondria. We generated heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS in Leishmania promastigotes, which showed a restrictive growth phenotype and attenuated infectivity. These mutants were also more susceptible to inhibition by the known ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin. Several attempts to obtain LdThrRS homozygous null mutants were unsuccessful, indicating that LdThrRS is essential for L. donovani survival. Borrelidin showed a strong affinity for LdThrRS ( KD: 0. 04 μM ) and was effective in inhibiting the aminoacylation activity of rLdThrRS ( IC50: 0. 06 μM ). Furthermore, borrelidin inhibited the promastigotes ( IC50: 21 μM ) stage of parasites. Our data suggests that LdThrRS is essential for L. donovani survival and is likely to bind with small drug-like molecules with strong affinity, thus making it a potential target for drug discovery efforts.
Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA is recognized as non-self by the innate immune protein RIG-I through the presence of a 5′-triphosphate ( 5′-ppp ) on the viral RNA in association with a 3′ poly-U/UC tract. Here we define the HCV PAMP and the criteria for RIG-I non-self discrimination of HCV by examining the RNA structure-function attributes that impart PAMP function to the poly-U/UC tract. We found that the 34 nucleotide poly-uridine “core” of this sequence tract was essential for RIG-I activation, and that interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides between poly-U sequences in the RNA were required to achieve optimal RIG-I signal induction. Importantly, HCV poly-U/UC RNA variants that strongly activated RIG-I signaling triggered potent anti-HCV responses in vitro and hepatic innate immune responses in vivo using a mouse model of PAMP signaling. Our studies define a multi-motif PAMP signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I that incorporates a 5′-ppp with poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This HCV PAMP motif drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection.
Eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, have been found to support the growth of the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis in the host's skeletal muscle. This effect is mediated by the cytokine interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ), which is produced by eosinophils. Our results indicate that IL-4 and eosinophils are necessary for normal larval growth and that eosinophils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth. This effect operates in the absence of adaptive immunity. Following invasion by newborn larvae, host gene expression in skeletal muscle is compatible with a regenerative response and a shift in the source of energy in infected tissue. The presence of eosinophils suppresses local inflammation while also influencing nutrient homeostasis in muscle. We found evidence for pathway activation and GLUT4 translocation in infected muscle cells, which supports a mechanism in which eosinophil-derived IL-4 promotes muscle larval growth directly by enhancing glucose uptake in host cells. Our results are consistent with a mechanism in which larval growth is supported when eosinophils, or eosinophil-derived IL-4, limits STAT1 signaling that otherwise would inhibit glucose and lipid metabolism in muscle.
Genome-wide replication timing studies have suggested that mammalian chromosomes consist of megabase-scale domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless transition regions. However, we report a quantitative genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in HeLa cells that contradicts this view. DNA combing in HeLa cells sorted into four temporal compartments of S phase shows that replication origins are spaced at 40 kb intervals and fire as small clusters whose synchrony increases during S phase. Replication fork velocity remains constant and narrowly distributed through S phase. Analysis of a genome-wide replication timing profile shows a broad distribution of replication timing gradients with practically no regions larger than 100 kb replicating at less than 2 kb/min. Therefore, HeLa cells lack large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Temporal transition regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at a rate that increases during S phase and replication timing gradients are set by the delay and the spacing between successive origin firings rather than by the velocity of single forks.
Slowness is proposed as an objective for spike-timing–dependent plasticity ( STDP ) in the nervous system. This approach exploits the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise. We show that slow feature analysis ( SFA ), an algorithm that is based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons by means of a modified Hebbian learning rule. This approach provides a link to the trace rule, another implementation of slowness learning. We then show analytically that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by STDP with a specific learning window. By studying the learning dynamics of STDP, we show that for functional interpretations of STDP, it is not the learning window alone that is relevant but rather the convolution of the learning window with the postsynaptic potential ( EPSP ). We derive STDP learning windows that implement SFA and the “trace rule. ” The resulting learning windows are compatible with physiological data both in shape and timescale. Moreover, our analysis shows that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics, respectively.
Cancer cells in heterogeneous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tumors can develop resistance to therapy through a previously unrecognized behavior called cooperative adaptation to therapy ( CAT ), in which cancer cells induce co-resistant phenotypes in neighboring cancer cells when exposed to cancer therapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit, we engineered phenotypically diverse NSCLC cells by conferring mutations in Dicer1, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small non-coding RNA genesis. We monitored three-dimensional growth dynamics of fluorescently-labeled mutant and/or wild-type cells individually or in co-culture using a substrate-free NanoCulture system under unstimulated or drug pressure conditions. By integrating mathematical modeling with flow cytometry, we characterized the growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a mathematical model of intra- and interspecies competition. We found that the combination of WT and mutants in co-cultures allowed for beneficial growth in previously drug sensitive cells despite drug pressure via induction of cell state transitions described by a cooperative game theoretic change in the fitness values. We also used an ex vivo human tumor model that predicts clinical response through drug sensitivity analyses and determined that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates to prognostic failure of multiple clinically-approved and off-label drugs in individual NSCLC patient samples. These findings present a new paradox in drug resistance implicating non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells to thwart drug pressure, suggesting that profiling for druggable targets ( i. e. mutations ) alone may be insufficient to assign effective therapy.
Spotted fever group ( SFG ) rickettsioses are endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, but the burden of disease, risk factors, and transmission patterns are not well described. A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted in Mbeya Region, Southwestern Tanzania, to estimate the seroprevalence of IgG antibodies against SFG rickettsiae and to assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. A total of 1, 228 persons above the age of 5 years were randomly selected from nine participating communities, stratified by age, altitude of residence, and ownership of domestic mammals. The seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae was found to be 67. 9% ( range among nine sites: 42. 8–91. 4% ). Multivariable analysis revealed associations with age ( prevalence ratio per 10 years: 1. 08; 95% CI 1. 06–1. 10 ), warmer temperatures ( prevalence ratio per °C: 1. 38; 1. 11–1. 71 ), male gender ( prevalence ratio 1. 08; 1. 00–1. 16 ), and low population density ( prevalence ratio per 1, 000 persons/km² increase: 0. 96; 0. 94–0. 99 ). At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence.
Oleate, a monounsaturated fatty acid, is required for innate immune activation and pathogen defense in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We identified the two stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturases that synthesize oleate in C. elegans and show that the synthesis of oleate is necessary for the pathogen-mediated induction of immune defense genes. C. elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse human pathogens, which can be rescued by the addition of exogenous oleate. However, oleate is not sufficient to drive protective immune activation. We show that the effect of oleate on innate immune activation is distinct from the effects of two polyunsaturated fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid, which are required for the basal expression of innate immune effectors. Our data indicate that oleate and these polyunsaturated fatty acids affect immune effector expression and pathogen resistance by different mechanisms.
Riboswitches are regulatory elements that modulate gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding. Guanine riboswitches are involved in the regulation of purine metabolite transport and biosynthesis, which are critical for the cellular pool of nucleotides. Upon guanine binding, these riboswitches stabilize a 5′-untranslated mRNA structure that causes transcription attenuation of the downstream open reading frame. We have identified a pyrimidine compound ( PC1 ) that binds to guanine riboswitches and exhibits bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens. This activity is only achieved when the guaA gene, which codes for a GMP synthetase, is under the control of the riboswitch. PC1 targets a different metabolic pathway, as it inhibits several clinical strains exhibiting multiple drug resistance. In a mouse model, we have shown a direct correlation between the administration of PC1 and the reduction of Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands. This work establishes the possibility of using existing structural knowledge to design novel guanine riboswitch-targeting antibiotics as powerful and selective antimicrobial compounds.
In the present study, we investigated how gaze informs the construction of mental space during wayfinding in macaque monkeys navigating a virtual reality maze for a reward. We found that hippocampal cells responded to one or more variables such as head direction, point of gaze, or task context. Many cells fired at the sight ( and in anticipation ) of a single landmark in a viewpoint- or task-dependent manner, simultaneously encoding the animal’s logical situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Overall, hippocampal activity was best fit by a fine-grained state space comprising current position, view, and action contexts. Our findings indicate that counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in the construction of space. We show that space representation in primates embodies self-position with respect to the target of gaze and further carries cognitive information with respect to the current trajectory to a goal. Our data suggest that the counterpart of place cells in primates, as compared to rodents, is expressed as activity related to point of gaze in conjunction with other variables essential to navigation, such as position and identity of visual elements at key instants of trajectory planning.
During vertebrate development, the mid-hindbrain boundary ( MHB ) is established and maintained by a regulatory network between several transcription and secreted factors. We show that a Boolean analysis of the spatial gene expression patterns at the murine MHB reveals key regulatory interactions in this network. Our analysis predicts a maintaining, rather than inducing, effect of Fgf8 on Wnt1 expression, which we experimentally validate using mouse anterior neural plate/tube explant cultures. We show that Fgf8 only maintains but does not induce ectopic Wnt1 expression in these explants. In combination with previously validated interactions, this finding allows for the construction of a regulatory network between key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB. Analyses of Boolean, differential equation and reaction-diffusion models of this network confirm that it is able to explain the stable maintenance of the MHB as well as time-courses of expression patterns both under wild-type and various knock-out conditions. We demonstrate that similar to temporal also spatial expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks. We show that the spatial gene expression patterns around the MHB help us to understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level.
Theileria annulata is an apicomplexan parasite that transforms infected host cells by inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of the parasitized cell population. Shortly after sporozoite entry into the target cell, the parasite develops into the transforming schizont, which remains tethered to host cell microtubules ( MTs ) and engages the cell's astral and central spindle MTs to secure its distribution between the two daughter cells during mitosis and cytokinesis. The molecular mechanism by which the schizont recruits and stabilizes host cell MTs is not known. We now report that the schizont recruits end-binding protein 1 ( EB1 ), a central component of the MT plus end protein interaction network and key regulator of host cell MT dynamics. The schizont surface protein p104 functions as a genuine EB1-binding protein and can recruit EB1 in the absence of any other parasite proteins. Binding strictly depends on a consensus SxIP motif located in a highly disordered C-terminal region of p104. We further show that parasite interaction with host cell EB1 is cell cycle regulated. This is the first description of a pathogen-encoded protein to interact with EB1 via a bona-fide SxIP motif. Our findings provide important new insight into the mode of interaction between Theileria and the host cell cytoskeleton.
Telomeres are the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division. In this study, we investigated how telomere length is regulated in response to DNA damage in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that a mutation in the replicative ligase Cdc9 results in a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, and longer telomeres. This telomere lengthening requires functional telomerase, the core DNA damage signaling cascade Mec1-Rad9-Rad53, and the components of the break-induced replication ( BIR ) repair pathway. We also found that the Mec1-Rad53 induced phosphorylation of Pif1 is important for the role of Pif1 in BIR and telomere elongation in cdc9-1 cells. We propose that the passage of BIR forks through telomeres promotes telomerase activity and leads to telomere lengthening. In addition, we suggest that the DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of Pif1 promotes potentially telomere-stabilizing telomere extension while repressing deleterious de novo telomere addition events at DNA breaks.
Onchocerciasis, an infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus, is a major public health concern due to its debilitating symptoms and concerns about recrudescence in areas of previous control. To improve diagnosis and monitoring of control measures, we investigated whether luciferase immunoprecipitation systems ( LIPS ) may be used as a more rapid, specific, and standardized diagnostic assay for Onchocerca volvulus infection. We tested four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens ( Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1, and Ov-CPI-1 ) on a large cohort of blinded sera comprised of both uninfected controls and patients with a proven parasitic infection, including Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, Strongyloides stercoralis, and other potentially cross-reactive infections. We found that antibody responses to the four different Onchocerca volvulus antigens allowed for unequivocal differentiation between Onchocerca volvulus-infected and uninfected control sera with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We also found that antibody titers to each of these four antigens in individual Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera were markedly different and did not correlate with each other. The simplified method of using a mixture of the four Onchocerca volvulus antigens simultaneously in the standard format or a quick 15-minute format ( QLIPS ) showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera.
Anemia, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and soil transmitted helminth infections are prevalent among women of reproductive age in resource-constrained settings. A 54-month population-based program of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming was implemented in a rural population of women in northern Vietnam to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing anemia, iron deficiency, iron deficiency anemia, and soil transmitted helminth infections, and to identify predictive factors for hematological outcomes. A total of 389 women aged 16–45 years were enrolled just prior to the intervention. After 54 months, 76% of the participants were taking the iron-folic acid supplement and 95% had taken the most recently distributed deworming treatment. The mean hemoglobin level rose from 122 g/L to 131 g/L and anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18%. Iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8% and iron deficiency anemia was reduced to 4%. The prevalence of hookworm infection was reduced from 76% to 11% and the level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%.
Herpesviruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ), have evolved immune evasion strategies to persist in the face of cell-mediated immunity. EBV gp150 is a novel, broadly acting immunoevasin that inhibits antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and the non-classical, lipid-presenting CD1d molecules. gp150 is expressed during the late phase of viral replication and is heavily glycosylated, creating a shield that impedes surface presentation of antigen. This is an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses. The mechanism of gp150-mediated T-cell escape does not depend on degradation of the antigen-presenting molecules nor does it require gp150’s cytoplasmic tail. Importantly, B cells infected with a gp150-null mutant EBV displayed rescued levels of surface antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA class II, and CD1d, supporting an important role for iNKT cells next to classical T cells in fighting EBV infection. Our results indicate that EBV gp150 prolongs the timespan for producing viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral life cycle.
The actin binding domain of the translocated actin recruiting phosphoprotein ( Tarp ) is a conserved feature among all pathogenic chlamydial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells. Tarp is capable of nucleating actin polymerization independently of host factors in vitro. Sequence analysis of Tarp orthologs from multiple chlamydial species and C. trachomatis serovars revealed multiple putative actin binding sites and variable numbers of functional actin binding domains. Chlamydial Tarps from Caviae, C. muridarum, and various C. trachomatis serovars were capable of nucleating actin filament formation in vitro. A peptide antiserum specific for the Tarp actin binding domain inhibited Tarp mediated actin nucleation and reduced host cell susceptibility to chlamydial infection in vivo. Our findings indicate that Tarp mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chlamydial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells.
Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic disease with a number of mammalian species acting as reservoir hosts, including water buffaloes, which can contribute up to 75% to human transmission in the People's Republic of China. Accurate determination of prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma japonicum in mammalian hosts is important for calculating transmission rates and determining environmental contamination. A new procedure, the formalin–ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion ( FEA–SD ) technique, has been developed for increased visualization of S. japonicum eggs in bovine feces. This technique involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy. The FEA–SD technique removes nearly 70% of debris from fecal samples, rendering the remaining debris translucent and allowing improved microscopic visualization of S. japonicum eggs. This method provides an accurate quantitative method for estimating infection in bovines and other ruminant reservoir hosts. We show that the FEA-SD technique is as efficient as real-time PCR ( qPCR ) for determining schistosome prevalence in bovines but is less costly to implement.
Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage associated protein ( CRTAP ) and prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 ( P3H1 ) are the first identified causes of recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta ( OI ). These proteins, together with cyclophilin B ( encoded by PPIB ), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline residue on the α1 ( I ) chain ( Pro986 ) and has cis/trans isomerase ( PPIase ) activity essential for proper collagen folding. Recent data suggest that prolyl 3-hydroxylation of Pro986 is not required for the structural stability of collagen; however, the absence of this post-translational modification may disrupt protein-protein interactions integral for proper collagen folding and lead to collagen over-modification. We generated knock-in mice carrying a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic site of P3h1 ( Lepre1H662A ). This substitution abolished P3h1 activity but retained ability to form a complex with Crtap and thus the collagen chaperone function. Knock-in mice showed absence of prolyl 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of the α1 ( I ) and α1 ( II ) collagen chains but no significant over-modification at other collagen residues. They were normal in appearance, had no growth defects and normal cartilage growth plate histology but showed decreased trabecular bone mass. This new mouse model recapitulates elements of the bone phenotype of OI but not the cartilage and growth phenotypes caused by loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. Our observations suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of P3H1 hydroxylase activity versus complete ablation of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex.
Drosophila simulans, a species closely related to Drosophila melanogaster, has recently been invaded by the P-element, a selfish genetic element that causes hybrid dysgenesis. Hybrid dysgenesis is a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes, including sterility, that occurs in the offspring of crosses between strains carrying the P-element. Here, we report a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years, and show that this phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element. We surveyed 181 D. simulans strains and found that around 20% of strains induce hybrid dysgenesis. Using genomic and transcriptomic data, we show that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the presence of the P-element. We also surveyed 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element, and found that the invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed. Strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype.
Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, is a major public health concern. The male-based sterile insect technique ( SIT ) and incompatible insect technique ( IIT ) have been proposed to control Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus populations. However, there is a need for an economical and rapid diagnostic tool to determine the dispersion and mating success of sterilized males in the wild. Here, we report on the use of rhodamine B to mark the body and seminal fluid of male Ae. aegypti for mark-release-recapture experiments and estimating the efficacy of sterile male releases. Rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, was administered to males via sugar-feeding and produced >95% transfer to females and successful body marking after 4 days of feeding. Importantly, rhodamine B marking had no effect on male mating competitiveness and proof-of-principle field releases demonstrated successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females under field conditions and recapture of marked males. These results reveal rhodamine B to be a potentially useful evaluation method for male-based SIT/IIT control strategies as well as a viable body marking technique for male-based mark-release-recapture experiments without the negative side-effects of traditional marking methods.
Bacterial superantigens are a diverse family of toxins that induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. We show here that superantigens must bind directly into the dimer interface of CD28, a homodimer expressed on T cells, to elicit inflammatory cytokine gene expression and toxicity. CD28 functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through an interaction with its B7 coligands. However, superantigens use a conserved β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain of hitherto unknown function to engage CD28. Mutation of this superantigen domain abolished inflammatory cytokine gene induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed that when a superantigen binds to the T cell receptor on the T cell and major histocompatibility class II molecule on the antigen-presenting cell, CD28 can be accommodated readily as third superantigen receptor in the quaternary complex, with the CD28 dimer interface oriented towards the β-strand/hinge/α-helix domain in the superantigen. Our findings identify the CD28 homodimer interface as a critical receptor target for superantigens.
Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in mouse embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) triggers an anti-proliferative effect through the transcriptional activation of the Ink4/Arf tumor suppressor locus. The Wnt-effector Tcf1, but not Tcf3, is recruited to the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, and p19Arf, which mediate the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in mESCs. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in the downregulation of some cell differentiation genes, while the expression of pluripotency genes remains unperturbed. The cell cycle effects are dependent on β-catenin and the downstream transcription factor Tcf1 but independent of Tcf3, indicating specialized and non-overlapping functions of Tcf/Lef factors in mESCs. Furthermore, activation of the Wnt pathway induces an increased expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle such as the tumour suppressors Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a, p19Arf ) and Cdkn2b ( p15Ink4b ). In contrast to its mitogenic effect in somatic cells, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway triggers an anti-proliferative effect in mESCs via Tcf1 activity.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic to severe and even fatal. In this study, we investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) in DENV infection. pDCs are innate immune cells that produce interferon-α ( IFN-α ) and express membrane TRAIL ( mTRAIL ) in response to virus exposure. We characterized pDC activation in dengue patients and their function under DENV-2 stimulation in vitro. We found that pDCs from mild dengue patients exhibited significantly higher frequencies of mTRAIL compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IFN-α and soluble TRAIL were also increased in mild compared to severe dengue patients, positively correlating with pDC activation. In vitro exposure to DENV-2 induced mTRAIL expression on pDCs and relocalized TRAIL from the intracellular compartment to the plasma membrane. Chloroquine treatment inhibited DENV-2-induced mTRAIL relocalization and IFN-α production by pDCs. We also found that pDCs exerted an antiviral activity in infected human primary monocytes and that this activity was mainly dependent on IFN-α production. Our results suggest that TRAIL-expressing pDCs may have an important role in the outcome of dengue disease.
The role of tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) in host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection is complex. TNF plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. However, TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis ( TB ) in accordance with animal studies. To investigate the role of TNF in protection against the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection, we extend our previous mathematical models to investigate the roles and production of soluble ( sTNF ) and transmembrane TNF ( tmTNF ). We analyze effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual clinical trials ( VCTs ) by simulating two of the most commonly used therapies, anti-TNF antibody and TNF receptor fusion, and predict mechanisms that explain observed differences in TB reactivation rates. We find that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for causing reactivation of latent infection and that sTNF, even at very low levels, is essential for control of infection. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish mechanisms of action of the anti-TNF treatments and gain insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology. Our study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed that could balance the requirement for reduction of inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases.
In this study, we investigated inter-population differences in retrogene loss and expression in humans. We used data from the 1000 Genomes Project to examine the variation in loss of ancestral retrocopies among different human populations. We also analyzed retrocopy expression levels using RNA-Seq data from the Ilumina BodyMap project and lymphoblastoid cell lines from the Geuvadis Consortium. We developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome and experimentally confirmed the existence of 193 retroduplication variations ( RDVs ). The majority of these RDVs resulted from retrocopy deletion, and most had not been previously reported. We also experimentally confirmed the expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes that underwent deletion in certain individuals. The frequency of their deletion is very low, and the expression, conservation, and low rate of deletion of the remaining 10 retrocopies may suggest some functionality. In addition, we searched for differences in retrocopy expression levels between populations and found 9 retrogenes that undergo statistically significant differential expression.
Inflammation caused by praziquantel treatment of neurocysticercosis ( NCC ) depends on the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain. NCC is a pleomorphic disease caused by infection of the central nervous system by T. solium cysticerci. Inflammation around the cysticerci is the major cause of disease, but its presence is variable. We analyzed the inflammatory responses to cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma, meninges, or partially in contact with both ( corticomeningeal ). Histological specimens of brain cysticerci from 11 pigs naturally infected with T. solium cysticerci were used. We found that cysticerci located in the brain parenchyma provoked a significantly greater level of pericystic inflammation after praziquantel treatment compared to those located in the meninges or corticomeningeal tissue. The inflammatory response to cysticerci located in the meninges was significantly decreased compared to those in the parenchyma. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment only in parenchymal tissue. The suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs may be the reason subarachnoid NCC is generally refractory to treatment compared to parenchymal NCC.
Yaws, a re-emerging endemic treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, is reportedly endemic in Ghana. We conducted a cross-sectional survey in thirty communities in two districts of Ghana where mass drug administration ( MDA ) for trachoma had previously been conducted. Children aged 5–17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled, and samples were collected for treponemal serology, lesion PCR, and syphilis serology. We found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in these communities. All children had negative treponemal and non-treponemal serology, indicating that they had never been infected with yaws. PCR for T. pallidum ssp. pertenue was negative in all children, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. This suggests that H. ducreyi may be associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority of lesions remain unexplained. These findings have implications for the WHO yaws eradication campaign and highlight the need for integration of diagnostic testing into both pre and post-MDA surveillance systems to better inform yaws control programmes.
HIV persistence in the body remains a major challenge in the treatment of HIV infection, despite the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy ( ART ). The HIV reservoir, primarily composed of memory CD4 T cells, is a major obstacle to HIV eradication. The Jak-STAT pathway is a key regulator of T cell homeostasis, and dysregulation of this pathway is associated with HIV persistence. We evaluated the ability of two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, to block the seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir in vitro. Our results show that Jak inhibitors reduce the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA, block viral production from infected cells, and inhibit viral reactivation from latent stores. We also show that Jak inhibitors target key events downstream of γ-C cytokine ( IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15 ) ligation to their receptors, impacting the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in all memory CD4 T cell subsets in vitro and ex vivo. Importantly, we demonstrate that Jak inhibitors impede T cell activation and proliferation without impeding effector CD4 and CD8 HIV specific responses. Our results provide direct evidence for the involvement of the Jak-STAT pathway in HIV persistence in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro, and suggest that Jak inhibitors may represent a therapeutic modality to prevent key events of T cell activation that regulate HIV persistence.
Baculovirus infection of Spodoptera exigua larvae leads to an unexpected increase in gut microbiota. In contrast to the expected host transcriptional shut-off, S. exigua cells show a balanced number of up- and down-regulated genes during the first 36 hours following infection with either the species-specific baculovirus SeMNPV or the generalist baculovirus AcMNPV. Many immune-related genes are down-regulated after infection, including those involved in pattern recognition, immune pathways, immune effectors, and the melanization cascade. This down-regulation of immune-related genes is also observed in the larval gut. We hypothesize that the increase in gut bacterial load is a consequence of viral infection. Subsequent experiments reveal that gut bacteria enhance baculovirus virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion. The down-regulation of immune-related genes and the increase in gut microbiota suggest that baculoviruses may manipulate host immune responses for their own benefit. Recent studies have shown that baculoviruses encode microRNAs that target both viral and host genes. The present study extends previous works on the differential expression of host genes after infection with baculoviruses in other lepidopteran species.
Apomixis, a form of asexual clonal reproduction through seeds, is of great interest for its potential application in agriculture. One key element of apomixis is apomeiosis, a deregulation of meiosis that results in a mitotic-like division. Here, we report the isolation and characterisation of a novel gene that controls entry into the second meiotic division. By combining a mutation in this gene with two others that affect key meiotic processes, we created a genotype called MiMe in which meiosis is totally replaced by mitosis. This results in the production of functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to the mother plant. The creation of the MiMe genotype and apomeiosis phenotype is an important step towards understanding and engineering apomixis. In the MiMe genotype, meiosis is completely replaced by a mitotic-like division, resulting in the production of genetically identical gametes that retain the mother plant's heterozygosity for every genetic marker tested. This is in contrast to a previous case of apomeiosis reported in the Arabidopsis dyad mutant, in which only 0. 2% of dyad ovules generate viable gametes. MiMe plants, on the other hand, produce quasi–wild type levels of viable—and apomeiotic—ovules and pollen grains.
The prioritization of disease-causing genes is a fundamental challenge in the post-genomic era. Current methods exploit a protein-protein interaction ( PPI ) network for this task. However, these methods use a static picture of human PPIs, while diseases impact specific tissues in which the PPI networks may be dramatically different. Here, we perform a large-scale assessment of the contribution of tissue-specific information to gene prioritization by integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with PPI information. We construct tissue-specific PPI networks for 60 tissues and investigate their prioritization power. We find that tissue-specific PPI networks considerably improve the prioritization results compared to those obtained using a generic PPI network. Furthermore, they allow predicting novel disease-tissue associations, pointing to sub-clinical tissue effects that may escape early detection.
Insecticide resistance is a major concern in the control of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. To inform and optimise public health insecticide deployment strategies, we developed a flexible two-locus model for the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations. The model allows for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide, as well as varying selection pressures and dominance values depending on the concentration of insecticide encountered. We applied the model to investigate the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus their deployment as a mixture to minimise the spread of resistance. We recovered previously published results as subsets of this model and conducted a sensitivity analysis over an extensive parameter space to identify what circumstances favour mixtures over sequences. Our results indicate that mixtures are favoured when insecticide effectiveness is high and exposure is low, while sequential deployment may be more robust if insecticides do not reliably kill homozygous susceptible mosquitoes. We also found that resistance to an insecticide always spreads slower if that insecticide is used in a mixture, although this may be insufficient to outperform sequential use.
The sialome of Rhodnius neglectus, a vector of Chagas disease, was investigated using next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification. A total of 4, 230 coding DNA sequences ( CDS ) were deposited in GenBank, and 636 CDS of proteins of putative secretory nature were extracted from the assembled reads. Of these, 73 were confirmed by proteomic analysis. The sialome of R. neglectus was characterized, revealing the presence of ubiquitous protein families such as lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5, as well as less abundant metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding protein families. Notably, serine protease transcripts were detected in the sialome of R. neglectus. The secreted class of proteins was organized into subclasses that include previously known gene families present in hematophagous saliva, such as lipocalin, nitrophorin, and antigen-5, as well as gene families not commonly reported in triatomine saliva, such as serine protease and disintegrin.
Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode worm, is used as a model organism to study the interaction between nematodes and soil bacteria in grassland ecosystems. Using transcriptional profiling, we identified genes that are differentially expressed in response to different bacteria isolated from grassland nematodes or soils. Many of the regulated genes are predicted to affect metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting that similar genes could influence nematode community dynamics in natural systems. We used mutations to inactivate 21 of the identified genes and showed that most contribute to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment. Moreover, we demonstrated that changes in food source, as can occur in environmental disturbance, can have a large effect on gene expression, with important consequences for fitness. We used regression analysis to show that for many genes, the degree of differential gene expression between two bacterial environments predicted the magnitude of the effect of the loss of gene function on life history traits in those environments.
Mammalian embryo development involves the formation of an inner cell mass (ICM) surrounded by a trophoectoderm (TE), a shell of cells that later form extraembryonic structures. We investigated the design principles responsible for the robust establishment of these structures using multi-scale, stochastic modeling. Our results suggest that stochasticity in the expression of critical genes promotes cell plasticity and has a critical role in accurately organizing the developing mouse blastocyst. We found that asymmetry in the levels of noise variation ( expression fluctuation ) of Cdx2 and Oct4 provides a means to gain the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while ameliorating the potentially detrimental effects of stochasticity. By controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, the embryo temporally modulates plasticity and creates a time window during which each cell can continually read its environment and adjusts its fate. Our results suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst.
Antibodies encoded by germline gene segments are capable of binding to a wide range of antigens, a phenomenon known as polyspecificity. In this study, we investigated the basis for this polyspecificity by computationally redesigning antibodies encoded by three VH gene segments that bind to different antigens. We used the Rosetta multi-state design process to predict antibody sequences that could bind to multiple antigens simultaneously. The predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing the residues that enable polyspecificity. In contrast, when designing antibodies to bind to a single antigen, the predicted sequences were similar to those of mature antibodies. We demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition. Our results suggest that the hypervariable region CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework are critical contributors to polyspecificity in germline antibodies. We found that designing antibodies for polyspecificity recovered germline gene-encoded sequences, while designing antibodies for monospecificity to a single target returned sequences similar to the mature antibody. This trend increased in strength with the number of somatic mutations that had accumulated, i. e., the further optimized the antibody had become.
Locusts exhibit two interconvertible behavioral phases: solitarious and gregarious. Solitarious locusts are repelled by other locusts, while gregarious locusts are attracted to conspecifics and can form large aggregations such as marching hopper bands. We construct a partial integrodifferential equation model that incorporates the interplay between phase change and spatial movement at the individual level in order to predict the dynamics of hopper band formation at the population level. Stability analysis of our model reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large scale transition to the gregarious phase. A model reduction enables quantification of the temporal dynamics of each phase, of the proportion of the population that will eventually gregarize, and of the time scale for this to occur. Numerical simulations provide descriptions of the aggregation's structure and reveal transiently traveling clumps of gregarious insects. Our predictions of aggregation and mass gregarization suggest several possible future biological experiments.
Enveloped viruses, such as flaviviruses, initiate membrane fusion through a series of triggered conformational changes of their envelope glycoproteins, or fusion proteins. Although high-resolution structures of viral fusion proteins in their prefusion and postfusion conformations are available, it has been difficult to define intermediate structures of the fusion pathway because of their transient nature. Here, we show that exposure of tick-borne encephalitis virus to alkaline pH instead of acidic pH traps the particles in an intermediate conformation in which the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without proceeding to the merger of the membranes. Further treatment to low pH leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers correspond to an as-yet-elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. Thus, the use of nonphysiological conditions allows a dissection of the flavivirus fusion process and the identification of two separate steps, in which membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers precedes the formation of hairpin-like trimers. This sequence of events provides important new insights for understanding the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion.
Extinction risk and diversification are linked in the Cape of South Africa, a global plant biodiversity hotspot. Here, we demonstrate that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between the Cape and the UK floras, inconsistent with a simple, trait-based model of extinction. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape flora, we reveal a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinction risks. However, the most threatened species cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. From analyzing the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades, we suggest that mode of speciation best explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. Our results demonstrate that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, we find that the most vulnerable plant species are marching towards extinction at a more rapid pace independently from anthropogenic effects.
Phagocytosis of the fungal pathogen Candida albicans by cells of the innate immune system is crucial for preventing infection. Dectin-1 is the major phagocytic receptor involved in anti-fungal immunity. We identify two new interacting proteins of Dectin-1 in macrophages, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase ( BTK ) and Vav1. BTK and Vav1 are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae but are absent from mature phagosomes. BTK and Vav1 localize to cuff regions surrounding the hyphae, while Dectin-1 lines the full length of the phagosome. BTK and Vav1 colocalize with the lipid PI ( 3, 4, 5 ) P3 and F-actin at the phagocytic cup, but not with diacylglycerol ( DAG ) which marks more mature phagosomal membranes. Using a selective BTK inhibitor, we show that BTK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phagocytic cup and the subsequent recruitment of PKCε. BTK- or Vav1-deficient peritoneal macrophages display a defect in both zymosan and C. albicans phagocytosis. Bone marrow-derived macrophages that lack BTK or Vav1 show reduced uptake of C. albicans, comparable to Dectin1-deficient cells. BTK- or Vav1-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C. albicans infection than wild type mice.
Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans. Madagascar was heavily affected by RVF in 2008–2009, with evidence of a large and heterogeneous spread of the disease. Our study aimed to identify the environmental factors and areas favorable to RVF transmission to both cattle and humans, as well as human behaviors favoring human infections in Malagasy contexts. We characterized the environments of Malagasy communes using Multiple Factor Analysis ( MFA ) and analyzed cattle and human serological data collected at the national level using Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Our results showed that cattle and human seroprevalence rates were positively associated with humid environments ( p<0. 001 ) and that areas with high cattle density were at risk ( p<0. 01; OR = 2. 6 ). We also found that frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection ( OR = 1. 6 ). Our study highlighted the eastern-coast, western, and north-western parts of Madagascar as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle. The association between cattle seroprevalence, humid environments, and high cattle density suggests that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintain RVF enzootic transmission.
Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that can be transmitted between non-identical proteins. However, transmission of the prion state between homologous proteins from different species is frequently inefficient. Here, we use a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based experimental system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. We show that Rnq1 encompasses multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. Subsequent analysis of [PIN+] transmission between Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants established that ( i ) one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for the transmission; ( ii ) despite identical sequences of the common QNs, such transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. This indicates that in complex prion domains multiple prion determinants act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, and reveals transmission barriers determined by this cooperative fold.
Deep learning is introduced as a novel likelihood-free inference framework for population genetic analysis. This approach circumvents the problem of computing the likelihood of complex population genetic models given genomic variation data from multiple individuals. We demonstrate that deep learning can be effectively employed for population genetic inference and learning informative features of data. As a concrete application, we focus on jointly inferring natural selection and demography ( in the form of a population size change history ). Our method is able to separate the global nature of demography from the local nature of selection, without sequential steps for these two factors. We apply our method to 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer both their overall demography, and regions of their genome under selection. We find many regions of the genome that have experienced hard sweeps, and fewer under selection on standing variation ( soft sweep ) or balancing selection. Interestingly, we find that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. In addition, our demographic inference suggests that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme.
High-risk human papillomavirus ( HPV ) oncogenes, such as E6 and E7, contribute to the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers by disrupting the Fanconi anemia ( FA ) DNA repair pathway. We show that E6/E7 expressing cells are hypersensitive to cisplatin, a DNA crosslinking agent, and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks ( ICLs ). HPV oncogenes activate the FA pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation. However, they inhibit the completion of the repair by multiple mechanisms. E6/E7 impair FancD2 colocalization with double-strand breaks ( DSBs ), which hinders the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSBs in E6 expressing cells. Furthermore, E6 expression causes delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, an important process for effective ICL repair. Delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination is associated with increased chromatin retention of FancD2, hindering USP1 de-ubiquitinating activity, and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling. E6 mediated p53 degradation does not hamper the cell cycle specific process of FancD2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting FancD2 de-ubiquitination. Additionally, E6 reduces the expression and foci formation of Palb2, a repair protein downstream of FancD2.
Onchocerciasis, caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus, is a major public health problem in the Southern Chiapas focus of Mexico. Since 1998, all 559 endemic communities in this focus have undergone semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin. In 2003, the treatment frequency was increased to four times a year in 50 communities, and in 2009, an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly treatment regimen. The goal of the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas is to eliminate new ocular morbidity caused by infection with O. volvulus and eventually eliminate transmission of the parasite in all 13 foci in Latin America. The Southern Chiapas focus represents one of the major onchocerciasis foci in Latin America, accounting for about 21% of the total at-risk population in the Americas. Since the 1990s, onchocerciasis control in Mexico has relied on the mass distribution of ivermectin to the at-risk communities. A total of 22 consecutive treatment rounds reaching >85% of the eligible population have been provided in the Southern Chiapas focus over the past 11 years. Ivermectin coverage of the eligible population has remained at a level greater than 85% every year from 1998 through 2011. In-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessments were performed in six sentinel communities ( which had undergone 2 rounds of ivermectin treatment per year ) and three extra-sentinel communities ( which had undergone 4 rounds of ivermectin treatment per year ). None of the 67, 924 Simulium ochraceum s. l. collected from this focus during the dry season of 2011 were found to contain parasite DNA when tested by polymerase chain reaction-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( PCR-ELISA ), resulting in an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval ( 95%-ULCI ) of the infective rate in the vectors of 0. 06/2, 000 flies examined. Serological assays testing for Onchocerca volvulus exposure conducted on 4, 230 children 5 years of age and under ( of a total population of 10, 280 in this age group ) revealed that 2/4, 230 individuals were exposed to O. volvulus ( 0. 05%; one sided 95% confidence interval = 0. 08% ). The in-depth epidemiological and entomological findings from the Southern Chiapas focus meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community.
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cell cytosol. A transcriptional activator known as PrfA regulates gene products required for intracellular bacterial growth and bacterial spread to adjacent cells. However, the signal that stimulates PrfA activation has not yet been defined. Here, we provide evidence for L. monocytogenes secretion of a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, which enhances the escape of L. monocytogenes from host cell vacuoles and may facilitate PrfA activation. The pPplA pheromone is generated via the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. While the PplA lipoprotein is dispensable for pathogenesis, bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of nonprofessional phagocytic cells. Mutational activation of PrfA restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling. Experimental evidence suggests that the pPplA peptide may help signal to L. monocytogenes its presence within the confines of the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol.
Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, is a highly adaptable pathogen that is able to colonize host small intestines and combat host-produced reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) during infection. In this study, we performed a whole-genome transposon sequencing analysis ( Tn-seq ) to dissect the molecular mechanisms utilized by V. cholerae to overcome ROS in vivo. We compared gene requirements for colonization using adult mice with and without the treatment of the antioxidant, N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ). We found that mutants of the methyl-directed mismatch repair ( MMR ) system, such as MutS, displayed significant colonization advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice, but not in NAC-treated mice. Further analyses suggest that the accumulation of both catalase-overproducing mutants and rugose colony variants in NAC-treated mice was the leading cause of mutS mutant enrichment caused by oxidative stress during infection. We also found that rugose variants could revert back to smooth colonies upon aerobic, in vitro culture. Moreover, the mutation rate of wildtype colonized in NAC-treated mice was significantly higher than that in NAC+ mice. These findings support a paradigm in which V. cholerae employs a temporal adaptive strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes.
Mlh1-Mlh3 is a heterodimeric endonuclease involved in both meiotic crossing over and DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) in baker’s yeast. To understand how Mlh1-Mlh3 functions in both meiosis and MMR, we analyzed 60 new mlh3 alleles. Five alleles specifically disrupted MMR, whereas one ( mlh3-32 ) specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. We purified and characterized Mlh1-mlh3-32 ( MMR+, crossover- ) and Mlh1-mlh3-45 ( MMR-, crossover+ ) and found that both displayed wild-type endonuclease activities in vitro. Msh2-Msh3 stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh1-mlh3-32 but not Mlh1-mlh3-45, suggesting that Mlh1-mlh3-45 is defective in MSH interactions. Whole genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type and MMR+ crossover-, MMR- crossover+, endonuclease defective and null mlh3 mutants in an S288c/YJM789 hybrid background. All of the mlh3 mutants showed increases in the number of noncrossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative recombination pathways. Our observations provide a structure-function map for Mlh3 that reveals the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3’s enzymatic activity.
Host population structure plays an important role in the reversion dynamics of pathogen populations after the discontinuation of antibiotic treatment. We show that heterogeneity in the number of contacts among hosts leads to a non-random distribution of the resistant strain among the infected population during treatment, and affects the competition dynamics between sensitive and resistant strains after treatment is stopped. As a result, we observe a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability of reversion to sensitivity on the population level after treatment is stopped. Our simulations confirm that contact heterogeneity lowers the probability of reversion back to sensitivity, even when a substantial fraction of the pathogen population is sensitive at the time point when treatment is stopped. The impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small. In this range, large fitness differences between sensitive and resistant strains result in a non-trivial distribution of sensitive and resistant infections over the network, which in turn influences the reversion dynamics once treatment is stopped.
Autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ) are highly heritable and characterised by deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviours. Although a number of highly penetrant ASD gene variants have been identified, there is growing evidence to support a causal role for combinatorial effects arising from the contributions of multiple loci. By examining synaptic and circadian neurological phenotypes resulting from the dosage variants of unique human:fly orthologues in Drosophila, we observe numerous synergistic interactions between pairs of informatically-identified candidate genes whose orthologues are jointly affected by large de novo copy number variants ( CNVs ). These CNVs were found in the genomes of individuals with autism, including a patient carrying a 22q11. 2 deletion. We first demonstrate that dosage alterations of the unique Drosophila orthologues of candidate genes from de novo CNVs that harbour only a single candidate gene display neurological defects similar to those previously reported in Drosophila models of ASD-associated variants. We then considered pairwise dosage changes within the set of orthologues of candidate genes that were affected by the same single human de novo CNV. For three of four CNVs with complete orthologous relationships, we observed significant synergistic effects following the simultaneous dosage change of gene pairs drawn from a single CNV. The phenotypic variation observed at the Drosophila synapse that results from these interacting genetic variants supports a concordant phenotypic outcome across all interacting gene pairs following the direction of human gene copy number change.
Cerebral malaria ( ECM ) is a severe complication of Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection of C57BL/6 mice. CD8+ T cells are known to play a central role in the development of ECM, but the mechanisms through which they mediate their pathogenic activity remain poorly understood. We show that CD8+ T cells accumulate within the perivascular spaces of the brains of mice infected with both ECM-inducing ( P. berghei ANKA ) and non-inducing ( P. berghei NK65 ) parasites. However, perivascular T cells displayed an arrested behavior specifically during P. berghei ANKA infection, characterized by long-term cognate interactions with CX3CR1-bearing antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) within the brains. These interactions did not prevent ECM development when abrogated by targeted depletion of the APCs. Pathogenic CD8+ T cells were found to colocalize with rare apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within the brain during ECM. However, cellular apoptosis was a rare event and did not result in loss of cerebral vasculature or correspond with the extensive disruption to its integrity observed during ECM. Our data show that the arrest of T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique signature of ECM-inducing malaria infection and implies an important role for this event in the development of the ECM-syndrome.
Tungiasis, also known as jigger infestation, is a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans. The disease is endemic in tropical and subtropical countries and affects communities living in precarious conditions. In Vihiga County, Kenya, the overall prevalence of tungiasis was found to be 21. 5% ( 95% CI: 17. 7–25. 3% ) based on a cross-sectional study of 437 participants aged 5 years and above. The study was conducted in 21 villages in 3 sub-locations and used a semi-structured questionnaire to assess socio-demographic factors, housing, presence and ownership of animals, knowledge and practice related to tungiasis. Multivariate analysis suggested that the occurrence of tungiasis was associated with variables indicating low economic status, such as a monthly income of Ksh ≤ 1000 ( adjusted odds ratio 27. 85; 95% CI: 4. 13–187. 59 ), earthen floor ( 0. 36; 0. 13–1. 024 ) and lack of toilet facilities ( 4. 27; 0. 82–22. 34 ). Other factors associated with tungiasis included age of participant ≤14 ( 27. 414; 10. 02–74. 99 ), no regular use of closed footwear ( 1. 98; 0. 987–3. 97 ) and common resting place inside the house ( 1. 93; 0. 96–3. 89 ).
A computational model of auxin transport in the Arabidopsis root tip has been developed to understand the dynamics of the regulatory network between auxin and cytokinins. The model shows that an auxin maximum is positioned along the xylem axis of the root tip due to mutual feedback between auxin and cytokinins mediated by the PIN class of auxin efflux transporters and AHP6, an inhibitor of cytokinin signalling. Our analysis reveals that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels is theoretically unlikely and not required for correct and robust auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response allow for the necessary feedbacks, which can amplify and stabilise the auxin maximum. The model also shows that polar localisation of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that stabilises the accumulation of auxin within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in the xylem-pole pericycle cells, an important early step in lateral root initiation. Furthermore, the model reveals that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other. The model also predicts and experimentally verifies a role of AUX1 and LAX1/2 auxin influx transporters in vascular patterning.
NPF/NO signaling pathway plays a regulatory role in phase-related locomotor plasticity in the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. We report that the transcription factor CREB-B is a key mediator in the signaling pathway from NPF2 to NOS in the migratory locust, triggering locomotor activity shift between solitarious and gregarious phases. CREB-B directly activates brain NOS expression by interacting with the NOS promoter region. The phosphorylation at serine 110 site of CREB-B dynamically changes in response to population density variation and is negatively controlled by NPF2. The involvement of CREB-B in NPF2-regulated locomotor plasticity is further validated by RNAi experiment and behavioral assay. Furthermore, we reveal that protein kinase A ( PKA ) mediates the regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription. These findings highlight a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
Maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs drive the earliest stages of development in most metazoans. In Drosophila, the maternal-to-zygotic transition ( MZT ) is preceded by the transcription of a small number of genes that initiate sex determination, patterning, and other early developmental processes. The zinc-finger protein Zelda ( ZLD ) plays a key role in their transcriptional activation. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing ( ChIP-Seq ) to map regions bound by ZLD before, during, and after the MZT. We identified thousands of regions bound by ZLD in cycle 8 embryos, most of which remain bound through mitotic cycle 14. Early ZLD-bound regions include the promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this early stage. However, we also observed ZLD bound at cycle 8 to the promoters of roughly a thousand genes whose first transcription does not occur until the MZT and to virtually all of the thousands of known and presumed enhancers bound at cycle 14 by transcription factors that regulate patterned gene activation during the MZT. The association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is so strong that ZLD binding alone can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This suggests that ZLD is not only required for the earliest wave of transcription but also plays a major role in activating the genome at the MZT.
Circadian protein–protein interactions ( PPIs ) play a crucial role in the temporal organization of cellular functions. Here, we identified 109 novel PPIs among circadian clock proteins using a yeast-two-hybrid approach. Among them, the interaction of protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1 was found to result in BMAL1 destabilization. We constructed a dynamic circadian PPI network predicting the PPI timing using circadian expression data. Systematic circadian phenotyping ( RNAi and overexpression ) suggests a crucial role for components involved in dynamic interactions. We found that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times likely to restrict regulatory interactions to specific phases. Moreover, we predict that circadian PPIs dynamically connect many important cellular processes ( signal transduction, cell cycle, etc. ) contributing to temporal organization of cellular physiology.
Nematode polyprotein allergens ( NPAs ) are an unusual class of lipid-binding proteins found only in nematodes. They are synthesized as large, tandemly repetitive polyproteins that are post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of small lipid-binding proteins. The most common repeating unit of the NPA of Ascaris suum is ABA-1A, which is closely similar to that of Ascaris lumbricoides, the large intestinal roundworm of humans. Immune responses to NPAs have been associated with naturally-acquired resistance to infection in humans, and the immune repertoire to them is under strict genetic control. The solution structure of ABA-1A was determined by protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It adopts a novel seven-helical fold comprising a long central helix that participates in two hollow four-helical bundles on either side. Discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets are found in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, and the amino acid sidechains affected by ligand ( fatty acid ) binding were identified. Recombinant ABA-1A contains tightly-bound ligand ( s ) of bacterial culture origin in one of its binding sites. This is the first mature, post-translationally processed, unit of a naturally-occurring tandemly-repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized from any source, and it belongs to a new structural class.
Ciguatera fish poisoning is a significant public health problem in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs). Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39, 677 reported cases of ciguatera, with a mean annual incidence of 194 cases per 100, 000 people across the region. This represents a 60% increase in the annual incidence of ciguatera compared to the reported annual incidence of 104/100, 000 between 1973 and 1983. Taking into account under-reporting, an estimated 500, 000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from ciguatera over the last 35 years. Ciguatera is caused by the consumption of coral reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxin, a toxin produced by dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. The toxin bioaccumulates up the food web and can cause severe acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, as well as chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months. Ciguatera is often under-diagnosed and under-reported, with only 2 to 10% of cases reported to health authorities. The incidence of ciguatera is expected to continue to increase in the future due to changes in global climate patterns, degradation of coastal marine environments, and increased exploitation of coastal marine resources.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is characterized by the persistence of the parasite and impairment of the cellular immune response. CD4+CD8+ T cells have been reported to expand in chronic Chagas disease patients, but little is known about the impact of antiparasitic treatment on this population. In this study, we investigated the effect of benznidazole treatment on the functional response of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells in chronic Chagas disease patients. We found that the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells was higher in chronic Chagas disease patients than in healthy donors, with a higher ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations. We also observed higher expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors in CD4+CD8+ T cells from chronic Chagas disease patients compared to healthy donors. Benznidazole treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+CD8+ T cells, decreased the ratio of CD4+CD8low/CD4+CD8high subpopulations, and reduced the co-expression level of inhibitory receptors. Importantly, treatment also enhanced the multifunctional capacity of CD4+CD8+ T cells and increased the frequency of T. cruzi antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells expressing IL-2 and TNF-α. These findings suggest that CD4+CD8+ T cells play an important role in the control of T. cruzi infection and that benznidazole treatment improves the quality of antigen-specific CD4+CD8+ T cell responses and partially reverses the exhaustion process of these cells.
Phospholipase C2 ( AtPLC2 ) is the primary phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase in Arabidopsis thaliana and plays a crucial role in phosphoinositide metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress response. Lipidomic profiling of multiple plc mutants showed that the plc2-1 mutant had increased levels of its substrates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate, suggesting that the major phosphoinositide metabolic pathway is impaired. AtPLC2 displayed a distinct tissue expression pattern and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types, where phosphoinositide signaling occurs. The seedlings of plc2-1 mutant showed growth defects that were complemented by heterologous expression of AtPLC2, suggesting that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity borne by AtPLC2 is required for seedling growth. Moreover, the plc2-1 mutant showed hypersensitive response to ER stress as evidenced by changes in relevant phenotypes and gene expression profiles. Our results revealed the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism, its involvement in seedling growth and an emerging link between phosphoinositide and the ER stress response.
Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information ( Φ ), and show that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. We evaluate cause-effect power across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible black boxes. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. We show that black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms ( higher composition ) that are more interconnected ( higher integration ). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) are produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain ( RC ) as a result of the interaction between molecular oxygen and free radicals, such as semiquinone ( Q− ). ROS are important signals that modulate cellular adaptation to the environment, but can also damage cells under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation relevant for various systemic diseases or transplantation. To investigate the mechanism and determinants of ROS production, we extended a rule-based model of complex III to account for electron transport in the whole RC coupled to proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential generation, TCA cycle reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. The model fits respiratory electron fluxes measured in rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, and the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I. Our analysis revealed an association of ROS production with levels of specific radicals of individual electron transporters and their combinations in species of complexes I and III. We found that the phenomenon of bistability, previously revealed as a property of complex III, remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted based on theoretical analysis and confirmed experimentally.
Motor proteins are essential for intracellular transport in eucaryotic cells, converting chemical energy into kinetic energy to transport cargo over long distances. Motor proteins work in teams to enable unidirectional and bidirectional transport. Disruptions in the underlying transport mechanisms can cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington’s, Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s. For example, phosphorylation of the kinesin motor domain at the serine residue is implicated in Huntington’s disease. In this article, we report the effects of mutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. Our results indicate that mutants with altered stall forces can determine the average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered by wild-type motors in the ensemble. We also show that mutants gain a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in the expected run-length when the load on the cargo is in the vicinity of the mutant’s stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force. We developed a semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types. This method determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo and enables a computation of biologically relevant quantities such as average velocity and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. Our method can also be used to introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to model a mutation and to deduce effects of such alterations on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors.
The CACNA1C gene, which codes for the α subunit of the Cav1. 2 L-type high-voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, has been associated with severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders. We investigated how a selective knockout of the Cacna1c gene would modulate the learning process on an operant cue discrimination task in mice. We found that Cacna1c knockout mice still managed to increase reward feedback across trials, but did so by adapting an outcome-based strategy. In contrast, the majority of matched controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association rule. Our results suggest that the CACNA1C gene has a specific role in learning and that much more mechanistic insight could be gained by examining response patterns in terms of a larger repertoire of potential behavioral strategies. We used a detailed, individual-level analysis of learning on the operant cue discrimination task, combined with Bayesian selection among computational models estimated from the empirical data. Our results may also have clinical implications for treating psychiatric disorders associated with the CACNA1C gene.
Wolbachia-infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are being released to control arbovirus transmission. However, their ability to invade populations and persist depends on their interaction with environmental conditions, particularly temperature. We investigated the effects of cyclical heat stress on Wolbachia infections in Ae. aegypti. We reared larvae infected with wMel, wAlbB and wMelPop-CLA under diurnal cyclical temperatures of 26–37°C. We found that wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections exhibited reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation induced by Wolbachia, and a sharp reduction in Wolbachia density in adults. Furthermore, wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections were not transmitted to the next generation when mosquitoes were exposed to 26–37°C across all life stages. In contrast, wAlbB infection was maintained at a high density, exhibited complete cytoplasmic incompatibility and was transmitted from mother to offspring with high fidelity under this temperature cycle. These findings have implications for the potential success of Wolbachia interventions across different environments and highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing.
Adenoviruses are important human pathogens that have been developed as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines. We sought to understand the natural history of adenovirus infections in various non-human primates and discovered that healthy populations of great apes ( chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans ) and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in stool. Shedding in stools from asymptomatic humans was found to be much less frequent, comparable to frequencies reported before. We purified and fully sequenced 30 novel adenoviruses from apes and 3 novel adenoviruses from macaques. Analyses of the new ape adenovirus sequences together with 22 complete adenovirus genomes available from GenBank revealed that ape adenoviruses could be classified into species corresponding to human adenovirus species B, C, and E. There was evidence for intraspecies recombination between adenoviruses, and the high degree of phylogenetic relatedness of adenoviruses across their various primate hosts provided evidence for cross species transmission events to have occurred in the natural history of B and E viruses. The high degree of asymptomatic shedding of live adenovirus in non-human primates and evidence for zoonotic transmissions warrants caution for primate handling and housing. Furthermore, the presence of persistent and/or latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in the design and interpretation of human and non-human primate studies with adenovirus vectors.
Chromatin, the fundamental structural unit of the eukaryotic genome, is composed of a protein-DNA complex called the nucleosome, where 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1. 75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level are not yet well understood. We used molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. The free energy change of about 11. 5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping agrees well with values obtained in single molecule experiments. The simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating there are many potential paths to outer superhelical turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. The unwrapping process starts at one end of the DNA, where the first five base pairs unwrap, followed by a second five base pairs unwrapping at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then starts at the other end of the DNA, where 10 base pairs are unwrapped. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.
Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D ( ApoD ) is an extracellular lipid binding protein with antioxidant capacity that is secreted by astrocytes in the nervous system to help neurons cope with oxidative stress. We demonstrate that ApoD is endocytosed and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner, where it helps to maintain lysosomal pH gradients by preventing lysosomal membrane permeabilization. ApoD is functionally stable in the acidic lysosomal environment, and its presence is sufficient and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization in both astrocytes and neurons. We show that ApoD is a specific marker for the subpopulation of lysosomes vulnerable to oxidation, and that it helps to keep lipid peroxides levels under control. We also demonstrate that ApoD is required for lysosomal-dependent biological processes, such as myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and optimization of neurodegeneration-triggered autophagy in a Drosophila in vivo model. Our results uncover a previously unknown biological function of ApoD and set a lipoprotein-mediated regulation of lysosomal membrane integrity as a new mechanism at the hub of many cellular functions, critical for the outcome of a wide variety of neurodegenerative diseases.
Phlebotomus orientalis sand flies are the main vectors of visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) caused by Leishmania donovani in East Africa. Here, we report on the life cycle parameters and susceptibility to L. donovani of two P. orientalis colonies originating from different sites in Ethiopia: Melka Werer ( MW ), a non-endemic site in the lowlands, and Addis Zemen ( AZ ), an endemic focus of human VL in the highlands. We found marked differences in life-cycle parameters between the two colonies, including distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analyses using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA ( RAPD ) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI mitochondrial genes did not reveal any genetic differences between the two colonies. F1 hybrids developed successfully with higher fecundity than the parental colonies. Both MW and AZ colonies of P. orientalis were highly susceptible to experimental infections with L. donovani, even at the lowest infective dose tested ( 2×103 per ml ). Leishmania development in P. orientalis was fast, with the presence of metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and the colonization of the stomodeal valve by haptomonads recorded in most P. orientalis females by day five post-blood feeding.
Schistosomiasis japonica is a serious health and economic burden in the People's Republic of China, yet it has not been included in the Global Burden of Disease ( GBD ) study. A patient-based quality-of-life evaluation was performed for advanced schistosomiasis japonica in a schistosoma japonicum-hyperendemic county. Of 506 suspected or officially registered cases, 215 were confirmed and evaluated using the European quality of life questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension ( EQ-5D plus ), ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort ( 90. 7% ), usual activities ( 87. 9% ), and anxiety or depression ( 80. 9% ). The overall disability weight ( DW ) was 0. 447, and age-specific DWs ranged from 0. 378 among individuals aged 30–44 years to 0. 510 among the elderly aged ≥60 years. DWs were positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life. These patient-preference disability estimates could provide updated data for a revision of the GBD, as well as for evidence-based decision-making in P. R. China's national schistosomiasis control program.
Sleeping sickness, also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis ( HAT ), and nagana, also known as African Animal Trypanosomiasis ( AAT ), are highly prevalent parasitic vector-borne diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. These diseases are caused by the protozoa Trypanosoma brucei ( T. b. ) spp. and are transmitted to humans through the bite of a tsetse fly infected with the parasite. In Kenya, tsetse flies are capable vectors for T. b. rhodesiense and other trypanosoma agents that cause AAT. This study examined the use of national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's 7 tsetse belts, where tsetse species are capable vectors for T. b. rhodesiense and other trypanosoma agents that cause AAT. The study used a multilevel study design to estimate the likelihood of disability in individuals, nested within households, nested within tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty. Tsetse fly's impact on disability was conceptualised via two exposure pathways: directly from the bite of a pathogenic tsetse fly resulting in HAT infection or indirectly, as the potential for AAT takes land out of agricultural production and diseased livestock leads to livestock morbidity and mortality, contributing to nutritional deficiencies and poverty. The study identified tsetse belts that were significantly associated with increased disability prevalence and evaluated the direct and indirect exposure pathways.
In this study, we demonstrate that hexamethylene bisacetamide ( HMBA ) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells. We show that HMBA activates the PI3K/Akt pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation of HEXIM1 and the subsequent release of active positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb ) from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM1 and 7SK small nuclear RNA ( snRNA ). As a result, P-TEFb is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription elongation and viral production. Importantly, the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the expression of a mutant HEXIM1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA via the PI3K/Akt pathway antagonize this HMBA-mediated induction of viral production. Thus, our studies reveal how HIV transcription is induced by HMBA and suggest how modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb could contribute to cell differentiation.
Leishmaniasis is one of the most important human protozoan parasitic diseases worldwide, with a prevalence of 12 million infections and a further 350 million people living at risk across 98 countries. Patients suffering from cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) caused by New World Leishmania ( Viannia ) species are at high risk of developing mucosal ( ML ) or disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis ( DCL ). Recently, we connected this aggressive phenotype to the presence of Leishmania RNA virus ( LRV ) in strains of L. guyanensis, showing that LRV is responsible for elevated parasitaemia, destructive hyper-inflammation and an overall exacerbation of the disease. LRVs show significant evolutionary divergence, making detection and quantitation challenging. To address this, we report various techniques for LRV detection, including the use of an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody ( J2 ) that specifically and quantitatively recognizes dsRNA in a sequence-independent fashion. We evaluate each method and demonstrate successful LRV detection by the J2 antibody in several parasite strains, a freshly isolated patient sample and lesion biopsies of infected mice. We propose that refinements of these methods could be transferred to the field for use as a diagnostic tool in detecting the presence of LRV, and potentially assessing the LRV-related risk of complications in cutaneous leishmaniasis.
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli ( EHEC ) and enteropathogenic E. coli ( EPEC ) are closely related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. To trigger pedestal formation, EPEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHEC relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU. We characterized the colonization properties of EPEC and EHEC during infection of polarized epithelial cells and found that both pathogens formed distinct bacterial communities, or “macrocolonies, ” that encompassed multiple host cells. Tir and EspFU, as well as the host Arp2/3 complex, were all critical for the expansion of macrocolonies over time. We found that EspFU accelerated the formation of larger macrocolonies compared to EPEC Tir, as EspFU-mediated actin assembly drove faster bacterial motility to cell junctions, where bacteria formed a secondary pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one of the daughters to disengage and infect the second cell. Collectively, these data reveal that EspFU enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting an efficient method of cell-to-cell transmission.
Extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) from helminth pathogens, such as the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica ( F. hepatica ), need to be purified from their excretory-secretory products ( ESP ) for downstream studies and application development. The most commonly used purification method is differential centrifugation ( DC ), but size exclusion chromatography ( SEC ) has been used for EV purification from other pathogens. In this study, we compared DC and SEC methods for EV purification from F. hepatica culture media. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy showed that SEC purified EVs were smaller and less diverse than DC purified EVs. Protein quantification and Western blotting demonstrated that SEC purified EVs had a higher purity to free ESP yield ratio than DC purified EVs. Proteomic analysis showed that DC purified EVs contained more ESP and tegumental proteins than SEC purified EVs. These results suggest that DC and SEC purification methods do not isolate equivalent EV population profiles. We propose that SEC methods should be used for EV purification prior to downstream studies. This is because SEC purified EVs have a higher purity to free ESP yield ratio and a less diverse EV proteome compared to DC purified EVs.
Post-transcriptional regulation of gap genes in Drosophila melanogaster has been studied using a reverse-engineering approach. This method involves fitting a model to data to infer and analyse regulatory mechanisms. We use detailed, quantitative datasets of gap gene mRNA and protein expression to solve and fit a model of post-transcriptional regulation, and establish its structural and practical identifiability. Our results show that post-transcriptional regulation is not required for patterning in this system, but is necessary for proper control of protein levels. We demonstrate that the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation. This greatly increases the potential of reverse engineering for the study of development and other complex biological processes.
Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide and exhibits a pronounced tropism for small intestinal epithelial cells ( IECs ). Both human infants and neonatal mice are highly susceptible to rotavirus infection, whereas adult individuals remain asymptomatic and shed only low numbers of viral particles. Here, we investigated age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial innate immune response to rotavirus infection in an oral mouse infection model. We found that expression of the innate immune receptor Toll-like receptor 3 ( Tlr3 ) was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but strongly increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in Tlr3 or the adaptor molecule Trif ( TrifLps2/Lps2 ) exhibited significantly higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes as compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in Tlr3 or Trif did not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, we detected a major contribution of the non-hematopoietic cell compartment in the Trif-mediated antiviral host response in adult animals. Finally, a significant age-dependent increase of TLR3 expression was also detected in human small intestinal biopsies.
We report on the results of whole-exome sequencing ( WES ) of 1, 039 subjects with autism spectrum disorders ( ASD ) and 870 controls of similar ancestry from the NIMH repository. The WES data came from two centers using different methods to produce sequence and call variants. To ensure the distribution of rare variation was similar for data from different centers, we filtered called variants by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative to reference reads. Gene-based analyses of association were evaluated using seven samples sequenced at both centers and by results from the association study. We found that mega-analysis has better power than meta-analysis for gene-based tests. We also explored the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis in these data and found that principal component-based analyses were sufficient to control for ancestry and produce test statistics with appropriate distributions. After using a variety of gene-based tests and both meta- and mega-analysis, we found no new risk genes for ASD in this sample. Our results suggest that standard gene-based tests will require much larger samples of cases and controls before being effective for gene discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.
Madurella mycetomatis is the most prevalent causative agent of eumycetoma in Sudan, an infection characterized by the formation of grains. We investigated the association between polymorphisms in the genes encoding for the chitin-degrading enzymes chitotriosidase and AMCase and the incidence of M. mycetomatis mycetoma in a Sudanese population. Polymorphisms studied included a 24-bp insertion in the chitotriosidase gene ( rs3831317 ), a single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in the AMCase gene ( rs61756687 ), a SNP ( rs41282492 ), and a 10-bp insertion in the 5’UTR region of the AMCase gene ( rs143789088 ). DNA was isolated from blood and genotypes were determined using PCR-RFLP. Histological staining proved the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The polymorphism resulting in decreased chitotriosidase activity was associated with increased odds of eumycetoma ( odds ratio 2. 9; p = 0. 004 ). No association was found for the polymorphisms in the genes for AMCase ( all p>0. 05 ).
Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) has been used as a model to study viral latency, which is characterized by the persistence of viral DNA in the absence of infectious virus. Previous studies have shown that lytic genes can be transcribed during latency, but there has been no direct evidence that these transcripts are translated into proteins. We used a Cre-marking model to show that lytic and latent phases of HSV-1 infection are less clearly defined than previously thought. We found that around half of the HSV spread leading to latently infected sites occurred beyond the initial acute infection, and that lytic promoters can drive protein expression during latency. This is the most direct evidence to date showing that HSV-1 lytic promoters are capable of generating protein during latency establishment and maintenance. We also found that lytic promoters can drive protein expression during latency, which is consistent with either limited stochastic lytic gene expression being an integral part of latency or the early presentation of these proteins to CD8+ T cells providing an opportunity for reactivation to be halted at a very early stage by an immune mechanism.
Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases. In prion diseases, the host prion protein is misfolded to form a pathogenic protease-resistant form, PrPSc, which accumulates in neurons, astroglia, and microglia in the central nervous system ( CNS ). Using dual-staining immunohistochemistry, we compared the cell specificity of PrPSc accumulation at early preclinical times post-infection using three mouse scrapie strains that differ in brain regional pathology. We found that PrPSc from each strain had a different pattern of cell specificity. Strain 22L was mainly associated with astroglia, whereas strain ME7 was mainly associated with neurons and neuropil. Strain RML was similar to 22L in thalamus and cortex, but similar to ME7 in substantia nigra. Despite the cellular differences in PrPSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes involved in neuroinflammation was similar for all three strains, and the small differences observed correlated with variations in the early disease tempo. Gene upregulation correlated with activation of both astroglia and microglia detected in early disease prior to vacuolar pathology or clinical signs.
The 3D organization of chromosomes is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long and densely packed—topologically constrained—polymers, making it challenging to develop adequate models and simulation methods to investigate the multi spatio-temporal scales of such macromolecules. We proposed a generic strategy to develop efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for the polymer entanglement length and the volumic density. Our simulation scheme captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of the system and tracks the same dynamics at different coarse-graining levels. This strategy offers a strong power-law gain in numerical efficiency and a systematic way to define reliable coarse-grained null models for chromosomes. We use our formalism to investigate the time evolution of the 3D organization of chromosome 3R ( 20 Mbp ) in drosophila during one cell cycle ( 20 hours ). We show that a combination of our coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model integrating epigenomic-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predicts that chromatin motion is very dynamic during the cell cycle.
The cell type specificity of expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTLs ), which are genetic variants that influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription, presents a problem for understanding the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation. eQTLs are increasingly used to provide mechanistic interpretations for genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) associations. However, eQTL data exist for a limited number of cell types, and the cell type from which a given physiological phenotype arises may not be known. Therefore, it is critical to quantify and understand the mechanisms generating cell type specific eQTLs. To address this need, we performed an eQTL analysis in three parts: first, we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element ( CRE ) data from the ENCODE project; finally we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We found that eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs.
The HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 is a major target for the development of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( bN-mAbs ). These antibodies recognize epitopes consisting of both amino acid and glycan residues, and the glycans required for binding are early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. However, standard Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cell lines used for biopharmaceutical production incorporate complex and hybrid glycosylation, making it challenging to produce vaccine immunogens that display these glycan-dependent epitopes. Here, we report the development of a stable suspension-adapted CHO cell line that limits glycosylation to mannose-5 ( Man5 ) and earlier intermediates. This cell line was created using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system and contains a mutation that inactivates the MGAT1 gene, which is involved in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. Monomeric gp120s produced in the MGAT1− CHO cell line exhibit improved binding to prototypic glycan-dependent bN-mAbs, such as PG9, PGT128, and 10–1074, while preserving the structure of the important glycan-independent epitopes, such as VRC01. The ability of the MGAT1− CHO cell line to limit glycosylation to early intermediates without impairing the doubling time or ability to grow at high cell densities suggests that it will be a useful substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens.
Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase ( T6PP ) from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi has been identified as a promising target for the development of anthelmintic drugs. T6PP is essential for nematode survival due to the toxic effects of trehalose 6-phosphate accumulation, and is also conserved in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We determined the X-ray crystal structure of T6PP from B. malayi, which revealed a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2B-type HAD phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses using a designed competitive inhibitor, trehalose 6-sulfate, identified five residues important for binding and catalysis. The structure-function analysis provided the basis for a proposed model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex, indicating a substrate-binding mode driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions. This mode of binding is distinct from the homolog sucrose-6-phosphate phosphatase, where extensive hydrogen-bond interactions are made to the substrate. These results suggest that high-affinity inhibitors will be bi-dentate, taking advantage of substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl-binding pocket while simultaneously utilizing non-native binding to the trehalose pocket.
We present a novel computational framework for simulating vascular blood flow and interstitial fluid transport in whole, realistic tumours extracted ex vivo. Our model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, and incorporates spatially heterogeneous blood vessel lumen and interstitial permeabilities to generate accurate predictions of tumour fluid dynamics. Our platform enables highly-controlled experiments to be performed which provide insight into how tumour vascular heterogeneity contributes to tumour fluid transport. We detail the application of our framework to an orthotopic murine glioma ( GL261 ) and a human colorectal carcinoma ( LS147T ), and perform sensitivity analysis to gain an understanding of the key biological mechanisms which determine tumour fluid transport. Our results show that incorporating realistic tumour vasculature is key to accurately predicting the spatial flow heterogeneities induced by blood vessels. We also show that reducing tumour interstitial fluid pressure is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion and that therapies should seek to develop an interstitial fluid pressure gradient. Finally, we suggest that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumours.
HIV-1 is known to spread through both cell-free and cell-cell transmission modes. However, the relative importance of cell-cell transmission in natural infection and its vulnerability to inhibition by neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors has not been resolved. Here, we report on the activity of neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors during cell-cell transmission using experimental strategies that enable discrimination between the two transmission routes. We demonstrate that the activity of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) and entry inhibitors varies depending on their mode of action. While gp41 directed agents remain active, CD4 binding site ( CD4bs ) directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, dramatically lose potency during cell-cell transmission. This implies that CD4bs mAbs act preferentially through blocking free virus transmission, while still allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. This provides a plausible explanation for how HIV maintains infectivity and rapidly escapes potent and broadly active CD4bs directed antibody responses in vivo. Our analyses provide compelling evidence that neutralizing antibodies differ in their capacity to block free virus and cell-cell transmission depending on their mode of action.
Visual attention has been shown to produce complex changes in neural responses, including changes in firing rates and receptive field structure. Existing models of attention suggest that these effects arise from selective modulation of neural inputs. However, anatomical and physiological observations suggest that attentional modulation targets higher levels of the visual system, such as V4 or MT, rather than input areas, such as V1. Here, we propose a simple mechanistic model that explains how a top-down attentional modulation, falling on higher visual areas, can produce the observed effects of attention on neural responses. Our model requires only the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. Feedback connections redistribute the top-down modulation to lower areas, which in turn alters the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation. This produces firing rate modulations and receptive field shifts. Simultaneously, short-range lateral inhibition between neighboring cells produces competitive effects that are automatically scaled to receptive field size in any given area. Our model reproduces the observed attentional effects on response rates and receptive field structure without modifying model parameters.
In Drosophila, the posterior signalling centre ( PSC ) is a small group of cells that controls hemocyte homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The PSC acts in a non–cell-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription ( JAK/STAT ) signalling in hematopoietic progenitors ( prohemocytes ), thereby preserving their multipotent character necessary for differentiation into lamellocytes, a specific immune cell type required to fight wasp parasitism. We show that a short type I cytokine-related receptor, CG14225/Latran, is required for switching off JAK/STAT signalling in prohemocytes upon wasp parasitisation. Latran forms heteromers with Domeless, the Drosophila type I cytokine signalling receptor related to mammalian GP130, and antagonises Domeless activity in a dose-dependent manner. Upon wasp parasitism, there is a strong decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph gland, followed by an increase in the latran/domeless ratio. We propose that this sequence of events culminates in the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signalling by Latran.
Begomoviruses, a family of single-stranded DNA viruses, exhibit high rates of genetic recombination. We investigated recombination patterns during experimental co-infections of tomato plants with the begomoviruses Tomato yellow leaf curl virus ( TYLCV ) and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus ( TLCV ) over 120 days. We found that recombination patterns between these viruses can be highly complex, with some recombinant genomes containing up to 58 detectable recombination breakpoints. We show that local degrees of sequence similarity, but not genomic secondary structure, strongly influence where recombination breakpoints occur. Furthermore, we found that selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-genomic interactions, such as those required for protein and nucleic acid folding, strongly influences overall patterns of recombination. We also found that selection favoring the preservation of co-evolved protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions is so strong that it can be used to identify the exact sequence tracts involved in these interactions.
Nucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, have been suggested to influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes by altering the propensity of DNA to mutate and by selection acting to maintain or exclude nucleosomes in particular locations. Here, we show that despite fundamental differences between eukaryotic and archaeal nucleosomes, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is strikingly conserved between humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. We compare substitution patterns around nucleosome footprints in humans to substitution dynamics in the Haloferax clade, a group of halophilic archaea. We find that neither the mutation nor the selection model are sufficient to explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence divergence. Instead, we demonstrate that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are more consistent with a third model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. We show that nucleosome repositioning is both necessary and largely sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution patterns. This finding highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
Conformational diversity of the native state of a protein plays a central role in modulating protein function. The conformational selection model for ligand binding is based on the co-existence of conformers with different ligand-affinities in a dynamical equilibrium. Conformational diversity involves a dynamical equilibrium between conformers with lower ( ligand-free ) and higher ( ligand-bound ) affinities for the ligand. Internal protein motions guarantee the interconversion between them. Due to its relevance to protein function, conformational diversity associated to ligand binding should be evolutionary conserved. Here, we present a novel procedure to identify key positions whose mutations have a significant effect on vibrational normal modes involved in the ligand-free to ligand-bound conformational changes. We have applied our method to a refined dataset of paired protein structures in the ligand-free and ligand-bound form. Our findings allow us to identify key positions for the evolutionary conservation of the protein conformational diversity required for ligand binding. These positions are dynamically important residues that mediate the ligand-binding conformational change and are mostly buried aliphatic residues localized in regular structural regions of the protein like β-sheets and α-helix.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), the causative agent of tuberculosis ( TB ), has evolved to replicate and survive in diverse host environments by adapting its metabolic pathways to efficiently catabolize multiple carbon sources. Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase ( FBA ) is central to both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in Mtb. We investigated the role of FBA by engineering an Mtb strain in which FBA levels were regulated by anhydrotetracycline. We found that depletion of FBA resulted in clearance of Mtb in both the acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo, and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, this essentiality could be overcome when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources. In vitro studies revealed that lack of FBA could only be compensated for by a specific balance of glucose and butyrate, in which growth and metabolism of butyrate were dependent on Mtb's ability to co-catabolize glucose. These findings not only evaluate FBA as a potential drug target in both replicating and persistent Mtb, but also expand our understanding of the multiplicity of in vitro conditions that define the essentiality of Mtb's FBA in vivo.
Leishmania is a protozoan parasite that causes leishmaniasis in humans and animals. In this study, we investigated the role of the mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin ( mTXNPx ) in the Leishmania infantum life cycle. mTXNPx is a member of the 2-Cys peroxiredoxin family, which is involved in peroxide removal in many organisms. However, Leishmania lacks catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, suggesting that 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are essential for peroxide removal in this parasite. We generated mTXNPx null mutants ( mtxnpx− ) by gene replacement and found that they were unable to thrive in a murine model of infection. Unexpectedly, the avirulent phenotype of mtxnpx− was not due to the lack of peroxidase activity of mTXNPx, as these mutants behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants added exogenously or generated by macrophages during phagocytosis ex vivo. In addition, mtxnpx− were avirulent when inoculated into murine hosts unable to mount an effective oxidative phagocyte response. To definitively conclude that the peroxidase activity of mTXNPx is not required for parasite survival in mice, we showed that a peroxidase-inactive version of this protein was competent in rescuing the non-infective phenotype of mtxnpx−. We propose that mTXNPx has a novel function as a molecular chaperone, which may explain the impaired infectivity of the null mutants.
Histoplasma urine antigen ( HUAg ) is the preferred method for diagnosing progressive disseminated histoplasmosis ( PDH ) in HIV patients. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA ( ALPHA-HUAg ) in a multicenter, prospective study of 288 HIV patients suspected of having PDH in Mexico. We compared the results of ALPHA-HUAg to the reference standard of Histoplasma capsulatum growth on blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or compatible histopathologic examination. We found that the sensitivity of ALPHA-HUAg was 67. 1% ( 95% CI, 56–76. 8% ) and the specificity was 97. 5% ( 95% CI, 94. 3–99. 1% ). The positive likelihood ratio was 27. 2 ( 95% CI; 11. 6–74. 4 ). In 10. 5% of the PDH–proven patients, a co-existing opportunistic infection was diagnosed, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection. We observed a high specificity but low sensitivity of IMMY-HUAg. The test may be useful to start early antifungals, but a culture-based approach is necessary since co-infections are frequent and a negative IMMY-HUAg result does not rule out PDH.
Diarrhea is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, resulting in approximately 1. 8 million deaths annually. However, in up to 40% of cases, no etiologic agent can be identified. The advent of metagenomic sequencing has enabled the systematic and unbiased characterization of microbial populations, including viruses, present in stool during episodes of acute diarrhea. In this study, we employed a strategy of “micro-mass sequencing” to characterize the eukaryotic viral communities present in diarrhea specimens from 12 children. This approach entails minimal starting sample quantity ( <100 mg stool ), minimal sample purification, and limited sequencing ( 384 reads per sample ). Using this methodology, we detected known enteric viruses as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with only limited sequence similarity to viruses in GenBank. Our results demonstrate that micro-mass sequencing can define the diversity of viral communities found in fecal samples from diarrhea patients. Both known viruses and novel viruses were detected by sequencing only a few hundred colonies from each sample library. These findings will serve as the springboard for future studies aimed at assessing whether any novel or unexpected viruses detected play a causal role in human diarrhea.
Zika and dengue are two arboviruses transmitted by the Aedes mosquito that have precipitated large epidemics worldwide. In the Dominican Republic, a large dengue outbreak in 2015/2016 was followed by a Zika outbreak, providing an opportunity to study the transmission dynamics of these two flaviviruses. Using national surveillance data, we compared the age and sex distributions of Zika and dengue cases, as well as the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome ( GBS ). We found that 75% of dengue cases occurred in individuals under 20 years of age, while Zika infections were more widely dispersed among the population. Dengue attack rates were marginally higher among males, while Zika infections were highly clustered among females. Age-adjusted Zika attack rates were 7. 64 per 10, 000 population among females compared to 2. 72 per 10, 000 population among males. The reproductive number ( R0 ) of Zika was also higher among females. However, GBS attack rates were slightly higher among males. We found little evidence that existing dengue immunity affected Zika attack rates at the population level. Our findings suggest that community awareness campaigns may have influenced the increased reporting of Zika cases among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out.
Poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 2 ( PARP2 ) is the predominant enzyme responsible for poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in response to DNA damage and immune responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Unlike in animals, where PARP1 is the major contributor to poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation, PARP2 plays the major role in Arabidopsis. PARP2 is structurally distinct from PARP1, carrying SAP DNA binding motifs rather than the zinc finger domains found in plant and animal PARP1 proteins. We found that knockout of PARP2 rather than PARP1 severely depleted detectable PARP activity in Arabidopsis, with only marginal elevation of poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ated proteins detected after bleomycin treatment of parp2-1 mutant plants. In contrast, knockout of PARP1 had little effect on poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation activity in Arabidopsis. We also found that PARG1 rather than PARG2 is the primary enzyme that counteracts poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation in Arabidopsis. In addition, we discovered that PARP1 associates with PARP2, and that PARP1 and PARP2 interact with both PARG1 and PARG2. Overall, our results indicate that Arabidopsis PARP2 and PARG1 play the predominant roles in plant poly ( ADP-ribosyl ) ation during DNA damage and immune responses.
The C. elegans PHR protein, RPM-1, regulates synapse formation and axon termination by acting as a ubiquitin ligase to inhibit the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways. We have identified a new MAP kinase pathway that suppresses synapse formation defects in rpm-1 mutants, but not axon termination defects, in the mechanosensory neurons. This pathway includes MIG-15 ( MAP4K ), NSY-1 ( MAP3K ), JKK-1 ( MAP2K ), and JNK-1 ( MAPK ). The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons and is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals. Transgenic overexpression of MIG-15, NSY-1, or JKK-1 causes synapse formation defects at a similar frequency. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. These findings indicate that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning.
Evolutionary Change within a Bipotential Switch Shaped the Sperm/Oocyte Decision in Hermaphroditic Nematodes. The sex-determination protein TRA-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae is a bipotential transcription factor that can activate or repress the same target gene depending on the signal from upstream genes. TRR-1, a co-factor of TRA-1, is required for spermatogenesis in C. briggsae and works as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetyl Transferase complex to promote the expression of Cbr-fog-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. TRR-1 also regulates the development of the male tail and works through TRA-1 to activate Cbr-fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision. In C. briggsae, TRR-1 null mutants prevent hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, but in C. elegans, Cel-trr-1 mutants do not prevent spermatogenesis. However, synthetic interactions confirm that both halves of the switch exist in each species. Thus, the relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can shift rapidly during evolution, so that the same phenotype is produced by alternative, complementary mechanisms.
Integrated information is a measure that quantifies the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states, possibly reflecting levels of consciousness generated by neural systems. However, the current measure of integrated information, ΦDM, is defined only for discrete Markov systems, which are rare in biology. Here, we describe two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, that overcome these limitations and are easy to apply to time-series data. We use simulations to demonstrate the in-practice applicability of our measures, and to explore their properties. Our results provide new opportunities for examining information integration in real and model systems, and carry implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes. However, our findings pose challenges for theories that ascribe physical meaning to the measured quantities. We critically evaluate integrated information, a candidate measure that has received significant recent attention, especially in the domain of consciousness science. Our measures are framed in terms of process, and are easy to apply in practice, permitting the framing of testable hypotheses, and the specification of synthetic models, aimed at examining the role of integrated information in neurocognitive processes broadly construed.
Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) has been spreading in Uganda in recent years, raising concerns of a potential overlap with the Gambian form of the disease. Recent research has focused on the environmental and climatic factors that control the spatial distribution of the disease. A previous study used simple logistic regression methods to explore the relationship between HAT prevalence and several social, environmental and climatic variables in two of the most recently affected districts of Uganda. The study suggested that the disease had spread into the study area due to the movement of infected, untreated livestock. Here, we extend this study to account for spatial autocorrelation, incorporate uncertainty in input data and model parameters, and undertake predictive mapping for risk of high HAT prevalence in the future. Using a Bayesian geostatistical model, we demonstrate a more rigorous analytical approach, potentially resulting in more accurate parameter and significance estimates and increased predictive accuracy. Our analysis strongly supports the theory that Rhodesian HAT was imported to the study area via the movement of untreated, infected livestock from endemic areas. We also confirm the confounding effect of health care accessibility on the spatial distribution of Rhodesian HAT and the linkages between the disease's distribution and minimum land surface temperature. Predictive mapping indicates an increased risk of high HAT prevalence in the future in areas surrounding livestock markets, demonstrating the importance of livestock trading for continuing disease spread.
The feasibility of equilibria in large ecosystems is a neglected concept in the complexity-stability debate. Previous approaches assume the existence of a feasible equilibrium, i. e. with positive abundances, but this assumption has not been tested. We provide analytical results and simulations showing that equilibrium feasibility vanishes in species-rich systems. This leaves us in an uncomfortable situation in which the existence of a feasible equilibrium assumed in local stability criteria is far from granted. We extend our analyses by changing interaction structure and intensity, and find that feasibility and stability are warranted irrespective of species richness with weak interactions. Interestingly, we find that the dynamical behaviour of ecologically inspired architectures is very different and richer than that of unstructured systems. Our results suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires focusing on the interplay between interaction strength and network architecture. We show that, in situations compatible with previous works, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is not guaranteed, since the probability to observe such a point decreases exponentially towards zero as the size of the network grows. We also find that with weak interactions, non-trivial feasible equilibria are found only in ecologically-inspired systems, in a way that is ecologically sensible.
The sero-epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, was investigated in humans and cattle in Western Kenya. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 416 homesteads, where serum samples from 2049 humans and 955 cattle were tested for C. burnetii antibodies. The overall sero-prevalence of C. burnetii was 2. 5% in humans and 10. 5% in cattle. However, there was no evidence of correlation between cattle and human seroprevalence at the household level or when accounting for spatial proximity between households. This suggests that human exposure to C. burnetii may occur due to contact with or environmental contamination by livestock owned by other households. Multilevel regression analysis indicated that several factors were associated with exposure to C. burnetii in both humans and cattle. In humans, the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, and frequent livestock contact was a risk factor. In cattle, those obtained from market and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels had the highest sero-prevalence.
Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease, is a blood fluke whose genome has been sequenced. To identify the role and importance of newly described schistosome genes, functional genomic approaches are being developed. Transgenesis is an established tool for functional genomics in model species, which can lead to gain- or loss-of-functions, facilitate vector-based RNA interference, and represent an effective forward genetics tool for insertional mutagenesis screens. However, progress toward routine transgenesis in schistosomes might be expedited if germ cells could be reliably localized in cultured schistosomes. Vasa, a member of the ATP-dependent DEAD-box RNA helicase family, is a prototypic marker of primordial germ cells and the germ line in the Metazoa. Using bioinformatics, 33 putative DEAD-box RNA helicases exhibiting conserved motifs that characterize helicases of this family were identified in the S. mansoni genome. Three of these helicases exhibited vasa-like sequences and were termed Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 were members of the Vasa/PL10 DEAD-box subfamily. Expression of Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3 was detected in developmental stages of S. mansoni with elevated expression in sporocysts, adult females, eggs, and miracidia, with strikingly high expression in the undeveloped egg.
VGLL4 plays a critical role in heart valve development and homeostasis. We found that VGLL4 is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) stage and is maintained until the adult stage. Tissue-specific knockout of VGLL4 in different cell lineages revealed that only loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cell lineage led to valve malformation with expanded expression of YAP targets. Further studies showed that loss of VGLL4 in endothelial cells resulted in abnormal arterial valve morphology and severe cardiac hypertrophy in 36-week-old mice, while semi-knockout of YAP rescued heart malformation induced by VGLL4 deletion. Altogether, our study shows that VGLL4 and precisely regulated Hippo signaling are required for proper heart valve remodeling and maturation. Thus, Hippo signaling in valve endothelial cells is required for post-EMT semilunar valve morphogenesis and homeostasis. Precise regulation of the Hippo pathway is required for proper proliferation of endocardium-derived mesenchymal cells and subsequent valve elongation. We identified a previously unknown function of VGLL4 in valve remodeling and homeostasis and suggest that mutations in VGLL4 may underlie human congenital heart valve dysplasia.
Since the initial description of the genomic patterns expected under models of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation and on multiple beneficial mutations—so-called soft selective sweeps—researchers have sought to identify these patterns in natural population data. Over the past two years, large-scale data analyses have argued that soft sweeps are pervasive across organisms of very different effective population size and mutation rate—humans, Drosophila, and HIV. However, others have evaluated the relevance of these models to natural populations, as well as the identifiability of the models relative to other known population-level processes, arguing that soft sweeps are likely to be rare. Here, we look to reconcile these opposing results by carefully evaluating three recent studies and their underlying methodologies. Using population genetic theory, as well as extensive simulation, we find that all three examples are prone to extremely high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps serve as the more parsimonious explanation. These findings represent a necessary response to the growing tendency of invoking parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of pervasive positive selection, and neglecting best practices regarding the construction of proper demographic null models.
Host-seeking behavior in female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for dengue fever, is known to be inhibited for three days following a blood meal by a hemolymph-borne humoral factor. Head Peptide-I is a candidate peptide mediating this suppression, but the mechanism by which this peptide alters mosquito behavior and the receptor through which it signals are unknown. We identified eight Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptors ( NPYLRs ) in the Ae. aegypti genome and screened each in a cell-based calcium imaging assay for sensitivity against a panel of peptides. Four of the Ae. aegypti NPYLRs responded to one or more peptide ligands, but only NPYLR1 responded to Head Peptide-I as well as sNPFs. Injection of synthetic Head Peptide-I and sNPF-3 inhibited host-seeking behavior in non-blood-fed female mosquitoes. To ask if NPYLR1 is necessary for blood-feeding-induced host-seeking inhibition, we used zinc-finger nucleases to generate five independent npylr1 null mutant strains and tested them for behavioral abnormalities. npylr1 mutants displayed normal behavior in locomotion, egg laying, sugar feeding, blood feeding, host seeking, and inhibition of host seeking after a blood meal.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease that can be influenced by environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, land surface temperature, land use/cover, and rainfall. This study aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission in Akure North Local Government Area ( LGA ) of Ondo State, Nigeria, using satellite derived environmental data and spatial analysis. The study used multicriteria evaluation ( MCE ) and Saaty’s analytical hierarchy process ( AHP ) to obtain the mapping weight or importance of each individual schistosomiasis risk factor. The study focused on temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/land cover as the factors controlling schistosomiasis incidence in the study area. These factors were reclassified and overlaid to identify areas vulnerable to schistosomiasis. The prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in the study area was also determined by parasitological analysis of urine samples collected through random sampling. The results showed a varying risk of schistosomiasis, with 82% of the area falling under the high and very high risk category. The study also showed that one community ( Oba Ile ) had the lowest risk of schistosomiasis, while the risk increased in the four remaining communities ( Iju, Igoba, Ita Ogbolu, and Ogbese ).
Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcal ) meningitis is the most common form of bacterial meningitis, with a patient survival rate of 75% and half of the patients suffering from long-term disabilities. Pneumolysin ( PLY ) is a critical pneumococcal pathogenic factor that belongs to the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin ( CDC ) group. Our studies demonstrate a pathogenic cascade linking the presence of PLY with glutamate release and the subsequent, NMDA-dependent dendritic and synaptic pathology associated with pneumococcal meningitis. We show that PLY induces glutamate release from astrocytes in a calcium-dependent manner, which we speculate to be a major source of elevated brain glutamate in pneumococcal meningitis and meningitis model systems. We further demonstrate that PLY causes permanent dendritic swelling, dendritic spine elimination, and synaptic loss in mouse brain slices at disease-relevant, non-lytic concentrations. The NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and D-AP5 reduce this pathology, suggesting that PLY-induced glutamate release leads to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. We propose that PLY plays a significant synapto- and dendritotoxic role in pneumococcal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers. To develop new means to prevent HPV infections, such as vaccines and microbicides, a better understanding of the infectious life cycle of HPVs is required. The infectious life cycle of HPVs is closely linked to the differentiation state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus only made in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment. It has been recognized that HPV must first establish its infection within the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but why this is the case has not been understood. Here, we used chemical biology approaches to reveal that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. Using infectious HPV16 particles containing the intact viral genome, G1-synchronized human keratinocytes as hosts, and early viral gene expression as a readout for infection, we learned that the recipient cell must enter M phase ( mitosis ) for HPV infection to take place. Late M phase inhibitors had no effect on infection, whereas G1, S, G2, and early M phase cell cycle inhibitors efficiently prevented infection. We conclude that host cells need to pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. These findings provide one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia.
Penicillium marneffei is the most important thermal dimorphic fungus causing systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. We hypothesized that miRNA-like RNAs ( milRNAs ) may be expressed in P. marneffei and involved in the regulation of thermal dimorphism. We used high-throughput sequencing technology to identify milRNAs in P. marneffei in both mycelial and yeast phases. We identified 24 potential milRNA candidates, which were more abundantly expressed in mycelial than yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding putative Dicer-like proteins and the gene, qde-2, encoding Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 of P. marneffei was more closely related to the homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp. Moreover, dcl-2 demonstrated higher mRNA expression levels in mycelial than yeast phase by 7 folds ( P<0. 001 ). Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in mycelial phase. Using dcl-1KO, dcl-2KO, dclDKO and qde-2KO deletion mutants, we showed that the biogenesis of both milRNAs were dependent on dcl-2 but not dcl-1 or qde-2. Our findings provided the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.
Zika virus ( ZIKV ) emerged in French Polynesia in 2013 and spread through the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. The main arbovirus vector in the region, Aedes aegypti, and the secondary vector of dengue virus, Aedes polynesiensis, may have contributed to the transmission of ZIKV. This study aimed to evaluate and compare the vector competence of wild Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis populations from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain that circulated in the region during the 2013–2017 outbreak. Field Ae. aegypti ( three populations ) and Ae. polynesiensis ( two populations ) from the Pacific region were collected and orally exposed to ZIKV ( 107 TCID50/mL ) isolated in the region in 2014. The results showed that ZIKV infection rates were heterogeneous between the Ae. aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogeneous between these populations. For Ae. polynesiensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study. Our results indicated a low ZIKV transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis tested from the Pacific region.
Xist is a long non-coding RNA ( lncRNA ) that plays a central role in the regulation of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. To understand how Xist and other lncRNAs function, it is essential to study their secondary and higher-order structures. We developed a new approach called Targeted Structure-Seq, which combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing. This approach enriches for signals from the RNA of interest, providing high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads. We used Targeted Structure-Seq to probe the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5’-end of Xist. Our analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function. We validated the utility of Targeted Structure-Seq to study lncRNA conformation in mammalian cells and expect that this approach will be useful for advancing our mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs.
In this study, we develop a novel statistical framework to evaluate the performance of genetic risk prediction models for complex diseases. Previous studies have mainly used the area under the receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve, or AUC, to judge the predictive value of genetic tests. However, AUC has its limitations and should be complemented by other measures. We show that given the overall disease prevalence and total variance in liability explained by the set of susceptibility variants, it is possible to estimate analytically a large variety of prediction metrics. These metrics include the AUC, the mean risk difference between cases and non-cases, the net reclassification improvement ( ability to reclassify people into high- and low-risk categories ), the proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk, the variance of predicted risks, and the risk at any percentile. We also demonstrate how to construct graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, such as the ROC curve, the density of risks, and the predictiveness curve ( disease risk plotted against risk percentile ). The results from simulations match very well with our theoretical estimates. We apply the methodology to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait.
Trypanosoma brucei gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) is a vector-borne, neglected tropical disease that puts 70 million people living in sub-Saharan African countries at risk. The most common form of the disease is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite T. b. gambiense, which in 2015 accounted for more than 97% of all reported HAT cases. Diagnosis and treatment are central elements of strategies to control HAT, and serological screening is a key entry point in diagnostic algorithms. The Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis ( CATT ) has been the most widely used screening test for decades, but it has a number of practical limitations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of a new rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) developed using recombinant antigens ( SD BIOLINE HAT 2. 0 ), in comparison with an RDT produced using native antigens ( SD BIOLINE HAT ) and CATT. A total of 57, 632 individuals were screened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and 260 HAT cases were confirmed by parasitology. The highest sensitivity was achieved with the SD BIOLINE HAT 2. 0 ( 71. 2% ), followed by CATT ( 62. 5% ) and the SD BIOLINE HAT ( 59. 0% ). Combining two or three tests resulted in a markedly increased sensitivity: when the SD BIOLINE HAT was combined with the SD BIOLINE HAT 2. 0, sensitivity reached 98. 4% in passive and 83. 0% in active screening.
Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease endemic to Latin America, has been effectively controlled in most of Guatemala after multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying ( IRS ). However, a few foci remain with persistent Triatoma dimidiata infestation, including the municipality of Comapa in the southeastern region of Guatemala. We carried out three cross-sectional entomological and serological surveys in Comapa between 1999 and 2015 to evaluate a decade of vector control activities. After multiple rounds of IRS, the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% ( 2001–2 ) to 27% ( 2011 ). Household construction materials alone predicted <10% of infested houses. Chagas seroprevalence in school-aged children declined by 10–fold, from 10% ( 1999 ) to 1% ( 2015 ). However, seroprevalence in women of childbearing age remains >10%. The continued risk for vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. Systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are needed to reach the elimination goal in regions with persistent vector infestation.
Citrobacter rodentium is a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing ( A/E ) lesions and shares a common virulence strategy with the clinically significant human pathogens enteropathogenic E. coli ( EPEC ) and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli ( EHEC ). We previously reported the complete genome sequence of C. rodentium strain ICC168, which displayed characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen. In this study, we found that the genome of C. rodentium is unstable as a result of repeat-mediated, large-scale genome recombination and active transposition of mobile genetic elements such as prophages. We sequenced an additional C. rodentium strain, EX-33, and found that the reference strain ICC168 is representative of the species and that most of the inactivating mutations were common to both isolates and likely to have occurred early on in the evolution of this pathogen. We draw parallels with the evolution of other bacterial pathogens and conclude that C. rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen that may have emerged alongside the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. The genome of C. rodentium displays features associated with bacteria that have recently passed through an evolutionary bottleneck, including a large number of pseudogenes and IS elements.
Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression give rise to distributions of protein levels across cell populations. We propose a method for inferring sets of biochemical rate constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from stochasticity in protein expression. We derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution and found that these four moments completely capture the shape of protein distributions. We developed an efficient algorithm for inferring gene expression rate constants from the moments of protein distributions. Using this algorithm, we find that most protein distributions are consistent with a large number of different biochemical rate constant sets. Despite this degeneracy, the solution space of rate constants almost always informs on underlying mechanism. For example, we distinguish between regimes where transcriptional bursting occurs from regimes reflecting constitutive transcript production. Our method agrees with the current standard approach, and in the restrictive regime where the standard method operates, also identifies rate constants not previously obtainable. Even without making any assumptions we obtain estimates of individual biochemical rate constants, or meaningful ratios of rate constants, in 91% of tested cases.
Smallpox vaccination has been shown to provide good protection against monkeypox virus ( MPXV ) in animal models and humans. However, most first- and second-generation smallpox vaccines are associated with morbidity and are contraindicated for a large proportion of the population. Third-generation vaccines, such as modified vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ), have been shown to be safer in non-human primates but require two administrations for complete protection. MPXV is an emerging orthopoxvirus zoonosis in the tropical rain forest of Africa and is endemic in the Congo-basin and sporadic in West Africa. The virus has a broad-host range and is capable of infecting many animal species. Cases of human MPX are increasing in Africa, which may be due to increasing interactions between humans and infected animals, cessation of routine vaccination against smallpox, increase in human susceptibility to the virus, increase in animal-human and human-human transmissibility of the virus, and adaptation of the virus to new host species. There are no FDA-approved therapies against MPXV, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. In this study, a new vaccination strategy based on three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 ( BoHV-4 ) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, was investigated in terms of protection from a lethal MPXV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. The results showed that BoHV-4-A-EF1α-M1RgD106ΔTK alone or in combination with BoHV-4-A-CMV-A29LgD106ΔTK and BoHV-4-A-EF1α-B6RgD106ΔTK was able to protect 100% and 80% of STAT1 ( -/- ) mice against mortality and morbidity, respectively.
Trypanosomes lack homologues to all subunits of the decapping complex, but instead use an ApaH-like phosphatase, TbALPH1, as their major mRNA decapping enzyme. TbALPH1 localises to a special granule at the posterior pole of the cell and co-localises exclusively with the 5’-3’ exoribonuclease XRNA. RNAi depletion of TbALPH1 is lethal and causes a massive increase in total mRNAs that are deadenylated but have not yet started 5’-3’ decay. This suggests that TbALPH1 acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of mRNA degradation, consistent with a function in mRNA decapping. In vitro experiments show that recombinant, N-terminally truncated TbALPH1 protein sensitises the capped trypanosome spliced leader RNA to yeast Xrn1, but only if an RNA 5’ polyphosphatase is included. This indicates that the decapping mechanism of TbALPH1 differs from the decapping mechanism of Dcp2 by leaving more than one phosphate group at the mRNA’s 5’ end. This is the first reported function of a eukaryotic ApaH-like phosphatase, a bacterial-derived class of enzymes present in all phylogenetic super-groups of the eukaryotic kingdom.
The inactivation of the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells is sufficient to trigger their neogenesis and conversion into functional β-like cells at any age. Using a combination of conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches, we show that the selective inhibition of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to promote the conversion of adult α-cells into β-like cells. Interestingly, this conversion induces the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, the glucagon+ cells thereby generated being subsequently converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. Importantly, the loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and thereby reverse diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion. Our data therefore suggest that strategies aiming at inhibiting the expression of Arx, or its molecular targets/co-factors, may pave new avenues for the treatment of diabetes.
Replication origins in eukaryotic cells must be tightly regulated to prevent re-initiation, which can lead to genomic alterations. It has been assumed that all origins are inhibited identically by global mechanisms that reduce the activity of replication initiation proteins. However, we have found that origins re-initiate with diverse efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled, suggesting an additional layer of control that can differentially regulate re-initiation at distinct origins. We have identified novel genetic elements that are necessary for preferential re-initiation of two origins and sufficient to confer preferential re-initiation on heterologous origins when the control of re-initiation is partially deregulated. These elements, which we term re-initiation promoters ( RIPs ), map to ∼60 bp AT rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. The RIPs do not enhance the S phase timing or efficiency of adjacent origins and thus are specifically acting as re-initiation promoters. Our findings suggest that the RIP elements can overcome a block to re-initiation imposed after Mcm2-7 associates with origins. This local level of control creates a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential that is revealed when global mechanisms preventing re-replication are compromised.
Invasive amebiasis ( IA ) caused by Entamoeba histolytica is an emerging problem in developed East Asian countries, particularly among men who have sex with men ( MSM ) co-infected with HIV-1. A retrospective analysis of the medical records of 170 HIV-1-infected patients with IA was conducted to characterize the clinical and epidemiological features of the disease in this population. The results showed that the clinical presentation of IA in HIV-1-infected patients was similar to that in the general population, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein ( CRP ) levels associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. The outcome of treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was excellent for uncomplicated amebiasis in HIV-1-infected individuals. However, luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment did not reduce the recurrence of amebiasis in high-risk populations. Recurrence was more frequent in patients who were HCV-antibody positive and those who acquired syphilis during the follow-up period. Various genotypes of E. histolytica were identified in 14 patients, but there was no correlation between genotype and clinical features. The results emphasize the difficulty of preventing IA recurrence without an educational approach to prevent new amebic infection in high-risk groups such as HIV-1-infected MSM.
Sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ), is a neglected tropical disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense transmitted by tsetse flies. In Chad, the Mandoul area is a persistent focus of HAT where around 100 cases were diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. We assessed whether adding tsetse control to case detection and treatment could further reduce transmission and incidence of HAT in Mandoul. We deployed ‘tiny targets’ that attract and kill tsetse in the riverine habitats of tsetse in 2014, 2015, and 2016. We conducted nine tsetse monitoring surveys and four medical surveys of the human population in 2014 and 2015, and used mathematical modelling to assess the relative impact of tsetse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening. Our results show that tsetse control reduced the catch of tsetse from 0. 7 flies/trap/day to 0. 005 tsetse/trap/day. Modelling indicates that 70. 4% ( 95% CI: 51–95% ) of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control, and 62. 8% ( 95% CI: 59–66% ) of the reduction in new infections can be attributed to tsetse control. Our results suggest that tsetse control may have interrupted transmission and that the combination of tsetse control and medical detection and treatment has played a major role in reducing HAT incidence in 2014 and 2015.
Imported strongyloidiasis is increasingly diagnosed in non-endemic areas, including Spain. This study describes the epidemiological, clinical and microbiological characteristics of 1245 patients with imported strongyloidiasis registered in the +REDIVI Spanish Collaborative Network from 2009 to 2017. The majority of patients were immigrants ( 66. 9% ) from South America, and most were asymptomatic. Eosinophilia was present in 82. 2% of cases, and detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21. 9% of patients. Serological tests were used to make the diagnosis in the remaining cases. Treatment with ivermectin was associated with a higher cure rate compared to albendazole ( OR 2. 34 ). The study highlights the importance of screening for S. stercoralis infection in patients coming from or traveling to endemic areas, especially those with immunosuppressant conditions, due to the long latency of the infection and the risk of developing a severe presentation.
Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases, and determining the optimal amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen ( inoculum dose ) is an important component of rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models with experimental data can help determine the impact of the inoculum dose on host immunity and morbidity. We illustrate the concept of using data and models to inform inoculum dose determination for vaccines by fitting a mathematical model to data from influenza A virus ( IAV ) infection of mice and human parainfluenza virus ( HPIV ) infection of cotton rats at different inoculum doses. We use the model to map inoculum dose to the level of immune protection and morbidity and to explore how such a framework might be used to determine an optimal inoculum dose. Our findings illustrate that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can depend on the specific pathogen and that both protection and morbidity do not necessarily increase monotonically with increasing inoculum dose. We develop a modeling framework that might allow a systematic and quantitative determination of the impact of different inoculum doses on resulting immune protection and morbidity. We applied this approach to several data sets to illustrate how the general concept can lead to important insights, e. g. ‘more inoculum does not always lead to more immune protection’.
Anabaena filaments undergo a process of development in response to nitrogen deprivation, resulting in a one-dimensional pattern of nitrogen-fixing heterocysts separated by photosynthetic vegetative cells. The expression of hetR, a transcription factor essential for heterocyst differentiation, has been studied using a chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion. Statistical analysis of fluorescence at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments demonstrates that expression fluctuations of hetR in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic spatial range of circa two to three cells. This sets the scale for cellular interactions along a filament. Correlations between cells predominantly arise from intercellular molecular transfer and less from cell division. We found that under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal, steady-state expression of the HetR inhibitor PatS, cell-cell communication influenced by the septal protein SepJ and positive HetR auto-regulation are essential determinants of fluctuations in hetR expression and its distribution along filaments.
Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) genotype I ( GI ) has replaced genotype III ( GIII ) in China as demonstrated by molecular epidemiological surveillance. We performed a serological survey in JEV-non-vaccinated pigs to confirm JEV genotype shift at the sero-epidemiological level. The average ratio of GI/GIII infection was 1. 87, suggesting co-circulation of GI and GIII infections with GI infection being more prevalent in pigs in China. To gain an insight into the reasons for this JEV genotype shift, we compared the replication kinetics of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates including three GI strains and four GIII strains in mosquito C6/36 cells, chicken fibroblast cells ( DF-1 ) and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells ( PIEC ). We observed that GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in DF-1 and PIEC cells, particularly in DF-1 cells with titers reaching 22. 9–225. 3 fold higher than GIII strains. To examine this enhanced replication efficiency in vivo, young domestic ducklings were used as the animal model and inoculated with GI and GIII strains at day 2 post-hatching. We observed that GI-inoculated ducklings developed higher viremia titers and displayed a comparatively longer viremic duration than GIII-inoculated ducklings. These results conform to the hypothesis of an enhanced replication efficiency for GI viruses in birds.
Candida albicans biofilm formation is regulated by an integrated network of six transcription factors: Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1. To understand how these transcription factors function together to regulate biofilm formation, we used a systematic genetic interaction approach based on generating all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and quantitatively analyzing the genetic interactions between them. We found that the network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with all six network heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation ( haploinsufficiency ). In addition, many double heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions. The network shows properties of a highly interdependent ‘small-world’ network that is highly efficient but not robust. We found that TEC1 represents a network component whose expression is highly sensitive to small perturbations in the function of other network transcription factors. We also found that expression of ROB1 is dependent on both auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other network transcription factors. Finally, we found that the heterozygous NDT80 deletion mutant is hyperfilamentous under both biofilm and hyphae-inducing conditions in a TEC1-dependent manner.
Leishmania infantum asparagine synthetase A ( LiAS-A ) is an enzyme responsible for converting aspartate into asparagine in an ATP-dependent manner, using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. Although LiAS-A is absent in humans and present in trypanosomatids, making it a potential drug target candidate, we demonstrate that it is not essential for parasite survival, growth, or infectivity in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. We generated LiAS-A null mutants by targeted gene replacement in L. infantum and observed no significant growth or infectivity defect. However, a severe impairment of in vitro growth was observed when null mutants were cultured in asparagine limiting conditions. This suggests that LiAS-A is important under asparagine limitation, but not essential for parasite survival or infectivity in normal conditions. Our results exclude LiAS-A as a suitable drug target against L. infantum parasites.
Toxocariasis, a parasitic infection caused by Toxocara spp., is associated with epilepsy, according to a systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 case-control studies conducted in 13 countries worldwide. The studies included a total of 4740 subjects, of whom 2159 had epilepsy and 2581 did not. The overall pooled odds ratio ( OR ) for the association between epilepsy and Toxocara spp. seropositivity was 1. 69 ( 95% CI 1. 42–2. 01 ), indicating a positive association between the two conditions. Meta-regression showed no statistically significant association between covariates and outcome. The association was consistently reported in the restricted analysis, which included studies that used Western Blot as a confirmatory or diagnostic test, were conducted in younger populations, and were population-based. The results of the meta-analysis provide epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy.
ATM plays a critical role in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ). Here, we describe a novel ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA ( miRNA ) : irradiation ( IR ) -induced DSBs activate ATM, which leads to the downregulation of miR-335, a miRNA that targets CtIP. CtIP is an important trigger of DNA end resection in homologous recombination repair ( HRR ). We demonstrate that CREB is responsible for a large portion of miR-335 expression by binding to the promoter region of miR-335. CREB binding is greatly reduced after IR, corroborating with previous studies that IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CREB to reduce its transcription activity. Overexpression of miR-335 in HeLa cells resulted in reduced CtIP levels and post-IR colony survival and BRCA1 foci formation. In two patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with decreased post-IR colony survival, a “radiosensitive” phenotype, we demonstrated elevated miR-335 expression, reduced CtIP levels, and reduced BRCA1 foci formation. Colony survival, BRCA1 foci, and CtIP levels were partially rescued by miRNA antisense AMO-miR-335 treatment. These findings suggest that an ATM–dependent CREB–miR-335–CtIP axis influences the selection of HRR for repair of certain DSB lesions.
Mentalizing, the process of attributing mental states such as beliefs and emotions to others, plays a crucial role in human social interactions. In this study, we investigated whether mentalizing affects learning in the context of repeated social interactions. We asked participants to play repeated games against artificial mentalizing agents, which differed in their sophistication, in either a social or non-social framing. In the social framing, participants believed they were playing against another person, while in the non-social framing, they believed they were gambling like in a casino. We found that participants won against the artificial mentalizing agents in the social framing, but lost in the non-social framing. Moreover, participants' choice sequences were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social framing. This study is the first demonstration of the added-value of mentalizing on learning in the context of repeated social interactions.
Gaussian graphical model ( GGM ) is a probability model that characterizes the conditional dependence structure of a set of random variables by a graph. GGM has wide applications in the analysis of biological networks, such as inferring interaction or comparing differential networks. However, existing approaches are either not statistically rigorous or are inefficient for high-dimensional data that include tens of thousands of variables for making inference. We propose an efficient algorithm, FastGGM, to implement the estimation of GGM and obtain p-value and confidence interval for each edge in the graph. FastGGM is based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. ( 2015 ) and has been implemented in an R package named “FastGGM”. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that FastGGM is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current implemented algorithm for Ren et al. without losing any accuracy. We apply FastGGM to two real data sets: transcriptomic data from a study of childhood asthma and proteomic data from a study of Alzheimer’s disease. We estimate the global gene or protein interaction networks for the disease and healthy samples. The resulting networks reveal interesting interactions and the differential networks between cases and controls show functional relevance to the diseases. FastGGM provides a computationally fast algorithm to implement a statistically sound procedure for constructing GGM and making inference with high-dimensional biological data.
Striatal medium spiny neurons ( MSNs ) form cell assemblies whose population firing rates vary coherently on slow behaviourally relevant timescales. We investigate how MSN network generated population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical driving activity, as would occur in a behavioural task. We find that at unrealistically high connectivity a stable winners-take-all type regime is found where network activity separates into fixed stimulus dependent regularly firing and quiescent components. In this regime only a small number of population firing rate components interact with cortical stimulus variations. Around connectivity a transition to a more dynamically active regime occurs where all cells constantly switch between activity and quiescence. In this low connectivity regime, MSN population components wander randomly and here too are independent of variations in cortical driving. Only in the transition regime do weak changes in cortical driving interact with many population components so that sequential cell assemblies are reproducibly activated for many hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset and peri-stimulus time histograms display strong stimulus and temporal specificity. We show that this activity is maximized at striatally realistic connectivities and IPSP sizes.
Polarized exocytosis and endocytosis are two transport pathways that work together to maintain polarized growth in cells. Polarized exocytosis transports membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, while endocytosis retrieves these components before they can diffuse away. We show that the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p couples polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization, which induces endocytosis. After polarized exocytosis to the plasma membrane, Sec4p binds Las17/Bee1p ( yeast Wiskott—Aldrich Syndrome protein [WASp] ) in a complex with Sla1p and Sla2p during actin patch assembly. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p, or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) Sec2p, inhibit actin patch formation, whereas the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays of Arp2/3-dependent actin polymerization established that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation. These results support a model in which Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis. Activated Sec4p then promotes actin polymerization and triggers compensatory endocytosis, which controls surface expansion and kinetically refines cell polarization.
Acetaminophen ( APAP ) -induced liver injury ( AILI ) in mice is a widely used model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. The prevailing mechanistic explanation for early perivenous necrosis assumes that zonation of NAPQI formation, the reactive metabolite of APAP, is a necessary and sufficient prerequisite to explain this phenomenon. However, this hypothesis remains unchallenged in mice because it is infeasible to control influential variables and obtain sequential intracellular measurements at different lobular locations within the same mouse. To challenge this hypothesis, we employed virtual hepatocytes that use independently configured periportal-to-central vein ( CV ) gradients to exhibit lobule-location dependent behaviors. We posited that at least one additional feature must exhibit zonation by decreasing in the CV direction in order to achieve the Target Phenomenon, which is that necrosis begins adjacent to the CV and progresses outward. We instantiated and explored two alternative features: a glutathione depletion threshold that diminishes in the CV direction, and the ability to repair mitochondrial damage that diminishes in the CV direction. However, inclusion of one or the other feature failed to achieve the Target Phenomenon, but inclusion of both features enabled successful achievement of the Target Phenomenon. The merged mechanism provides a multilevel, multiscale causal explanation of key temporal features of APAP hepatotoxicity in mice.
Congenitally infected children with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, can be difficult to diagnose immediately after birth. The current gold standard for diagnosis is the INP micromethod, which detects parasites in blood samples by microscopy. However, this method is not sensitive enough to detect low levels of parasitemia. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the INP micromethod and quantitative DNA amplification in congenitally infected children. We analyzed blood samples from 51 children born to T. cruzi-infected mothers at three different time points: 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after birth. We found that only infants with very high parasitemia levels could be diagnosed by parasitology screening at 1 month of age. Infants that required a second parasitological diagnosis at 6 months of age had lower parasitemia levels, and those diagnosed by serology at around 1 year of age had the lowest parasitemia levels of all. Our results show that the parasite burden in some children is below the detection limit of the INP micromethod. We also found that the current trypanocidal treatment is very effective in curing T. cruzi-infected children. Our study highlights the need for more sensitive parasitological methods to improve the early diagnosis of congenitally infected newborns and allow for prompt and effective treatment.
We propose a biophysical model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and effective cellular composition from an effective, coarse-grained representation of its genome. The model assumes that E. coli is in a state of balanced exponential steady-state growth, growing in a temporally and spatially constant environment, rich in resources. We apply this model to a series of past measurements, where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio have been measured for seven E. coli strains with an rRNA operon copy number ranging from one to seven. These experiments show that growth rate markedly decreases for strains with fewer than six copies. Using the model, we were able to reproduce these measurements. The model suggests that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied. Moreover, the model predicts that increasing the copy number beyond seven results in a cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins. The model also predicts that growth rate will not increase substantially beyond the wild-type growth rate when the rRNA operon copy number is increased beyond seven. These predictions are consistent with other experiments and suggest that changing the rRNA operon copy number of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate.
RSM1, an Arabidopsis MYB protein, plays a role in seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid ( ABA ) and salinity. We show that down-regulation or up-regulation of RSM1 expression alters the sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of RSM1 is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. The transcription factors ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 ( HY5 ) and HY5 HOMOLOG ( HYH ) regulate RSM1 expression via binding to the RSM1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal that RSM1 mediates multiple functions of HY5 in responses of seed germination, post-germination development to ABA and abiotic stresses, and seedling tolerance to salinity. RSM1 interacts with HY5/HYH in vitro and in vivo. RSM1 and HY5/HYH may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. RSM1 binds to the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE 5 ( ABI5 ), thereby regulating its expression, while RSM1 interaction also stimulates HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. RSM1 and HY5/HYH may converge on the ABI5 promoter and independently or dependently regulate ABI5 expression and ABI5-downstream ABA and abiotic stress-responsive genes.
Mitochondrial complex I is the largest and most complicated proton pump of the respiratory chain. It links the electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to the pumping of four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. Recent X-ray structural analysis of prokaryotic and eukaryotic complex I revealed that the redox reactions are confined to the hydrophilic peripheral arm of the L-shaped molecule and take place at a remarkable distance from the membrane domain. This implies that the proton pumping within the membrane arm of complex I is driven indirectly via long-range conformational coupling. However, the molecular mechanism and the number, identity, and localization of the pump-sites remain unclear. Here, we report that upon deletion of the gene for a small accessory subunit of the Yarrowia complex I, a stable subcomplex ( nb8mΔ ) is formed that lacks the distal part of the membrane domain. The analysis of the subunit composition of holo and subcomplex by three complementary proteomic approaches revealed that two of the three subunits with homology to bacterial Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters that have been discussed as prime candidates for harbouring the proton pumps were missing in nb8mΔ. Nevertheless, nb8mΔ still pumps protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. Our results provide evidence that the membrane arm of complex I harbours two functionally distinct pump modules that are connected in series by the long helical transmission element recently identified by X-ray structural analysis.
Malaria and dengue fever are two infectious diseases that induce fever, a regulated increase in body temperature resulting from both infectious and non-infectious causes. Fever is known to play a role in modulating immune responses to infection, but the potential of febrile temperatures in regulating antigen binding affinity to antibodies has not been explored. Here, we investigated this process under in vitro conditions using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry and ELISA. We used selected malarial and dengue antigens against specific monoclonal antibodies, and observed a marked increase in the affinity of these antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C, compared to physiological ( 37°C ) or pathophysiological temperatures ( 42°C ). Induced thermal equilibration of the protein partners at these temperatures in vitro, prior to measurements, further increased their binding affinity. These results suggest another positive and adaptive role for fever in vivo, and highlight the favourable role of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity for samples with limited availability.
Actomyosin-based cortical flow is a fundamental engine for cellular morphogenesis. Cortical flows are generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors, in which active stress produced by motor activity is opposed by passive resistance to network deformation. We study a computational model for a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress: Asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links and filament turnover. Our analysis predicts that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady state flow in response to external stress. Steady state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τm, then decreases with lifetime above τm. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time τc, and then becomes independent of filament lifetime and sharply dependent on crosslink dynamics. These individual dependencies of active stress and effective viscosity define multiple regimes of steady state flow. In particular, our model predicts that when filament lifetimes are shorter than both τc and τm, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady state stress on filament turnover cancel one another, such that flow speed is insensitive to filament turnover, and shows a simple dependence on motor activity and crosslink dynamics.
Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings are sensitive to high concentrations of glucose and fructose, which inhibit seedling growth and greening. A novel sugar-sensing quantitative trait locus ( QTL ), GSQ11, was identified in a Col X C24 F2 population using a selective genotyping approach. GSQ11 encodes the Arabidopsis NAC family transcription factor 060 ( ANAC060 ). The Col ANAC060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. A single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) in Col ANAC060 affects the splicing patterns of ANAC060, resulting in a truncated protein lacking the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) that is present in the C24 ANAC060 protein. The truncated ANAC060 protein is found in ∼12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. GSQ11/ANAC060 expression is induced by glucose in a process that requires abscisic acid ( ABA ) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient expression analysis showed that ABI4 directly binds to the GSQ11/ANAC060 promoter to activate transcription. Interestingly, Col ANAC060 reduced ABA sensitivity and Glc-induced ABA accumulation, and ABI4 expression was also reduced in Col ANAC060 lines. Thus, the sugar-ABA signaling cascade induces ANAC060 expression, but the truncated Col ANAC060 protein attenuates ABA induction and ABA signaling. This negative feedback from nuclear ANAC060 on ABA signaling results in sugar insensitivity.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation and motility are controlled by the HptB regulatory cascade, which is intersected by the diguanylate cyclase HsbD. HsbD synthesizes cyclic di-GMP ( c-di-GMP ), a nucleotide second messenger that regulates a variety of eubacterial behaviors. We show that the HptB pathway controls biofilm formation and motility by involving both HsbD and the anti-anti-sigma factor HsbA. The rewiring of c-di-GMP signaling into the HptB cascade relies on the original interaction between HsbD and HsbA and on the control of HsbD dynamic localization at the cell poles. The acquisition of hsbD in P. aeruginosa and the genetic reorganization that brought together hsbD, hptB/hsbA/hsbR and additional flagellar and chemotactic genes to form a novel entity involved in the control of motility and biofilm reveals an interesting scenario on the possible evolution of c-di-GMP signaling. We show that HsbD and SadC, another diguanylate cyclase, act at distinct positions in the c-di-GMP network that controls P. aeruginosa behavior.
Visuomotor learning refers to the ability of humans to learn and store multiple visuomotor mappings, i. e., the relationship between visual information and motor responses. However, little is known about the associative learning between cue and required visuomotor mapping, and how learning generalises to novel but similar conditions. To investigate these questions, participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while we manipulated the offset between visual feedback and movement end-points. The visual feedback was presented with horizontal offsets of different amounts, dependent on the target shape. Participants thus needed to use different visuomotor mappings between target location and required motor response depending on the target shape in order to “hit” it. The target shapes were taken from a continuous set of shapes, morphed between spiky and circular shapes. After training, we tested participants’ performance, without feedback, on different target shapes that had not been learned previously. The results show that, although learning the associations requires explicit awareness of the cues’ role, participants apply the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that is most similar to the current one, consistent with a Bayesian learning model. Furthermore, the Bayesian learning model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the present results.
Climbing fibers are one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum and are generally believed to be related to the timing of motor commands and/or motor learning. Climbing fiber spikes lead to large all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkinje cells, silencing these cells for a brief period of time afterwards. Empirical evidence shows that the climbing fiber can transmit a short burst of spikes as a result of an olivary cell somatic spike, potentially increasing the information being transferred to the cerebellum per climbing fiber activation. We used a detailed three-compartmental model of an inferior olivary cell to further investigate the possible factors determining the size of the climbing fiber burst. Our findings suggest that the phase-dependency of the burst size is present but limited and that charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the climbing fiber burst. We also found that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can have a big effect on the climbing fiber burst size through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells. Our model predicts that there may be a phase-dependency of climbing fiber burst size, but only in a limited range of sub-threshold oscillation ( STO ) amplitudes and in coupled cell ensembles of sufficient size.
Iron is an essential element for all known forms of life due to its redox properties; however, these same properties can also lead to toxicity through the production of reactive oxygen species. The liver plays a central role in maintaining safe levels of iron, and iron misregulation is implicated in many diseases. Despite recent advances in understanding the fate of iron in the body, a quantitative understanding of how its components interact to produce tight regulation remains elusive. Here, we present a mechanistic computational model of human liver iron metabolism that includes the core regulatory components. The model was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and their kinetic properties, and it was quantitatively validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data. The model was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings, including a time course simulation following an oral dose of iron that recreated the dynamics and time scale of the systems response to iron challenge. We also created a disease state simulation of haemochromatosis by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene ( HFE ) mutation. The simulation provides a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease. This model supports and supplements our understanding of the role of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve further our knowledge of this system.
Nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ) across the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) plays a critical role in regulating transcription and protecting the genetic material of eukaryotic cells. The NPC is the exclusive gateway of material transport across the nuclear envelope, and its structure is highly conserved from yeast to vertebrates. However, the transport mechanism of NCT remains elusive. The interaction between karyopherins ( kaps ) and Phe-Gly ( FG ) repeat domains is central to the transport process. We have established a coarse-grained model of the NPC structure that mimics NCT, taking into account the polymeric nature of FG-repeats grafted on the elastic structure of the NPC and the kap-FG hydrophobic affinity. The model predicts that the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex is about 2. 6±0. 13 ms with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The cargo-complex is primarily attached to the channel wall where it interacts with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. The kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient translocation through the NPC. The model also predicts that almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on kap-β are occupied simultaneously during transport.
Determining the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for nonhuman primate ( NHP ) models is a critical step in testing interventions designed to block infection by human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. In NHP models, it is desirable to use a limiting infectious dose as a challenge, which only infects a fraction of animals at each exposure. However, this requires careful titration of the infectious agent, as using a dose that is too high may lead to false negative results and using a dose that is too low may lead to insufficient infections within the time frame of the experiment. A 2-fold error in the challenge dose can significantly impact the power of an experiment. Here, we define a protocol for determining the dose of pathogen that infects 50% of the time ( AID50 ), which minimizes the number of animals and resources needed to define an infectious pathogen challenge dose in NHPs. On average, the protocol will enroll 15 animals, require 3 rounds, and result in an estimate of the AID50 within 40% of the true value. This protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and any animal model, but is most critical for NHP models where ethical considerations mandate minimization of animal use.
We report a new form of adaptation in a first-order auditory interneuron ( AN2 ) of crickets, characterized by a time constant of 1. 5 s for adaptation and recovery. The response of the AN2 neuron to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli shifts the stimulus–response curves toward higher stimulus intensities, resulting in reduced spike responses for low-intensity sounds. We tested how adaptation changes the input–response curve when presenting signals with two or three peaks in their amplitude distributions, for which selective coding and infomax predict conflicting changes. By means of Bayesian data analysis, we quantify the shifts of the measured response curves and find a slight reduction of their slopes. These decreases in slopes are smaller, and the absolute response thresholds are higher than those predicted by infomax. Most remarkably, adaptation actually reduces the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of input signals. The response curve changes are also not consistent with the selective coding hypothesis, because the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal does not increase as predicted but remains nearly constant. Less information is transmitted about signals with lower intensity.
Prions are infectious proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in cattle. Prions are composed of a misfolded form of the prion protein ( PrPSc ) that interacts with the normal form of the prion protein ( PrPC ). Previous studies have identified two polybasic domains in PrPC that bind PrPSc, suggesting that these domains serve as docking sites for PrPSc during prion propagation. In this study, we investigated the role of polybasic domains in the context of full-length PrPC. We used prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains expressed from Chinese hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( sPMCA ) reactions. We found that PrPSc molecules lacking the central polybasic domain ( ΔC ) were formed after ∼5 rounds of sPMCA. However, in contrast to wild-type prions, ΔC-PrPSc prions could bind to and induce quantitative conversion of all the polybasic domain mutant substrates into PrPSc molecules. Remarkably, ΔC-PrPSc and other polybasic domain PrPSc molecules displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild-type PrPSc. These results suggest that the propagation of PrPSc molecules may not depend on a single stereotypic mechanism, but that normal PrPC/PrPSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required to generate prion infectivity.
In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement learning ( IRL ) framework to identify an animal’s behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to C. elegans thermotactic behavior and found that fed worms use both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative to control their behavior. We identified two strategies used by fed worms: directed migration ( DM ) towards the cultivation temperature and isothermal migration ( IM ) along a constant temperature contour. In contrast, starved worms used only the absolute temperature to escape the cultivation temperature. We also found that the value function underlying the thermotactic behavior of fed worms represents the benefit of each state, namely, how much future rewards are expected starting from a given state. Our IRL approach is useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making in other organisms. We also investigated the neural basis underlying these strategies by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. Our results indicate that fed worms utilize sensory information of both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative for their behavioral strategy, while starved worms use only the absolute temperature.
Chrysochromulina tobin, a member of the haptophyte order Prymnesiales, is the second haptophyte for which the nuclear genome has been sequenced. The nuclear genome of C. tobin is small ( 59 Mb ), compact ( ∼40% of the genome is protein coding ) and encodes approximately 16, 777 genes. Genes important to fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression when monitored over the circadian photoperiod. The C. tobin genome harbors the first hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex reported for an algal species, and encodes potential anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. A new haptophyte xanthorhodopsin was also identified, together with two “red” RuBisCO activases that are shared across many algal lineages. The C. tobin genome provides new information on the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes.
Breast cancers that are triple-negative for the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 typically belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype and are associated with defective Rb, p53, and Brca1 pathways. Our mouse genetic studies demonstrate that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress the physiological cell death of mammary involution. Furthermore, concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. The tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features that are common among human Brca1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses demonstrate that the tumors share attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader, triple-negative class defined by clinical markers. Our results show that concomitant inactivation of all three tumor suppressor pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant, malignant carcinomas.
Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, the most important arboviral infection globally. Until an effective vaccine is licensed, Ae. aegypti control remains the principal tool in preventing and curtailing dengue transmission. Accurate predictions of Ae. aegypti populations are required to assess control methods and develop effective population reduction strategies. We expect that containers in an area of high development site density are more likely to be oviposition sites and to be more frequently used as oviposition sites than containers that are relatively isolated from other development sites. After accounting for individual container characteristics, containers more frequently used as oviposition sites are likely to produce adult mosquitoes consistently and at a higher rate. Pupal surveys were carried out from 2004 to 2007 in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand. In total, 84, 840 samples of water holding containers were used to estimate model parameters. Regression modeling was used to assess the effect of larval development site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity. The number of suitable larval development sites and their density in the environment were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Ae. aegypti pupae. The productivity of most container types increased significantly as habitat density increased. An ecological approach, accounting for development site density, is appropriate for predicting Ae. aegypti population levels and developing efficient vector control programs.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 ( TORC2 ) acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain, thereby contributing to modulation of neuronal function by internal state. We show that TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of the daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide ( ILP ) genes, which together reflect bacterial-diet dependent feeding status and provide a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in the regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. During development, pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate expression of daf-7 and daf-28 in sensory neurons to promote a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. In the adult, TORC2 similarly acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDFR-1 neuropeptide signaling-dependent pathway. We also demonstrate that genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and identify quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) associated with these traits.
Embryonic stem ( ES ) cells are of fundamental interest for their ability to self-renew and differentiate into various cell types. Understanding the transcriptional regulation of pluripotent cells will greatly inform efforts aimed at directing differentiation of ES cells or reprogramming somatic cells. Here, we report the systematic identification of cis-regulatory sequences active in mouse and human ES cells. We first analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse ES cells and primordial germ cells and identified genes upregulated in pluripotent cells both in vitro and in vivo. These genes are enriched for roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. We developed a novel computational algorithm, CompMoby, which combines analyses of sequences both aligned and non-aligned between different genomes with a probabilistic segmentation model to systematically predict short DNA motifs that regulate gene expression. CompMoby was used to identify conserved overrepresented motifs in genes upregulated in pluripotent cells. We show that the motifs are preferentially active in undifferentiated mouse ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner, and that they can act as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter. Importantly, the activity of the motifs is conserved in human ES cells. We further show that the transcription factor NF-Y specifically binds to one of the motifs, is differentially expressed during ES cell differentiation, and is required for ES cell proliferation.
Vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) is a non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus that requires a continuous supply of the nucleoprotein ( N ) in the form of a complex with the phosphoprotein ( P ) for replication. Here, we present the structural characterization of a soluble, heterodimeric complex between a variant of VSV N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues ( NΔ21 ) and a peptide of 60 amino acids ( P60 ) encompassing the molecular recognition element ( MoRE ) of P that binds RNA-free N ( N0 ). The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form and was solved at 3. 0 Å resolution, revealing how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and NMR spectroscopy on the soluble complex confirm the binding of the MoRE and indicate that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure of this complex also suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis.
In the fly visual system, the role of gap junctions ( GJs ) in the vertical system ( VS ) network, which plays a key role in visual processing, has been explored. Our information theoretical analysis of a realistic VS network model shows that within 10 ms following the onset of visual input, the presence of axonal GJs enables the VS system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly’s ego motion. This encoding efficiency, measured in bits, is near-optimal with respect to the physical limits of performance determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. We found that the VS 5-6-7 triplet, which is directly connected to downstream DNOVS1, 2 neurons, encodes motion more efficiently than the network as a whole, and reaches at least 90% of the physical limit of performance as determined by the statistical structure of the visual input itself. This near-optimal encoding efficiency emerged as robust regardless of the signal to noise ratios. We further demonstrate that this efficient encoding of motion by this subpopulation is necessary for the fly’s visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Because GJs are formed among the axons of the VS cells, they only impact the system’s readout, while maintaining the dendritic input intact, suggesting that the computational principles implemented by neural circuitries may be much richer than previously appreciated based on point neuron models.
Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) is one of the major causative agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children and has been associated with various neurological diseases including fatal cases in large EV71 outbreaks in the Asia Pacific region. Recently, PSGL-1 was identified as a cellular receptor for entry and replication of EV71 in leukocytes. PSGL-1 is a sialomucin expressed on the surface of leukocytes and serves as a high affinity counterreceptor for selectins. The PSGL-1–P-selectin interaction requires sulfation of at least one of three clustered tyrosines and an adjacent O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x in an N-terminal region of PSGL-1. To elucidate the molecular basis of the PSGL-1–EV71 interaction, we generated a series of PSGL-1 mutants and identified the post-translational modifications that are critical for binding of PSGL-1 to EV71. We expressed the PSGL-1 mutants in 293T cells and the transfected cells were assayed for their abilities to bind to EV71 by flow cytometry. We found that O-glycosylation on T57, which is critical for PSGL-1–selectin interaction, is not necessary for PSGL-1 binding to EV71. On the other hand, site-directed mutagenesis at one or more potential tyrosine sulfation sites in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 significantly impaired PSGL-1 binding to EV71. Furthermore, an inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked the PSGL-1–EV71 interaction and inhibited PSGL-1-mediated viral replication of EV71 in Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the results presented in this study reveal that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 may facilitate virus entry and replication of EV71 in leukocytes.
Leishmaniasis is a serious global health problem that affects millions of people worldwide. Current treatments are limited by drug toxicity and the emergence of resistant strains. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitors in controlling infection with Leishmania major. We tested three mTOR inhibitors, namely rapamycin, GSK-2126458 and KU-0063794, in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Our results show that treatment with a clinically relevant dose of rapamycin or GSK-2126458, but not KU-0063794, dramatically lowered both footpad swelling and parasite load in the draining lymph node. Importantly, the employed dose of rapamycin did not kill the promastigotes in vitro. We also found that treatment with rapamycin significantly reduced IL-4 production by splenocytes and elevated the IFN-γ:IL-4 production ratio, suggesting a T helper-type 1 ( Th1 ) -skewed cytokine profile. Furthermore, the expression level of CD69, an early activation marker, on splenic and lymph node CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was enhanced in rapamycin-treated mice. Our findings suggest that select mTOR inhibitors may be used in therapeutic settings for the management of leishmaniasis. We propose that the beneficial effects of such inhibitors stem from their immunomodulatory properties, and that the adjuvanticity of mTOR inhibitors may also be considered in vaccination strategies against Leishmania species.
Natural transformation is a biological process by which competent bacteria take up free DNA, incorporate it into their genomes, and become genetically altered. To prevent deleterious transformation by foreign DNA, some bacteria preferentially take up their own DNA that contains a specific DNA uptake sequence ( DUS ). In Neisseria species, we recently identified ComP as the DUS receptor. Here, we report a functional analysis of the interdependence between DUS and ComP during natural transformation. We show that ComP is essential for transformation in the presence and absence of DUS, and that the inner bases of DUS are critical for recognition by ComP and hence transformation. We also show that naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals, differing from DUS by only one or two bases, are similarly impaired for transformation of N. meningitidis. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a ComP homolog from the N. subflava commensal specifically binds its cognate DUS variant and mediates DUS-enhanced transformation when expressed in a comP mutant of N. meningitidis. These findings shed new light on the molecular events involved in the earliest step of natural transformation and reveal an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche.
Cytokinesis in fission yeast requires the coordinated closure of a contractile actomyosin ring ( CAR ) and the synthesis of a cell wall structure known as the division septum. Our study shows that cooperation between the paxillin homolog Pxl1 and the glucan synthase Bgs1 is required for stable anchorage of the CAR to the plasma membrane before septation onset and for cleavage furrow formation. Pxl1 is required for ring integrity, and Bgs1 is responsible for linear β ( 1, 3 ) glucan synthesis and primary septum formation. In cells lacking Pxl1, Bgs1 depletion causes failure of ring contraction and lateral cell wall overgrowth towards the cell lumen without septum formation. We also show that Pxl1 concentration at the CAR increases during cytokinesis and that this increase depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. The absence of Pxl1 is lethal when Cdc15 function is affected, generating a large sliding of the CAR with deposition of septum wall material along the cell cortex. Our findings indicate that CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane through Cdc15 and Pxl1, and concomitant Bgs1 activity, are necessary for CAR maintenance and septum formation in fission yeast.
Glanders is a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia mallei. Although eradicated from many Western countries, it has recently emerged in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. We investigated a recent outbreak of glanders in Bahrain by applying high resolution genotyping and comparative whole genome sequencing to B. mallei isolated from infected horses and a camel. The results were compared to samples obtained from an outbreak in the United Arab Emirates in 2004, and further placed into a broader phylogeographic context based on previously published B. mallei data. The samples from the outbreak in Bahrain separated into two distinct clusters, suggesting a complex epidemiological background and evidence for the involvement of multiple B. mallei strains. The samples from Bahrain were more closely related to B. mallei isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 than other B. mallei, suggesting repeated importation to the region from similar geographic sources. The close relationship of the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations to each other may be indicative of a similar geographic origin that has yet to be identified for the infecting strains. Our results provide evidence that the recent outbreak in Bahrain was caused by two different B. mallei strains, suggesting two independent introductions.
American cutaneous leishmaniasis ( ACL ) is a neglected tropical disease responsible for approximately 67, 000 new cases per year. In Colombia, the majority of ACL cases are caused by Leishmania ( Viannia ) ( L. V. ) subgenus parasites, which are more prone to treatment failure than those from the Leishmania ( Leishmania ) ( L. L. ) subgenus. Pentavalent antimonial derivatives, such as Glucantime or Sodium Stibogluconate, are recommended as first-line treatment for ACL caused by Leishmania braziliensis. However, the reasons for treatment failure are not well understood. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted to characterise the clinical and parasitological features of patients with ACL that did not respond to Glucantime treatment. The study included 43 patients recruited from three Colombian Army National reference centres for complicated ACL. The predominant infecting parasite species was L. braziliensis ( 95. 4% ), and 35% of the isolated parasites showed a significant decrease in in vitro Glucantime susceptibility associated with previous administration of the medicament. A negative correlation was found between lesion size and in vitro infectivity of the parasite ( Spearman: r = ( - ) 0, 548 and r = ( - ) 0, 726; respectively ). L. braziliensis was the main parasite species associated with treatment failure or relapse.
Siderophores and colibactin biosynthetic pathways in Escherichia coli are dependent on 4′-phosphopantetheinyl transferases ( PPTases ). Two PPTases, EntD and ClbA, have been identified, with EntD encoded in the core genome of E. coli and ClbA encoded on the pks pathogenicity island. The pks island is physically associated with the high pathogenicity island ( HPI ) in highly virulent E. coli strains. We investigated the potential interplay between siderophore and colibactin biosynthetic pathways through functional interchangeability between EntD and ClbA. We demonstrated that ClbA can contribute to siderophore synthesis and that inactivation of both entD and clbA abolished the virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli ( ExPEC ) in a mouse sepsis model. The presence of either functional EntD or ClbA was required for the survival of ExPEC in vivo. This is the first report demonstrating a connection between multiple phosphopantetheinyl-requiring pathways leading to the biosynthesis of functionally distinct secondary metabolites in a given microorganism. We hypothesize that the association of the pks island with HPI has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because ClbA is a promiscuous PPTase that can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores.
Phylogenetic tree inference is a fundamental task in sequence analysis that involves calculating the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree relating the sequences and an evolutionary model describing how sequences change over time. However, the most widely used phylogenetic models only account for residue substitution events and do not account for insertion and deletion events. We describe a probabilistic model of a multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by the gap character. We construct a non-reversible generative ( birth–death ) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions, assuming that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. We apply this model to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip. Using standard benchmarking methods on simulated data and a new “concordance test” benchmark on real ribosomal RNA alignments, we show that the extended program dnamlε improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm.
Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) initiates immunity in the human body by first infecting the mucosal epidermis and then entering nerve endings. In mice, epidermal Langerhans cells ( LCs ) are the first dendritic cells ( DCs ) to encounter HSV, but it is CD103+ dermal DCs that transport viral antigens to lymph nodes for antigen presentation. In this study, we compared HSV-1 infected human foreskin explants with biopsies of initial human genital herpes lesions to show that LCs are initially infected and then emigrate into the dermis. LCs bearing markers of maturation and apoptosis form large cell clusters with BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ DCs/macrophages. HSV-expressing LC fragments are observed inside the dermal DCs/macrophages and the BDCA3+ dermal DCs have up-regulated a damaged cell uptake receptor CLEC9A. Correspondingly, LCs isolated from human skin and infected with HSV-1 in vitro also undergo apoptosis and are taken up by similarly isolated BDCA3+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN+ cells. Thus, we conclude that a viral antigen relay takes place where HSV infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken up by dermal DCs for subsequent antigen presentation.
Parasitophorous vacuoles ( PVs ) are membrane-bound organelles that house intracellular microorganisms, such as Leishmania amastigotes, within host macrophages. In this study, we investigated the biogenesis and remodeling of Leishmania PVs in primary mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with either Leishmania major or L. amazonensis amastigotes. We used multidimensional imaging of live cells and the lysosomotropic fluorescent probe Lysotracker to compare and characterize PV biogenesis in macrophages hosting amastigotes of either L. major or L. amazonensis. We documented three dynamic features of Leishmania amastigote-hosting PVs: i ) entry of Lysotracker transients within tight-fitting, fission-prone L. major amastigote-housing PVs; ii ) the decrease in the number of macrophage acidic vesicles during the L. major PV fission or L. amazonensis PV enlargement; and iii ) the L. amazonensis PV remodeling after homotypic fusion. Our results show that L. major amastigotes are housed in tight-fitting PVs that undergo fission, while L. amazonensis amastigotes are housed in giant PVs that undergo homotypic fusion. We also found that approximately 50 acidic vesicles in macrophages infected with L. major or L. amazonensis are consumed in the course of intracellular infection, representing a hypothetical volume contribution of 30 µm3 to Leishmania PVs.
Chromatin structure plays a crucial role in regulating homologous recombination in vertebrate cells. Using the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model, we found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. We directly demonstrated the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion by tethering the heterochromatin protein HP1 to the pseudo-Vλ donor array using a regulatable experimental system. Tethered HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vλ array and altered the outcome of Vλ diversification, so that nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations predominated. These results suggest that chromatin structure regulates homologous-directed repair and that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.
Cerebellum-based motor learning is thought to be guided by the difference between the desired and the actual behavior, i. e., by error information. Climbing fibers, which connect with Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, are thought to transport information on instant errors needed for synaptic modification, but not to contribute to error memory. Here, we report work on monkeys tested in a saccadic learning paradigm that challenges this concept. We demonstrate not only a clear complex spikes ( CS ) signature of the error at the time of its occurrence, but also a reverberation of this signature much later, before a new manifestation of the behavior, suitable to improve it. This finding contrasts with the assumption that climbing fibers are confined to communicating instant errors. Our previous work on short-term saccadic adaptation observed patterns of CS that were at odds with this assumption. We therefore resorted to a random error saccadic adaptation paradigm, which avoids the gradual buildup of strong behavioral changes and the accompanying diminution of the error, potentially obscuring the electrophysiological fingerprint of the original error. We found statistically clear changes in the CS discharge rate, in particular the changes we found as a reflection of past errors in the CS discharge before the upcoming saccade.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of motor neurons with inclusions frequently containing the RNA/DNA binding protein TDP-43. Using a yeast model of ALS, we show that TDP-43 overexpression dramatically alters cell shape and reduces ubiquitin dependent proteolysis of a reporter construct. Furthermore, we show that an excess of the Hsp40 chaperone, Sis1, reduces TDP-43’s effect on toxicity, cell shape and proteolysis. The strength of these effects is influenced by the presence of the endogenous yeast prion, [PIN+]. We also show that overexpression of the mammalian Sis1 homologue, DNAJB1, relieves TDP-43 mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons, suggesting that Sis1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS. TDP-43 aggregation is frequently associated with ALS and other neurological diseases, and overexpressed human TDP-43 is toxic and forms cytoplasmic aggregates in yeast and mammalian neurons. Our finding that TDP-43 aggregates inhibit clearance of a misfolded reporter protein by the ubiquitin proteasome system is consistent with the hypothesis that some of the TDP-43 associated toxicity is caused by proteolytic dysfunction.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, is a major public health issue in many Latin American countries. In this study, we investigated the parasite load and molecular diversity of T. cruzi in patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. We used a multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real time PCR ( qPCR ) approaches to perform the molecular typing and parasite load quantification directly from blood specimens of 65 chronic Chagas disease patients. Of the 65 patients, 35 ( 53. 8% ) presented positive amplification by real time qPCR, being 20 ( 30. 7% ) with the clinical indeterminate form and 15 ( 23. 1% ) with the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load median for all positive patients was 2. 54 [1. 43–11. 14] parasite equivalents/mL ( par. Eq. /mL ), with the load ranging from 0. 12 to 153. 66 par. Eq. /mL. Notably, the parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old ( median 20. 05 [18. 29–86. 86] par. Eq. /mL ). We were able to genotype the parasite up to 0. 5 par. Eq. /mL, with high specificity, and identified T. cruzi discrete typing units ( DTUs ) in 28 patients ( 80% ). The most prevalent DTUs were TcVI ( 40% ), TcII ( 17. 1% ), and mixed infection TcVI+TcII ( 14. 3% ).
Rabies virus ( RABV ) is considered enzootic in the New World, but few data are available for most countries in the region. As part of a larger pathogen detection program, enhanced bat rabies surveillance was conducted in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011. A total of 672 bats of 31 species were sampled and tested for RABV. The overall prevalence of RABV detection among all collected bats was low ( 0. 3% ). However, two common vampire bats ( Desmodus rotundus ) were found to be infected with RABV. Viral antigens were detected and infectious virus was isolated from the brains, oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats. Additionally, viral RNA was detected in all tissues examined by hemi-nested RT-PCR, except for the liver of one bat. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the two vampire bat RABV isolates were related to viruses associated with vampire bats in the eastern states of Mexico and El Salvador. Furthermore, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation.
Herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) DNA initiates replication near the inner edge of the nucleus, and histones are excluded from these structures. The role of the nuclear lamina in HSV replication was examined in wild-type and A-type lamin–deficient ( Lmna−/− ) murine embryonic fibroblasts ( MEFs ). In Lmna−/− cells, viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target to the nuclear periphery. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that HSV DNA is associated with increased heterochromatin in Lmna−/− MEFs. These results argue for a functional role for A-type lamins as viral gene expression, DNA replication, and growth are reduced in Lmna−/− MEFs, with the greatest effect on viral replication at low multiplicity of infection. Thus, lamin A/C is required for targeting of the viral genome and the reduction of heterochromatin on viral promoters during lytic infection. The nuclear lamina can serve as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications.
Mitochondria originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts and their transition to organelles was tightly linked to the establishment of protein import pathways. The translocase of the outer membrane ( TOM ) is common to all forms of mitochondria, but an unexpected diversity of subunits between eukaryotic lineages has been predicted. Here, we characterise the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically specialised anaerobic form of mitochondria found in the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis. We demonstrate that the highly divergent β-barrel T. vaginalis TOM ( TvTom ) 40-2 forms a translocation channel to conduct hydrogenosomal protein import. TvTom40-2 is present in high molecular weight complexes, and their analysis revealed the presence of four tail-anchored ( TA ) proteins. Two of them, Tom36 and Tom46, with heat shock protein ( Hsp ) 20 and tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) domains, can bind hydrogenosomal preproteins and most likely function as receptors. A third subunit, Tom22-like protein, has a short cis domain and a conserved Tom22 transmembrane segment but lacks a trans domain. The fourth protein, hydrogenosomal outer membrane protein 19 ( Homp19 ), has no known homology. Our results suggest that the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of three conserved subunits, was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor ( LECA ), while receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages.
Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases are often associated with inappropriate activation or inadequate regulation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To better understand the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes, we conducted a comparative eQTL analysis of CD4+ versus CD8+ T cells. We identified cell type-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with several autoimmune diseases, including a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13. 2 containing the rs1131017 SNP in the RPS26 gene. We also identified a common missense variant in IL27, associated with type 1 diabetes, that results in decreased functional activity of the protein and reduced expression levels of downstream IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells only. Our results indicate that eQTL mapping in purified T cells provides novel functional insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we show that the rs181206[G] variant of the IL27 gene confers protection against T1D through the inhibited expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. Our results also suggest that IL-27 may promote autoimmunity toward pancreatic islets via the upregulation of the STAT1 pathway.
Sleeping sickness, also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis ( HAT ), is a major public health problem in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ). Despite efforts to control the disease, many people in the DRC do not participate in screening campaigns or adhere to treatment regimens. A qualitative study was conducted in the provinces of Bandundu and Kasaï Oriental, where HAT prevalence is high, to explore the reasons for this lack of participation. The study included interviews and focus group discussions with current and former HAT patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the national HAT control program. The results show that community members and healthcare providers believe that certain prohibitions must be respected for six months after HAT treatment, including no work, no sexual intercourse, no hot food, and no walking in the sun. These prohibitions are believed to prevent serious and sometimes deadly complications, but they are not evidence-based and were originally intended to mitigate the adverse effects of the melarsoprol treatment regimen, which is no longer recommended by the World Health Organization ( WHO ). The study highlights the need for an improved understanding of these prohibitions and their impact on HAT control efforts in the DRC.
Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) represents a significant health burden in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan. Between May 5th and June 17th, 2011, an exhaustive door-to-door survey was conducted in 45 villages of Al-Gureisha locality to estimate the VL incidence. The survey covered 94, 369 inhabitants in 17, 702 households. The crude mortality rate over the mean recall period of 409 days was 0. 13/10, 000 people per day. VL was a possible or probable cause for 19% of all deaths. The VL-specific mortality rate was estimated at 0. 9/1000 per year. The overall incidence of VL over the past year was 7. 0/1000 persons per year, or 7. 9/1000 per year when deaths possibly or probably due to VL were included. Overall, 12. 5% ( 11, 943/95, 609 ) of the population reported a past VL treatment episode. Active VL case detection had a very low yield in this specific setting with adequate access to care and may not be the priority intervention to enhance control in similar contexts.
Negative supercoiling in bacterial DNA is generated by the gyrase enzyme, which is composed of GyrA and GyrB proteins. The average supercoil density of large bacterial chromosomes and small plasmid DNA is influenced by mutations in gyrase and two other topoisomerases. The supercoil density of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms: diffusible supercoil density ( σD ) and constrained supercoil density ( σC ). Diffusible and constrained supercoils contribute roughly equally to the total in vivo negative supercoil density of wild-type cells. Unexpectedly, Escherichia coli chromosomes have a 15% higher level of σ compared to Salmonella enterica. We analyzed strains of Salmonella using a 9 kb “supercoil sensor” inserted at ten positions around the genome. The sensor contains a complete Lac operon flanked by directly repeated resolvase binding sites, and the sensor can monitor both supercoil density and transcription elongation rates in wild-type and mutant strains. We found that RNA transcription causes ( − ) supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess upstream supercoiling was relaxed by Topo I, and gyrase replenished downstream supercoil losses to maintain an equilibrium state. Strains with TS gyrase mutations growing at permissive temperature exhibited significant supercoil losses varying from 30% of wild-type levels to a total loss of σD at most chromosome locations.
Leishmania amazonensis is an intracellular protozoan parasite that replicates in parasitophorous vacuoles ( PVs ) that share features with late endosomes/lysosomes. We show that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate transcription of LYST/Beige, a gene previously implicated in regulating lysosome size. LYST/Beige functions as a host innate response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival. Mutations in LYST/Beige caused further PV expansion and enhanced L. amazonensis replication. In contrast, LYST/Beige overexpression led to small PVs that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of LYST/Beige over-expressing cells with vacuolin-1 reversed this phenotype, expanding PVs and promoting parasite growth. Enlarged PVs appear to protect parasites from oxidative damage, since inhibition of nitric oxide synthase had no effect on L. amazonensis viability within large PVs, but enhanced their growth within LYST/Beige-induced small PVs. Collectively, our findings provide direct experimental evidence for the idea that increased expression of LYST/Beige functions as a host innate response to restrict Leishmania growth by counteracting PV expansion.
Psychomotor retardation, characterized by motor and cognitive impairment, is a complex and poorly understood disorder. The Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome ( AHDS ) is an X-linked form of psychomotor retardation associated with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 ( mct8/slc16a2 ) gene, a thyroid hormone ( TH ) transporter. Previous studies using MCT8 knockout mice failed to replicate the neurological and behavioral symptoms of AHDS patients. Here, we generated an mct8 mutant ( mct8−/− ) zebrafish model using zinc-finger nuclease ( ZFN ) -mediated targeted gene editing. Similar to AHDS patients, mct8−/− larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to external light and dark transitions, and increased sleep time. These deficiencies were associated with altered expression of myelin-related genes and neuron-specific deficiencies in circuit formation. Time-lapse imaging of single-axon arbors and synapses in live mct8−/− larvae revealed a reduction in filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. Importantly, administration of TH analogs that can enter the cells in the absence of MCT8 restored the myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in mct8−/− larvae. These findings suggest a mechanism by which MCT8 regulates neural circuit assembly, ultimately mediating sensory and motor control of behavioral performance.
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a major pathogen in newborns and immunocompromised or immunosuppressed patients. Here, we demonstrate that HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early after their synthesis and in the absence of other viral proteins. This complex includes as much as 16–50% of the total gH/gL in HCMV virus particles. In contrast, only small amounts of gH/gL/gO and gH/gL/UL128-131 complexes were found associated with gB. These results have major implications for models describing herpesvirus entry, which suggest that gH/gL interacts with gB to mediate membrane fusion. Our results demonstrate that HCMV gB and gH/gL form stable gB-gH/gL complexes that are incorporated into virions without receptor binding or membrane fusion. Moreover, our data is the best support to date for the proposal that gH/gL interacts with gB. We also found that HCMV gB-gH/gL complexes are present in extracellular virions, suggesting that these complexes form before gB is activated for fusion and entry.
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) sequence variants are known to segregate in a mutation and tissue-specific manner, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, is a critical regulator of mtDNA segregation in leukocytes. Using a heteroplasmic mouse model, we show that Gimap3 genetically regulates the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues. We also demonstrate that segregation of mtDNA haplotypes in mouse hematopoietic tissues is a complex genetic trait regulated with age but independent of mtDNA copy number. Gimap3 is important for T cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and in modulating human mitochondrial diseases.
Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a skin and soft-tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, a toxin-producing environmental pathogen. In Victoria, Australia, we estimated the incubation period ( IP ) of BU to be between 4 and 5 months. This estimate is based on a retrospective review of 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria between 2013 and 2016, as well as data from an earlier study incorporating cases from 2002 to 2012. We found that the mean incubation period was 143 days ( 4. 8 months ) among 20 new cases identified in short-term visitors to endemic regions, which is very similar to the previous estimate of 135 days ( 4. 5 months ). We found no association between incubation period and age, sex, location of exposure, duration of exposure to an endemic region, or location of BU lesion. Our study confirms the mean incubation period of BU in Victoria to be between 4 and 5 months. This knowledge can guide clinicians and suggests that the mode of transmission of BU is similar in different geographic regions in Victoria.
Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite, contains a protein with a sterol-sensing domain ( SSD ) that is a close relative of the human Niemann-Pick, type C1-related protein ( NPC1 ). This protein, named TgNCR1, is predicted to play a role in lipid homeostasis in the parasite. TgNCR1 lacks endosomal targeting signals and localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane of Toxoplasma. When expressed in mammalian NPC1 mutant cells and targeted to endo-lysosomes, TgNCR1 restores cholesterol and GM1 clearance from these organelles. This suggests that TgNCR1 functions in a similar way as human NPC1 to promote the movement of sterols and sphingolipids across the membranes of endo-lysosomes. To investigate the role of TgNCR1 in Toxoplasma, we generated a parasite cell line lacking NPC1 that is viable. The mutant parasites exhibit perturbations in their lipid content, including an overaccumulation of several species of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. These mutants are also characterized by abundant storage lipid bodies and long membranous tubules derived from their parasitophorous vacuoles. Interestingly, these mutants can generate multiple daughters per single mother cell at high frequencies, allowing fast replication in vitro, and are slightly more virulent in mice than the parental strain.
Ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome ( OAS ), also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the combination of eye malformations, most commonly bilateral anophthalmia, with post-axial oligosyndactyly. Mutations in the SMOC1 gene have been identified as the major cause of OAS in eight unrelated families. The SMOC1 gene encodes a protein that functions as a Bone Morphogenic Protein ( BMP ) antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development provides a plausible explanation for both the limb and eye phenotype in humans and mice. A targeted pre-conditional gene-trap mutation of the orthologous mouse gene, Smoc1, results in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligosyndactyly in homozygous mutant animals. Eye malformations, most commonly coloboma, and cleft palate occur in a significant proportion of Smoc1tm1a/tm1a embryos and pups. The mouse phenotype shows significant overlap with the human disease. The SMOC1 gene is one of the two mammalian paralogs of Drosophila Pentagone, an inhibitor of decapentaplegic. The orthologous gene in Xenopus laevis, Smoc-1, also functions as a BMP antagonist in early embryogenesis.
TRIM22 is a key mediator of the antiviral activity of Type 1 interferons against HIV replication. We identified TRIM22 as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes in human cells treated with Type 1 interferons using transcriptional profiling. Over-expression of TRIM22 has previously been shown to inhibit HIV replication, but it was uncertain whether TRIM22 expressed at physiological levels would have antiviral activity. We used RNA interference to deplete TRIM22 in cells treated with Type 1 interferons and found that HIV particle release was significantly increased in the absence of TRIM22. This suggests that TRIM22 acts as a natural antiviral effector. Further studies showed that TRIM22 specifically inhibits the release of HIV Gag-only particles, but not particles of other retroviruses such as MLV or EIAV. We also found that TRIM22 disrupts the trafficking of HIV Gag, causing it to accumulate in the cytoplasm rather than at the plasma membrane. Mutational analyses showed that the catalytic amino acids Cys15 and Cys18 of the RING domain of TRIM22 are required for its antiviral activity.
Fig trees ( Ficus ) and their host-specific pollinator wasps ( Agaonidae ) form a classic example of an obligate mutualism, where both species benefit from each other. However, explaining the maintenance of this mutualism is problematic, as cheaters should outcompete cooperative conspecifics, leading to mutualism instability. In monoecious figs, pollinating wasps oviposit directly into ovules from inside the receptive syconium, but there is a segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid or are prevented from ovipositing into outer ovules, resulting in mutualism stability. However, the mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. We report that in Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. This results in a gradient of offspring viability towards the centre of the syconium, where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. We suggest that this gradient in offspring viability contributes to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, reducing their galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may contribute to mutualism persistence independent of additional factors that invoke plant defences against pollinator oviposition, or physiological constraints on pollinators that prevent oviposition in all available ovules.
Plant height is a dynamic trait in the model C4 grass Setaria that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. We have performed six controlled growth trials of an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to investigate the genetic architecture of plant height. The results show that plant height is reduced under water limitation and high density planting and is affected by growth environment. We find that plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait and that the major genetic loci that influence plant height function independently of growth environment. The identity and contribution of loci that influence height change dynamically throughout development and the reduction of growth observed in water limited environments is a consequence of delayed progression through the genetic program that establishes plant height in Setaria. In this population, alleles inherited from the weedy S. viridis parent act to increase plant height early, whereas a larger number of small effect alleles inherited from the domesticated S. italica parent collectively act to increase plant height later in development. We identify thirty seven QTL associated with plant height throughout development within a Setaria recombinant inbred population across twelve different experiments varying water availability and planting density.
Arboviruses, such as flaviviruses, circulate in the Pantanal region of West-Central Brazil due to the presence of diverse wildlife species and hematophagous arthropods. In the Nhecolândia sub-region of Pantanal, serological evidence of various flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Ilheus virus ( ILHV ), has been reported in horses. To confirm the circulation of these viruses, we collected 3, 234 adult mosquitoes of 16 species during 2009 and 2010 and tested them for infectious virus and flaviviral RNA. One pool of 50 non-engorged female Aedes scapularis mosquitoes tested positive for ILHV by culture and for ILHV RNA by real-time RT-PCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2. 5 per 1, 000. The full-length genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to the only full genome sequence available for ILHV. This study confirms the circulation of ILHV in the Brazilian Pantanal. The previously reported high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies for ILHV in horses combined with our isolation of ILHV in local mosquitoes confirm the activity of an arbovirus of potential medical importance in the region.
Moxidectin ( MOX ), a new oral treatment for scabies, was compared to ivermectin ( IVM ) in a preclinical study using a porcine scabies model. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive a single oral dose of MOX ( 0. 3 mg/kg ), two oral doses of IVM ( 0. 2 mg/kg each ), or no treatment. We evaluated treatment efficacies by assessing mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies. At day 14 post-treatment, all four MOX-treated but only two IVM-treated pigs were mite-free. MOX efficacy was 100% and remained unchanged until day 47, compared to 62% ( range 26–100% ) for IVM, with one IVM-treated pig remaining infected until day 47. Clinical scabies lesions, pruritus, and anti-S. scabiei IgG antibodies had completely disappeared in all MOX-treated but only 75% of IVM-treated pigs. MOX persisted ~9 times longer than IVM in plasma and skin, thereby covering the mite’s entire life cycle and enabling long-lasting efficacy. Our data demonstrate that oral single-dose MOX was more effective than two consecutive IVM-doses, supporting MOX as a potential therapeutic approach for scabies.
Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive pathogen known for its resistance to many antibiotics and prevalence in hospitals. Its genome encodes a low number of proteins with peptidoglycan ( PG ) synthesis activity, making it a good model for the study of a minimal PG synthesis machine. We deleted seven of the nine genes encoding PG synthesis enzymes from the S. aureus genome without affecting normal growth or cell morphology, generating a strain capable of PG biosynthesis catalyzed only by two penicillin-binding proteins, PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. We show that S. aureus cells are capable of PG synthesis catalyzed solely by the transpeptidase PBP1 and the bi-functional PBP2. Our results demonstrate the plasticity of the PG synthesis process in S. aureus. Apparently, S. aureus can synthesize its PG by using just two synthesis proteins, PBP1 and PBP2, which perform both transpeptidation and transglycosylation reactions. However, multiple PBPs are important in clinically relevant environments, as bacteria with a minimal PG synthesis machinery became highly susceptible to cell wall-targeting antibiotics, host lytic enzymes and displayed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model. The fact that S. aureus can grow and divide with only two active PG synthesizing enzymes shows that most of these enzymes are redundant in vitro and identifies the minimal PG synthesis machinery of S. aureus.
Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which is mostly saprophytic but can infect humans and cause a difficult-to-manage disease with mortality rates ranging from 20% in Northern Australia to over 40% in Thailand. Little is known about how B. pseudomallei infects, invades and survives within its hosts, and virtually nothing is known about the contribution of critical nutrients such as iron to the bacterium's pathogenesis. It was previously assumed that B. pseudomallei used iron-acquisition systems commonly found in other bacteria. However, our previous discovery of a clinical isolate carrying a large chromosomal deletion missing the entire malleobactin gene cluster encoding the bacterium's major high-affinity siderophore while still being fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model suggested that other iron-acquisition systems might make contributions to virulence. We deleted the major siderophore malleobactin ( mba ) and pyochelin ( pch ) gene clusters in strain 1710b and revealed a residual siderophore activity which was unrelated to other known Burkholderia siderophores. Deletion of the two hemin uptake loci, hmu and hem, showed that Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin and that Hem cannot complement a Hmu deficiency. A mba pch hmu hem quadruple mutant could use ferritin as an iron source and upon intranasal infection was lethal in an acute murine melioidosis model. These data suggest that B. pseudomallei may employ a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway as a means to sustain in vivo growth.
Genome-scale, constraint-based metabolic models ( GSMs ) are integrated knowledge repositories and predictive mathematical models of cellular function. However, their usability is often hampered by inconsistencies at various levels. To address this, we present COMMGEN, a tool for COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration that reconciles two or more distinct GSMs of the same organism beyond a common namespace. COMMGEN automatically identifies similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of the metabolic networks based on an extensive classification of problems that typically arise during GSM integration and on novel algorithms to resolve these problem classes. The tool forms a necessary bridge between full automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus metabolic model generation. Our tests of COMMGEN for four organisms showed that automatically generated consensus models were predictive and that they substantially increased coherence of knowledge representation. We demonstrated that automatically generated consensus models almost always have higher predictive power than the manually curated GSMs and that these models can be comparable to manually constructed consensus models. COMMGEN increases coherence with the actual biological system while maintaining predictive power. This balance is of utmost importance for the usability and reliability of GSMs to elucidate cell function interactions.
Chondrocytes embedded in a proteoglycan ( PG ) -rich matrix undergo a developmental transition, termed “maturation, ” when they express Indian hedgehog ( ihh ) to induce bone in the overlying tissue, the perichondrium. Here, we show that cartilage matrix controls the timing of endochondral ossification by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation. In a mutagenesis screen, we isolated zebrafish mutants with decreased cartilage matrix and increased perichondral bone. Positional cloning identified lesions in two genes, fam20b and xylosyltransferase1 ( xylt1 ), both of which encode PG synthesis enzymes. Mutants failed to produce wild-type levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs and initiated perichondral bone formation earlier than their wild-type siblings. Primary chondrocyte defects might induce the bone phenotype secondarily, because mutant chondrocytes precociously initiated maturation, showing increased and early expression of such markers as runx2b, collagen type 10a1, and ihh co-orthologs, and ihha mutation suppressed early perichondral bone in PG mutants. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated aberrant matrix organization and also early cellular features of chondrocyte hypertrophy in mutants. Our data argue that defective cartilage PG synthesis alters expression of transcription factors that determine the rates of chondrocyte maturation, thus changing the timing of perichondral bone formation.
Topoisomerase II ( Top2 ) is required for the proper separation of heterochromatic regions during Drosophila melanogaster female meiosis. We show that knockdown of Top2 by RNAi in the later stages of meiosis results in a specific defect in the separation of heterochromatic regions after spindle assembly. In Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, heterochromatic regions of both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes often failed to separate during prometaphase I and metaphase I. Heterochromatic regions were stretched into long, abnormal projections with centromeres localizing near the tips of the projections in some oocytes. Despite these anomalies, we observed bipolar spindles in most Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, although the obligately achiasmate 4th chromosomes exhibited a near complete failure to move toward the spindle poles during prometaphase I. Both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes displayed defects in biorientation. Embryos from Top2 RNAi-expressing females frequently failed to initiate mitotic divisions. These data suggest that Topoisomerase II is involved in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I and that these entanglements must be resolved in order to complete meiosis.
Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a zoonotic disease of great public health importance. Current control measures for canine visceral leishmaniasis ( CVL ) have limitations, indicating the need for new strategies. This study evaluated the effectiveness of mass use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in dogs as a public health measure to control and prevent CVL in a highly endemic area in Brazil. An interventional study was conducted in two areas: an intervention area where VL seronegative dogs were collared, and a control area where only conventional CVL control measures were applied. Dogs were reevaluated every 7–8 months for almost two years. In the intervention area, dogs that remained seronegative received new collars and newly identified seronegative dogs were included and collared. Dogs that tested seropositive were marked for euthanasia as mandated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health. At the second evaluation, significant reductions in seroprevalence were seen in both areas, while seroprevalence in the intervention area reduced to 6. 0% during the final evaluation versus an increase of 11. 0% in the control area. The estimated relative risk ( RR = 0. 55 ) indicated protection against CVL in the intervention area. Although CVL incidence did not differ significantly between the areas, an increased tendency was observed in the control area.
Sexual antagonism and the avoidance of activity in the male germline have been proposed as causes of the nonrandom gene content on the mammalian X chromosome. However, we suggest that limits imposed on gene expression owing to haploid expression of the X chromosome may more profoundly shape gene content. We test this hypothesis using data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome ( FANTOM5 ) project. We find that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is much lower than that of genes on autosomes. On average, maximal expression is three times lower on the X chromosome than on autosomes. We also find that autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X than seen for X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. Furthermore, X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression than autosomal ones if highly expressed, but not if lowly expressed. These trends cannot be fully accounted for in terms of alternative models of biased expression. We conclude that the notion that it is hard for genes on the Therian X to be highly expressed, owing to transcriptional traffic jams, provides a simple yet robustly supported rationale for many peculiar features of X’s gene content, gene expression, and evolution.
Helicobacter pylori is a gastric pathogen that originated in Africa and has been associated with humans for at least 100, 000 years. We investigated the prevalence and population structure of H. pylori among the Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of the Western Pygmies from Cameroon. We found that the Baka Pygmies had a significantly lower H. pylori infection rate ( 20. 8% ) than their neighboring agriculturalist populations ( 80. 2% ). We generated multilocus haplotypes for each H. pylori isolate and found that most were assigned to the hpNEAfrica or hpAfrica1 populations, which are associated with the expansion of the Nilo-Saharan language family and the Bantu languages, respectively. We also identified a new hpAfrica1 subpopulation mainly among Cameroonians. Using an age-structured transmission model, we show that the low H. pylori prevalence among Baka Pygmies is achievable within a few hundred years and suggest that demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy can lead to the eradication of H. pylori from individual human populations. Our results suggest that the Baka Pygmies were either H. pylori-free or lost their ancient lineages during past demographic fluctuations. Using coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference, we show that the Baka Pygmies almost certainly acquired their extant H. pylori through secondary contact with their agriculturalist neighbors.
Dengue virus NS5 is the most conserved non-structural protein amongst the flaviviruses and is responsible for capping, methylation, and replication of the viral RNA genome. The C-terminal 18 amino acid region ( Cter18 ) of NS5 is essential for its subcellular localization and contains a conserved arginine residue ( R888 ) that is critical for infectious virus production. The Cter18 is sufficient to direct the protein to either the cytoplasm or nucleus, depending on the serotype of the virus. The Cter18 of DENV2 NS5 binds to the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha ( Impα ) with low micromolar affinity, and structure-guided mutational analysis reveals that the trans conformation of Pro-884 is essential for this interaction. Mutating Pro-884 to threonine ( P884T ) results in mislocalization of NS5 to the cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. In contrast, mutating R888 to alanine ( R888A ) results in a completely non-viable virus, while mutating it to lysine ( R888K ) leads to a severely attenuated phenotype. The Cter18 of DENV2 and 3 NS5s may directly interact with cellular importins to target the protein to the nucleus, while the Cter18 of DENV1 NS5 may have evolved to bind to other host factors and is mostly located in the cytoplasm.
A novel integrated mapping protocol for neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ), the Integrated Threshold Mapping ( ITM ) Methodology, has been developed and field-tested for lymphatic filariasis ( LF ), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ). The protocol is designed to determine whether a threshold has been reached to trigger public health interventions in an implementation unit. It relies on World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommended indicators for each disease in specific age groups. We tested the protocol by comparing it to current WHO mapping methodologies for each disease in one district each in Mali and Senegal. The results show that the ITM methodology reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies regarding the initiation of public health interventions for trachoma, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. The ITM methodology was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-saving compared to the standard WHO methodologies. This integrated mapping tool could facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries.
Cdc14 is a conserved phosphatase required for the exit from mitosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by the Cfi1/Net1 protein until early anaphase, at which time it is released into the nucleoplasm. Cdc14 release is mediated by two redundant pathways, the FEAR ( Cdc fourteen early release ) network and the MEN ( mitotic exit network ). Here, we report a novel requirement for the ubiquitination of histone H2B by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase in the cell cycle–dependent release of Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin when the MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by the activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 ( meH3K4 and meH3K79 ) and is not dependent on the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) Sir2. We also observed a defect in Cdc14 release in cells lacking H3 lysine 36 methylation ( meH3K36 ) and in cells lacking an HDAC recruited by this modification. These histone modifications represent previously unappreciated factors required for the accessibility to and/or action on nucleolar chromatin of FEAR network components.
GeneProgram is a new unsupervised computational framework that addresses several challenges in the discovery of expression programs from human expression data compendia. These challenges include cellular inhomogeneity within samples, genetic and environmental variation across samples, uncertainty in the numbers of programs and sample populations, and temporal behavior. GeneProgram is based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes and simultaneously organizes tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior. It produces maps of expression programs, which are sorted by generality scores that exploit the automatically learned groupings. Using synthetic and real gene expression data, we showed that GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. We applied GeneProgram to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. GeneProgram produced a map of 104 expression programs, a substantial number of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors in genome-wide experiments. Further, GeneProgram discovered expression programs that appear to implicate surprising signaling pathways or receptor types in the response to infection, including Wnt signaling and neurotransmitter receptors.
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) drives epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus in NKG2Chi natural killer ( NK ) cells. NK cells play a crucial role in the defense against HCMV and represent the main source of interferon ( IFN ) -γ. In HCMV seropositive individuals, only NKG2Chi NK cells undergo epigenetic remodeling of the IFNG conserved non-coding sequence ( CNS ) 1, similar to memory CD8+ T cells or TH1 cells. This epigenetic imprinting is required to enhance IFN-γ transcriptional activity in response to NKG2C and 2B4 engagement, leading to consistent IFN-γ production in NKG2Chi NK cells. Our data identify epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus as a hallmark and crucial mechanism driving strong and stable IFN-γ expression in HCMV-specific NK cell expansions, providing a molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells.
Legionella pneumophila exploits the host proteasome system to temporally regulate the function of a cognate effector protein. The effector protein LubX functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that hijacks the host proteasome to specifically target the bacterial effector protein SidH for degradation. This results in the shutdown of SidH within the host cells at later stages of infection. We propose the designation “metaeffector” for this class of bacterial effectors that regulate the function of another effector within the host cell. This is the first example of a bacterial effector that targets and regulates a cognate effector within the host cells. Importantly, the determinants of the susceptibility of SidH to degradation are encoded in the effector protein itself, and LubX controls SidH instability in the host cytosol by directly targeting this protein for host ubiquitination. This represents a novel mechanism by which bacterial effectors are regulated and illustrates a sophisticated level of coevolution between eukaryotic cells and L. pneumophila involving an effector that functions as a key regulator to temporally coordinate the function of a cognate effector protein.
HIV-1 env coding sequences from 81 very early B subtype infections were analyzed to study the pattern of diversification of HIV-1 upon transmission to a new host. We find evidence of adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and identify a subset of codon sites that diversified more rapidly than can be explained by a model of neutral evolution. Of 24 such rapidly diversifying sites, 14 were either i ) clustered and embedded in CTL epitopes that were verified experimentally or predicted based on the individual's HLA or ii ) in a nucleotide context indicative of APOBEC-mediated G-to-A substitutions. In several cases, a rapidly evolving site was embedded both in an APOBEC motif and in a CTL epitope, suggesting that APOBEC may facilitate early immune escape. Ten rapidly diversifying sites could not be explained by CTL escape or APOBEC hypermutation, including the most frequently mutated site, in the fusion peptide of gp41. We also examined the distribution, extent, and sequence context of insertions and deletions, and we provide evidence that the length variation seen in hypervariable loop regions of the envelope glycoprotein is a consequence of selection and not of mutational hotspots. Our results provide a detailed view of the process of diversification of HIV-1 following transmission, highlighting the role of CTL escape and hypermutation in shaping viral evolution during the establishment of new infections.
The role of multiple epigenetic marks in the emergence of a stable bivalent chromatin state has been investigated in budding yeast. A minimal model of epigenetic silencing has been introduced and analyzed, which explicitly incorporates two key chromatin marks: H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation. We find that the presence of both modifications is important for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. Besides the silenced and transcriptionally active fate of chromatin, our model leads to a novel state with bivalent ( i. e., both active and silencing ) marks under certain perturbations ( knock-out mutations, inhibition or enhancement of enzymatic activity ). The bivalent state appears under several perturbations and is shown to result in patchy silencing. We also show that the titration effect, owing to a limited supply of silencing proteins, can result in counter-intuitive responses. The design principles of the silencing system are systematically investigated and disparate experimental observations are assessed within a single theoretical framework.
Severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) among children is a major health problem in developing countries, manifesting in both oedematous and non-oedematous forms. The pathogenesis of SAM remains largely unknown, but gut microbiota ( GM ) dysbiosis has recently been linked to oedematous malnutrition. We aimed to assess whether GM composition differed between Ugandan children suffering from either oedematous or non-oedematous malnutrition. As part of an observational study among children hospitalized with SAM aged 6–24 months in Uganda, fecal samples were collected at admission and analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis ( DGGE ) and tag-encoded 16S rRNA gene-targeted high throughput amplicon sequencing. We found that GM composition differed between the two groups of children, with non-oedematous children having lower GM alpha diversity. However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal larger differences between the GM of children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. Our results indicate that non-oedematous SAM children have lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children, but no clear compositional differences were identified.
Telomere length is a complex trait in yeast that is controlled by multiple loci and varies among individuals. We screened 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates and found extensive telomere length variation in S. paradoxus isolates, which correlated with their geographic origin. European strains had extremely short telomeres ( <150 bp ), whereas American isolates had telomeres approximately three times as long ( >400 bp ). We used insertions of a URA3 gene near telomeres to accurately analyze individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect ( TPE ). Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telomere lengths consistent with multiple quantitative trait loci ( QTLs ) being involved in length maintenance. Variation in TPE was similarly quantitative but only weakly correlated with telomere length. We identified several QTLs associated with telomere length and silencing variation, including likely candidate genes and regions with no known genes involved in telomeric properties. We detected transgressive segregation for both phenotypes and validated by reciprocal hemizygosity that YKU80 and TLC1 are telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. Furthermore, we propose that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis within one of the allelic combinations ( American-YKU70 and European-YKU80 ) resulting in very short telomeres.
Deciding Not to Decide: Computational and Neural Evidence for Hidden Behavior in Sequential Choice is a study that investigates the cognitive and neural processes that underlie human decision making in sequential choice paradigms. Sequential sampling models ( SSMs ) have greatly advanced the decision sciences by assuming that decisions emerge from a bounded evidence accumulation process. However, these models do not account for the possibility that people might decide to delay their choice and terminate the accumulation process temporarily. We developed several SSMs for predicting response times ( RTs ) from two independent samples of electroencephalography ( EEG ) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) studies. In these studies, participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues and were free to respond at any time. Standard SSM implementations did not describe RT distributions adequately. However, by adding a mechanism for postponing decisions to the model, we obtained an accurate fit to the data. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies ( 14–30 Hz ), indicating that responses were repeatedly prepared and inhibited. Finally, the extended model accounted for the results of an adapted version of our paradigm in which participants had to press a button for sampling more information. Our results show how computational modeling of decisions and RTs supports a deeper understanding of the hidden dynamics in cognition.
Hereditary nasal parakeratosis ( HNPK ) is a monogenic autosomal recessive skin disorder in Labrador Retrievers characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) of 13 HNPK cases and 23 controls identified a single strong association signal on chromosome 2. The analysis of shared haplotypes among the cases defined a critical interval of 1. 6 Mb with 25 predicted genes. A missense variant in the SUV39H2 gene, encoding a histone 3 lysine 9 ( H3K9 ) methyltransferase, was identified as the candidate causative variant. The variant c. 972T>G is predicted to change an evolutionary conserved asparagine into a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme ( p. N324K ). We further studied the histopathological alterations in the epidermis in vivo. Our data suggest that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. Thus, our data provide evidence that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis.
Influenza A viruses ( IAVs ) have the ability to undergo genetic reassortment, which can lead to the emergence of pandemic strains. Swine are considered a potential “mixing vessel” for generating reassortants of avian and mammalian IAVs that could pose a risk to humans. However, the process by which a transmissible reassortant emerges in swine is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the generation of reassortants between avian H1N1 and swine H3N2 IAVs in a group of co-housed pigs. We recovered 571 isolates from nasal wash samples and respiratory tract tissues of the pigs and identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants. We found that viruses recovered from lower respiratory tract tissues had the largest genomic diversity, and those recovered from turbinates and nasal wash fluids had the least. Reassortants from lower respiratory tracts had the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory tract epithelial cells, and the cold temperature in swine nasal cells seemed to select the type of reassortant viruses shed by the pigs. One reassortant was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tract tissues and was confirmed to be transmitted efficiently between pigs. Our findings suggest that genetic reassortments are likely to occur in the lower respiratory tract, and tissue tropism is an important factor in selecting for a transmissible reassortant.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. Maternal infection with S. mansoni during pregnancy may influence the immune responsiveness of offspring to schistosome infection and schistosomiasis-associated morbidity. However, the effects of praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni during pregnancy on the risk of S. mansoni infection among offspring and on their immune responsiveness when they become exposed to S. mansoni are unknown. In this study, we examined the effects of praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni during pregnancy on the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five years. We conducted a trial in Uganda in which offspring of women treated with praziquantel or placebo during pregnancy were examined for S. mansoni infection and for cytokine and antibody responses to schistosome antigens, as well as for T cell expression of FoxP3, at age five years. We found no evidence that maternal S. mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy influence the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection or effector immune response to S. mansoni infection among offspring at age five years. However, we found that praziquantel treatment of S. mansoni during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis, as evidenced by higher IL-10 responses to SWA among offspring of women treated with praziquantel during pregnancy.
Macrophages are immune cells that play a crucial role in clearing infectious pathogens from the body. However, how macrophage activation is coupled to increased clearance of pathogens remains largely unknown. Here, we show that inflammatory stimuli induce a reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, allowing for the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. This reprogramming occurs through protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which activates phosphoinositol ( PI ) -3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake. Importantly, expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 is sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. This suggests a hitherto unknown mechanism to regulate the internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation. We found that upon macrophage activation, serine phosphorylation of coronin 1 is the key molecular switch that reprograms the macrophage from a phagocytic uptake mode to macropinocytosis. Moreover, expression of a phosphomimetic mutant of coronin 1 resulted in all mycobacteria being transferred to lysosomes followed by their elimination, regardless of the macrophage activation state.
Sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ), is a neglected tropical disease endemic to the African continent. Tsetse flies are the primary vectors of the disease. In an effort to control tsetse populations, insecticide-treated targets are being deployed in the West Nile region of Uganda. We conducted a qualitative study in Arua District to assess the knowledge, perceptions, and acceptance of tsetse baits ( traps, targets ) in villages where they had or had not been used previously. We conducted 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across Arua District. Our results show that villagers who had never seen traps before expressed fear, anxiety, and panic due to associations with witchcraft and “ghosts from the river”, which are traditionally linked with physical or mental illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were fully aware of their purpose and benefits. The success of community-based interventions against tsetse will depend on early engagement with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns that reach all communities, especially those living in areas new to such interventions.
Recombination in Drosophila melanogaster is a fundamental biological process that has profound evolutionary implications. Recombination increases the effectiveness of selection in natural populations, but direct tests of this prediction have been restricted by the lack of detailed characterization of recombination rate variation across genomes and within species. Here, we report the first integrated high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination in D. melanogaster, distinguishing between the two outcomes of meiotic recombination: crossing over ( CO ) and gene conversion ( GC ). We characterized the products of 5, 860 female meioses by genotyping 139 million informative SNPs and mapped 106, 964 recombination events at a resolution down to 2 kilobases. This approach allowed us to generate whole-genome CO and GC maps as well as a detailed description of variation in recombination among individuals of this species. We describe many levels of variation in recombination rates, with CO rates exhibiting extreme and highly punctuated variation along chromosomes, and GC rates being more uniformly distributed across the genome. Recombination events are associated with numerous sequence motifs and tend to occur within transcript regions, suggesting that chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks.
IDN2 and its paralogs, IDP1 and IDP2, form a complex required for RNA-directed DNA methylation ( RdDM ) in Arabidopsis thaliana. IDP1 is required for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing, whereas IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1. Unlike IDN2, IDP1 and IDP2 are incapable of binding double-stranded RNA. The IDN2 coiled-coil domain is essential for IDN2 homodimerization, whereas the IDN2 C-terminal XH domain is required for IDN2 interaction with IDP1 and IDP2. The IDN2 XH domain is essential for the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex formation as well as for IDN2 function in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing. IDP1 and IDP2 belong to a different subfamily from IDN2 and its close homologs. IDN2 interacts with itself via the coiled-coil domain, whereas it interacts with IDP1 and IDP2 via the XH domain. Mutations in the IDN2 XH domain caused the mutated IDN2 transgenes to fail to complement the DNA methylation defect of idn2 at a canonical RdDM target.
Leishmania braziliensis, the causative agent of New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, triggers neutrophil activation and apoptosis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to the sites of L. braziliensis inoculation. In this study, we investigated the interaction between neutrophils and L. braziliensis, focusing on cell activation and apoptotic fate. We found that inoculation of serum-opsonized L. braziliensis promastigotes in mice induced neutrophil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 h. In vitro, exposure of neutrophils to L. braziliensis modulated the expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62L, and induced the oxidative burst. Neutrophil activation following contact with L. braziliensis was confirmed by the release of TNF-α and neutrophil elastase. Moreover, neutrophils infected with L. braziliensis but not with L. major displayed markers of early apoptosis. We show that L. braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact on parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection.
Bovine tuberculosis ( bTB ) is a major disease affecting cattle worldwide, and vaccination is not currently used in international control programs due to interference with the tuberculin skin test. However, new diagnostic tests that can Differentiate Infected from Vaccinated Animals ( DIVA ) offer the potential to introduce vaccination within existing eradication programs. We use within-herd transmission models estimated from historical data from Great Britain to explore the feasibility of using BCG vaccination as a supplementary control measure. The economic impact of bTB on farmers is dominated by the costs associated with testing and restrictions on animal movements. We find that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than its sensitivity, is the greatest barrier to seeing a herd level benefit of vaccination under the intensive testing regime used in Great Britain. We estimate that a DIVA specificity of at least 99. 85% and sensitivity of >40% is required to see a protective benefit of vaccination with no increase in the risk of missed infection. Using a cocktail of three DIVA antigens, we estimate that this target specificity could be achieved in vaccinates while maintaining a sensitivity of 73. 3% relative to post-mortem detection.
Trichuris trichiura, a parasitic whipworm, infects approximately 500 million people worldwide, causing physical growth and educational performance damage. Current treatments are limited and lack efficacy against the parasite, hindering eradication efforts. To develop new treatments, we screened a library of 480 novel small molecules against Trichuris muris, an established model for T. trichiura. We identified a class of dihydrobenz[e][1, 4]oxazepin-2 ( 3H ) -one compounds with anthelmintic activity against T. muris. Further screening and resynthesis led to the identification of 20 active dihydrobenzoxazepinones, a new class of molecules not previously implicated in nematode control. The most active compounds immobilised adult T. muris with EC50 values around 25–50μM, comparable to the existing anthelmintic levamisole. These compounds showed low cytotoxicity against murine gut epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. Importantly, the dihydrobenzoxazepinone OX02983 reduced the ability of embryonated T. muris eggs to establish infection in the mouse host in vivo. This supports an alternative strategy of developing a therapeutic that acts in the environment to interrupt the parasite lifecycle.
The distinction between date and party hubs in protein–protein interaction networks is re-examined in this study. Date hubs are characterised by low co-expression with their interaction partners, whereas party hubs have high co-expression. It was previously proposed that party hubs act as local coordinators and date hubs as global connectors. However, we show that the importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of highly central hubs, which do not display low expression correlation with their partners. This challenges the idea of a link between expression correlation and hub function. We also find that the bimodal distribution of hub co-expression, which motivated the date/party distinction, is not robust to methodological changes. Furthermore, we show that topological properties of hubs do not generally correlate with co-expression. In contrast, we find significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional similarity of interacting proteins.
Pathogen genome sequences are increasingly used to reconstruct transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks. However, a fundamental limitation of such approaches is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. We introduce the concept of ‘transmission divergence’, defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs, to quantify and compare the useful genetic diversity expected from genetic data in different pathogen outbreaks. Using parameter values obtained by literature review, we simulated outbreak scenarios alongside sequence evolution for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. We find that while mean values vary significantly between pathogens, their transmission divergence is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterised by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. We demonstrate that genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens such as RNA viruses can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, whereas sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events. Our results highlight the informational limitations of genetic sequence data in certain outbreak scenarios, and demonstrate the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data.
X chromosome inactivation ( XCI ) is a process that silences most genes on one X chromosome in female mammals. However, some genes escape XCI and are expressed from both X chromosomes. To identify escape genes in vivo and explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process, we analyzed the allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed XCI and distinguishable alleles. Using a binomial model to assess allelic expression, we demonstrate a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X ( Xi ). Overall, few genes ( 3–7% ) escape XCI in any of the mouse tissues examined, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro system represented by the embryonic-kidney-derived Patski cell line showed a higher density of escape genes ( 21% ). We identified both common escape genes and genes with significant differences in XCI status between tissues, which may be candidates for tissue-specific sex differences. We also found that allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase I hypersensitivity at the promoter of genes on the Xi correlated well with levels of escape, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes.
Plasmodium vivax is one of the most predominant human malaria species worldwide, causing hundreds of millions of illnesses each year. Cysteine proteases of malaria parasites are essential for the parasite's survival, involved in physiological processes such as hemoglobin degradation, processing of food vacuole plasmepsins, and erythrocyte rupture. However, comprehensive studies of P. vivax cysteine proteases have been hindered by an inability to culture P. vivax. In this study, we describe the biochemical properties of a novel cysteine protease of P. vivax, designated as vivapain-4 ( VX-4 ). VX-4 has dual substrate specificity depending on the surrounding micro-environmental pH, with highest hydrolyzing activity against benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Arg-4-methyl-coumaryl-7-amide ( Z-Leu-Arg-MCA ) and Z-Phe-Arg-MCA at acidic pH ( 5. 5 ), and against Z-Arg-Arg-MCA at neutral pH ( 6. 5–7. 5 ). VX-4 preferred positively charged amino acids and Gln at the P1 position, with less strict specificity at P3 and P4. VX-4 was localized in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax. VX-4 showed maximal activity against actin at neutral pH, and that against P. vivax plasmepsin 4 and hemoglobin was detected at neutral/acidic and acidic pH, respectively. VX-4 demonstrates pH-dependent substrate switching, which might offer an efficient mechanism for the specific cleavage of different substrates in different intracellular environments.
Acetogens are ideal candidates for biotechnological production of commodity chemicals due to their unique ability to ferment a broad range of substrates, including H2:CO2 or syngas. However, advanced design strategies for acetogens are hampered by incomplete knowledge about their physiology and the inability to accurately predict phenotypes. Here, we describe the reconstruction of a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis ( ME-model ) for the model acetogen Clostridium ljungdahlii. The completed ME-model, named iJL965-ME, captures all major central metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, major cofactors, and vitamin synthesis pathways as well as pathways to synthesis RNA and protein molecules necessary to catalyze these reactions. This model represents the first ME-model of a Gram-positive bacterium and significantly broadens the scope and predictability of microbial systems biology. Using the model, we revealed how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens and accurately predicted secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol. Furthermore, we predicted and experimentally validated changing secretion rates based on different metal availability, which opens the window into fermentation optimization and provides new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.
Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) are moving towards the use of large cohorts of primary cell lines to study a disease of interest and to assign biological relevance to the genetic signals identified. Here, we use a panel of human osteoblasts ( HObs ) to carry out a transcriptomic survey, similar to recent studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines ( LCLs ). We performed cis-association analysis with SNP genotypes to identify genetic variations of transcript isoforms, and our analysis indicates that differential expression of transcript isoforms in HObs is also partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. These isoforms are regulated by genetic variants in both a tissue-specific and tissue-independent fashion, and these associations have been confirmed by RT–PCR validation. Our study suggests that multiple transcript isoforms are often present in both tissues and that genetic control may affect the relative expression of one isoform to another, rather than having an all-or-none effect. Examination of the top SNPs from a GWAS of bone mineral density show overlap with probeset associations observed in this study. Our approach to examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types is useful for detecting the proportion of genetic variation common to different cell types and for the identification of cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant, an important follow-up step for GWAS.
Saccharomyces eubayanus CBS 12357T, the non-S. cerevisiae parent of the lager-brewing hybrid S. pastorianus, is unable to utilize maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer’s wort. In contrast, most S. cerevisiae and Frohberg-type S. pastorianus strains can utilize maltotriose. S. eubayanus CBS 12357T harbors four SeMALT genes that enable uptake of the α-di-glucoside maltose, but lacks maltotriose transporter genes. To study the evolvability of maltotriose utilization in S. eubayanus CBS 12357T, maltotriose-assimilating mutants were obtained after UV mutagenesis and subjected to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltotriose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltotriose fermentation in 7 L fermenter experiments on industrial wort. Whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene, resulting from repeated gene introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted tertiary structure of SeMalT413 was comparable to the original SeMalT transporters, but overexpression of SeMALT413 sufficed to enable growth on maltotriose. The mosaic structure of SeMALT413 resembles the structure of S. pastorianus maltotriose-transporter gene SpMTY1, which has high sequence identity to alternatingly S. cerevisiae MALx1, S. paradoxus MALx1 and S. eubayanus SeMALT3.
Influenza viruses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and timely and accurate assessment of their impact on human death is invaluable for influenza planning. However, current approaches rely mostly on intensive and unbiased influenza surveillance, which presents a substantial challenge. In this study, we propose a novel host-virus interaction model and establish a positive correlation between the excess mortalities caused by viral strains of distinct antigenicity and their antigenic distances to their previous strains for each ( sub ) type of seasonal influenza viruses. We further develop a method to rapidly assess the mortality burden of influenza A ( H1N1 ) virus by accurately predicting the antigenic distance between A ( H1N1 ) strains based on their HA sequences. Our method is based on a simplified host-virus interaction model that considers only the strains of distinct antigenicity that cause significant infection in the human population. We evaluate the ability of our method, called EADpred, to predict antigenic distance with a relatively high accuracy, suggesting its potential utility in the rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden. We further evaluate how well the predicted antigenic distance of A ( H1N1 ) virus correlates with the observed excess mortality and find a direct and positive correlation between the extent of antigenic variation of an influenza virus and the total excess mortality it may cause. We believe that our method will be useful for rapid assessment of the influenza mortality burden of other future A ( H1N2 ) and B viruses with proper modification.
The Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, is an obligate biotrophic pathogen that causes severe soybean disease epidemics. The molecular mechanisms by which P. pachyrhizi and other rust fungi interact with their host plants are poorly understood. Here, we present the characterization of P. pachyrhizi effector candidate 23 ( PpEC23 ), a small, secreted cysteine-rich protein ( SSCRP ) that suppresses plant immunity. We show that PpEC23 interacts with soybean transcription factor GmSPL12l and that soybean plants in which GmSPL12l is silenced have constitutively active immunity, thereby identifying GmSPL12l as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Collectively, our data present evidence for a virulence function of a rust SSCRP and suggest that PpEC23 is able to suppress soybean immune responses and physically interact with soybean transcription factor GmSPL12l, a negative immune regulator.
Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that invades host cells to replicate inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. We have identified the cell surface tyrosine kinase EphrinA2 receptor ( EphA2 ) as a chlamydial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) activation, promoting chlamydial replication. C. trachomatis serovar L2 ( Ctr ) interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface resulting in Ctr and receptor internalization. During chlamydial replication, EphA2 remains active accumulating around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to support the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway that is required for normal chlamydial development. Overexpression of full length EphA2, but not the mutant form lacking the intracellular cytoplasmic domain, enhanced PI3K activation and Ctr infection. Despite the depletion of EphA2 from the cell surface, Ctr infection induces upregulation of EphA2 through the activation of the ERK pathway, which keeps the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. The significance of EphA2 as an entry and intracellular signaling receptor was also observed with the urogenital C. trachomatis-serovar D. Our findings provide the first evidence for a host cell surface receptor that is exploited for invasion as well as for receptor-mediated intracellular signaling to facilitate chlamydial replication.
Active dendrites in neurons have been shown to exhibit excitability through the expression of voltage-gated ion channels. However, the role of this excitability for dendritic computation has remained elusive. Here, we show that the average output of a model of an active dendritic tree is a highly non-linear function of its afferent rate, attaining extremely large dynamic ranges ( above 50 dB ). Moreover, the model yields double-sigmoid response functions as experimentally observed in retinal ganglion cells. We propose that enhancement of dynamic range is the primary functional role of active dendritic conductances. We predict that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic range and that blocking of active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range.
The inference of regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data has been extensively studied. However, existing methods are based on implicit assumptions that are often not valid and bias the reverse engineering process. These assumptions include that measurements of mRNA abundance are representative of protein concentrations and that observed changes in gene expression are solely due to transcription factors and other specific regulators. Here, we investigate the importance of this bias and possible corrections using a combination of models and experiments. We measure in real time and in vivo the activity of genes involved in the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network and estimate protein concentrations and global physiological effects by means of kinetic models of gene expression. Our results indicate that correcting for the bias of commonly-made assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. Moreover, we show by simulation that these improvements are expected to be even stronger for systems in which protein concentrations have longer half-lives and the activity of the gene expression machinery varies more strongly across conditions than in the FliA-FlgM module. We propose new controls for transcriptome experiments and mathematical models for reconstructing protein concentrations and integrating global physiological effects into the network inference process. Our results demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters.
Zoonotic pathogens, such as hantavirus, are maintained in natural systems by their rodent reservoirs. However, few studies have been conducted at a microscale over short time periods to better capture the dynamical patterns of key populations. This study characterizes the landscape distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of Oligoryzomys fulvescens ( O. fulvescens ), an important mammalian reservoir in Central America, in the community of Agua Buena in Tonosí, Panama, between April 2006 and December 2009. A 90 node grid was built to design a base map of the study area ( 2. 39 x 2. 69 km ). The temporal assessment dataset was divided into four periods for each year studied: the dry season, rainy season, and two months-long transitions between seasons. Spatial autocorrelation analyses indicated that local populations of O. fulvescens encompassed approximately 300–600 m. The species typically was locally absent during the late transitional months of the season, and re-established locally in subsequent years. These populations re-occurred in the same area during the first three years but subsequently re-established further south in the final year of the study. Our results provide an important characterization of the challenges in monitoring or predicting zoonotic disease outbreaks at the level of reservoir populations. These populations are subject to fluctuations over time ( both within and among years ), and the populations themselves are geographically restricted, even within their range.
The antigenic evolution of human influenza A ( H3N2 ) viruses has been studied by developing a computational method for inferring ‘antigenic trees’. These trees represent the antigenic evolution of the major viral surface protein hemagglutinin over a 35-year period from 1968 to 2003. The method is based on a least-squares optimization procedure that fits pairwise antigenic distances between isolates onto an evolutionary tree for the major antigenic determinant of influenza A. This allows for a more fine-grained resolution of the antigenic impact of individual amino acid changes than antigenic cartography. The method can be used to identify areas and branches in the tree corresponding to known antigenic types and transitions between these types. It can also be used to identify isolates and associated changes with large antigenic impact, which need to be identified for vaccine strain updates prior to antigenic type transitions. The method is not restricted to the analysis of influenza viruses or antigenic distance information, but can be applied to the study of any system where homologous genetic sequences and associated pairwise phenotype distances are available.
Human papillomavirus type 16 ( HPV16 ) requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for nuclear import of its viral DNA ( vDNA ). A large-scale RNA interference ( RNAi ) screen was used to identify host cell factors and processes involved in HPV16 infection. The screen revealed a cluster of mitotic genes and a previously undetermined mechanism for vDNA import into the nucleus. In interphase cells, viruses were endocytosed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but the vDNA failed to be imported into the nucleus. However, upon nuclear envelope perforation in interphase cells, HPV16 infection occurred. During mitosis, the vDNA and L2 associated with host cell chromatin on the metaphase plate. We propose that HPV16 requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for access of the vDNA to the nucleoplasm. The results highlight the value of genes found by RNAi screens for investigation of viral infections. The list of cell functions required during HPV16 infection will provide a resource for future virus-host cell interaction studies.
Black Sigatoka or black leaf streak disease, caused by the Dothideomycete fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis, is the most significant foliar disease of banana worldwide. Due to the lack of effective host resistance, management of this disease requires frequent fungicide applications, which greatly increase the economic and environmental costs to produce banana. To combat this disease, the genomes of two strains of P. fijiensis were sequenced and assembled with the aid of a new genetic linkage map. The 74-Mb genome of P. fijiensis is massively expanded by LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. The genomes of two closely related members of the Sigatoka disease complex, P. eumusae and P. musae, also show expansion. The P. fijiensis genome will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules to combat this pathogen and in improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs. A homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector, PfAvr4, was identified in the P. fijiensis genome. Infiltration of the purified PfAVR4 protein into leaves of the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4 resulted in a hypersensitive-like response, suggesting that Calcutta 4 could carry an unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAVR4.
The evolution of lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites is thought to be a major contributor to the evolution of species-specific traits. However, most computational approaches to study regulatory elements focus on highly conserved sites and rely heavily on multiple sequence alignments. These approaches have limited ability to detect lineage-specific elements that could contribute to species-specific traits. Here, we describe a novel framework that utilizes a birth-death model to trace the evolution of lineage-specific binding sites without relying on detailed cross-species alignments. We applied our method to ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors ( GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, ETS1 ) along the lineage toward human after the human-mouse common ancestor. We estimate that a substantial fraction of binding sites ( ∼58–79% for each factor ) in humans have origins since the divergence with mouse. Over 15% of all binding sites are unique to hominids. These elements are often enriched near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more common SNPs than older binding sites in the human genome. Our results support the ability of our method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and help understand their roles in shaping variation in gene regulation across species.
The zebrafish is a vertebrate model for studying how light entrains the endogenous circadian clock. Unlike mammals, most zebrafish tissues are directly exposed to light, leading to local clock entrainment. We investigated how light regulates the expression of the zebrafish period2 ( per2 ) gene, which plays a key role in mediating the effects of light on the circadian clock. Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell line–based assays, we identified a Light Responsive Module ( LRM ) within the per2 promoter that is both necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian clock regulation. The LRM lies proximal to the transcription start site and contains E- and D-box elements that are critical for its function. While the E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor ( tef ) binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. We demonstrate that tef mRNA levels are light inducible and that knock-down of tef expression attenuates light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. Our results support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression.
The actin filament-binding protein coronin plays a crucial role in regulating motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. Here we show that coronin is required for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice as parasites lacking coronin show defects in salivary gland invasion. Coronin localizes to the periphery of sporozoites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and actively contributes to parasite motility through actin filament-binding. Importantly, coronin organizes actin filaments for productive motility and is essential for efficient transmission of malaria. We found that protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly and that calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling regulate a switch from rapid parasite motility to host cell invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics. During the rapid onset of migration, extracellular ligands first trigger intracellular calcium release prior to actin filament formation and coronin relocalization to the rear of the gliding sporozoite.
Amphotericin B ( AmB ) is an important drug used to treat leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. However, the potential for resistance to this drug is a considerable threat. Here, we characterised four novel AmB-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines and found that they all exhibited altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole genome sequencing revealed that one line had a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase, while three lines had a loss of expression of the sterol C24-methyltransferase ( SMT ) gene, which is responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. SMT is encoded by two tandem gene copies, which have very different expression levels. We found that reduced overall expression of SMT was associated with loss of the 3’ untranslated region of the dominant gene copy, resulting from structural variations at this locus. These structural variations correlated with the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements that promote multi-gene amplification. We also found that loss of SMT expression was not associated with loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo.
Predictive coding theory suggests that attention optimises the expected precision of predictions by modulating the synaptic gain of prediction error units in the brain. Prediction errors code for the difference between predictions and sensory signals, and attention is thought to increase the selectivity for mismatch information in the neural response to a surprising stimulus. Here, we applied forward encoding models to neural activity recorded via electroencephalography ( EEG ) as human observers performed a simple visual task to test for the effect of attention on both mismatch and feature information in the neural response to surprising stimuli. Participants attended or ignored a periodic stream of gratings, the orientations of which could be either predictable, surprising, or unpredictable. We found that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features, and that attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain. These findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain, as well as support the theory that attention optimises precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.
Trypanosoma brucei brucei is unable to infect humans because it is sensitive to trypanosome lytic factors ( TLF ) 1 and 2 found in human serum. In contrast, T. b. rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense are able to resist lysis by TLF. T. b. gambiense is further divided into two distinct sub-groups that differ genetically and by human serum resistance phenotypes. Group 1 T. b. gambiense is resistant to TLF-1 due in part to reduced uptake of TLF-1 mediated by reduced expression of the TLF-1 receptor ( the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor ( HpHbR ) ) gene. However, group 2 T. b. gambiense exhibits variable resistance to TLF-1. Our data indicate that group 2 T. b. gambiense is innately resistant to the main lytic component of TLF-1, APOL1, which could be based on the same mechanism as group 1 T. b. gambiense. However, group 2 T. b. gambiense variably displays this phenotype and expression does not appear to correlate with a change in expression site or expression of HpHbR. Thus, there are differences in the mechanism of human serum resistance between T. b. gambiense groups 1 and 2.
DNA methylation of the HIV-1 5′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ) has been proposed as a mechanism of transcriptional suppression. However, the role of DNA methylation in the control of HIV-1 latency has not been unambiguously demonstrated. Here, we show that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR is an additional epigenetic restriction mechanism that controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals and thus determines the stability of the HIV-1 latency. In an in vitro model of reactivable latency and in a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients, we found that CpG methylation acts as a late event during establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for the initial provirus silencing. The latent reservoir of some aviremic patients contained high proportions of the non-methylated 5′ LTR. In contrast, the latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected individuals without detectable plasma viremia contained HIV-1 promoters and enhancers to be hypermethylated and resistant to reactivation. However, even dense methylation of the HIV-1 5′ LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation of latent HIV-1 with some histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein kinase C agonists, TNF-α, and their combinations with 5-aza-2deoxycytidine. Our results explain the ambiguous conclusions emerging from methylation studies in cell lines latently infected with HIV-1 and correlate the in vitro data with data from HIV-1-infected patients.
The Drosophila melanogaster Genetic Reference Panel ( DGRP ) is a collection of 39 inbred lines used to study the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation. Here, we present a nucleotide resolution catalog of single-nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants in the DGRP lines. We identified more than 3. 6 million distinct variants, among which were more than 800, 000 unique insertions, deletions ( indels ), and complex variants ( 1 to 6, 000 bp ). We found that variants themselves are not mutagenic, nor are regions with high variant density particularly mutation-prone. Rather, the elevated SNP density around variants is mainly due to population-level processes. We mapped cis-expression quantitative trait loci ( cis-eQTLs ) for more than 2, 000 genes and found that indels comprise around 10% of all cis-eQTLs and show larger effects than SNP cis-eQTLs. We also identified two-fold more gene associations in males as compared to females and found that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, revealing a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between the sexes. Finally, we performed RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses in the offspring of crosses between sequenced lines, which revealed that the majority of strong cis-eQTLs can be validated in heterozygous individuals.
Amplitude cancellation in the rectified surface electromyogram (EMG) signal distorts its correlation with the neural drive to the muscle. The neural drive is the ensemble of discharge timings of all motor neurons innervating the muscle. In this study, we investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on this correlation using analytical derivations and a computational model of motor neuron activity, force, and the EMG signal. We demonstrated analytically that an ideal rectified EMG signal without amplitude cancellation is superior to the actual rectified EMG signal as an estimator of the neural drive to the muscle. This observation was confirmed by simulations, which showed that the correlation between the neural drive in the 1–30 Hz band and the ideal rectified EMG ( r2 = 0. 59±0. 08 ) was matched by the correlation between the actual rectified EMG and the neural drive only when the level of amplitude cancellation was low ( <40% ) at low contraction levels ( <5% of maximum voluntary contraction force; MVC ). However, this correlation decreased linearly with amplitude cancellation ( r = -0. 83 ) to values of r2 <0. 2 at amplitude cancellation levels >60% ( contraction levels >15% MVC ). The simulations also showed that a stronger neural drive implied a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive, and that amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components ( <5 Hz ) of the neural drive.
Root growth in Arabidopsis thaliana is inhibited in response to aluminium ( Al ) stress, and auxin is necessary for this inhibition. However, the molecular mechanism controlling this process is largely unknown. Here, we report that YUCCA ( YUC ), which encodes flavin monooxygenase-like proteins, regulates local auxin biosynthesis in the root apex transition zone ( TZ ) in response to Al stress. We show that Al stress up-regulates YUC3/5/7/8/9 in the root-apex TZ, resulting in the accumulation of auxin in the root-apex TZ and root-growth inhibition during the Al stress response. These Al-dependent changes in the regulation of YUCs in the root-apex TZ and YUC-regulated root growth inhibition are dependent on ethylene signalling. Furthermore, ethylene enhances root growth inhibition under Al stress, which is strongly alleviated in yuc mutants or by co-treatment with yucasin, an inhibitor of YUC activity. We also show that ethylene-insensitive 3 ( EIN3 ) is involved in the direct regulation of YUC9 transcription, and that PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 ( PIF4 ) functions as a transcriptional activator for YUC5/8/9. PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating the local expression of YUCs and auxin signal in the root-apex TZ.
Immunodeficiency viruses, such as simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ), can modulate natural killer ( NK ) cell responses by stabilizing interactions between major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules and inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( KIRs ) on NK cells. We investigated the functional implications of these interactions by testing SIV peptides bound by a common MHC class I molecule in rhesus macaques, Mamu-A1*002, for the ability to modulate Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cell responses. We found that 28 of 75 SIV peptides bound by Mamu-A1*002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of primary Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells, including three immunodominant CD8+ T cell epitopes previously shown to stabilize Mamu-A1*002 tetramer binding to Mamu-KIR3DL05. Substitutions at C-terminal positions changed inhibitory peptides into disinhibitory peptides, and vice versa, without altering binding to Mamu-A1*002. The functional effects of these peptide variants on NK cell responses also corresponded to their effects on Mamu-A1*002 tetramer binding to Mamu-KIR3DL05. In assays with mixtures of inhibitory and disinhibitory peptides, low concentrations of inhibitory peptides dominated to suppress NK cell responses. Consistent with the inhibition of Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells by viral epitopes presented by Mamu-A1*002, SIV replication was significantly higher in Mamu-A1*002+ CD4+ lymphocytes co-cultured with Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells than with Mamu-KIR3DL05- NK cells. These results demonstrate that viral peptides can differentially affect NK cell responses by modulating MHC class I interactions with inhibitory KIRs, and provide a mechanism by which immunodeficiency viruses may evade NK cell responses.
Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHI ) is a common cause of otitis media ( OM ), a bacterial infection of the middle ear. In this study, we investigated how NTHI adapts to transient nutrient limitation, such as heme-iron restriction, and how this adaptation affects its ability to colonize and persist in the middle ear. We hypothesized that NTHI strains adapted to nutrient limitation are more adept at colonizing and evading host immune responses, resulting in persistence. To test this hypothesis, we isolated NTHI strains from the middle ear effusion ( MEE ) and nasopharynx ( NP ) of children with active OM and sequenced the icc gene, which encodes for 3’, 5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) phosphodiesterase. We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism in icc that abolishes cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in the icc mutant strain. In a preclinical model of NTHI-induced OM, we observed that the icc mutant strain formed significantly more intracellular bacterial communities ( IBCs ) than the parental strain at early stages of infection. In contrast, the parental strain formed more IBCs at later stages of infection, coinciding with the absence of recoverable effusion, suggesting the presence of a mucosal reservoir following resolution of clinical disease. These data provide the first insight into NTHI microevolution during nutritional limitation and demonstrate the formation of IBCs in a preclinical model of chronic OM.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate iron availability and intracellular survival. Infection of primary macrophages with B. pseudomallei results in downregulation of the iron exporter ferroportin, leading to increased iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of iron export function by hepcidin or iron supplementation by ferric ammonium citrate stimulates B. pseudomallei growth, whereas the iron chelator deferoxamine reduces bacterial survival. Iron-loaded macrophages exhibit a lower expression of NADPH oxidase, iNOS, lipocalin 2, cytokines, and activation of caspase-1. Infection of mice with B. pseudomallei causes a diminished hepatic ferroportin expression, higher iron retention in the liver, and lower iron levels in the serum ( hypoferremia ). In vivo administration of ferric ammonium citrate tends to promote bacterial growth and inflammatory response, whereas limitation of iron availability significantly ameliorates bacterial clearance, attenuates serum cytokine levels, and improves survival of infected mice.
Proteins accomplish their biological function through collective atomic motions. However, identifying collective motions related to a specific protein function from a molecular dynamics trajectory is often non-trivial. We propose a novel technique termed “functional mode analysis” ( FMA ) that aims to detect the collective motion directly related to a particular protein function. FMA is based on an ensemble of structures and an arbitrary “functional quantity” that quantifies the functional state of the protein. The functional quantity can correspond to a geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observable, or any other variable relevant to the function of the protein. FMA detects the collective motion that is maximally correlated to the functional quantity and estimates the motion that displays the largest likelihood to induce a substantial change in the functional quantity. Two correlation measures are applied: the Pearson correlation coefficient, which measures linear correlation only, and the mutual information, which can assess any kind of interdependence. The new approach is illustrated using a number of biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein. In contrast to established methods such as principal component analysis and normal mode analysis, FMA aims to elucidate collective motions directly related to protein function.
Nonconventional introns are a type of intron found in the nuclear genes of euglenids and marine diplonemids that do not have the conserved borders characteristic of spliceosomal introns or the sequence complementary to U1 snRNA at the 5' end. These introns form a stable secondary structure that brings together both exon/intron junctions, but this conformation does not resemble the form of self-splicing or tRNA introns. In the genes studied so far, nonconventional introns have been found to insert at new positions, whereas conventional introns have been found at conserved positions or have been lost. In this work, we examined the order of intron removal from Euglena gracilis transcripts of the tubA and gapC genes, which contain both nonconventional and spliceosomal introns. The relative order of intron excision was compared for pairs of introns belonging to different types, and intermediate products of splicing were analyzed using the PacBio Next Generation Sequencing system. The results show that nonconventional introns are removed in a rapid way but later than spliceosomal introns. Furthermore, the observed accumulation of transcripts with conventional introns removed and nonconventional introns present may suggest the existence of a time gap between the two types of splicing.
Coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) is an enterovirus that commonly causes a self-limited febrile illness in infants, but severe cases can manifest as acute myocarditis. Although the chronic consequences of mild CVB3 infection are unknown, there is an epidemiologic association between early subclinical infections and late heart failure. Here, we describe a mouse model of juvenile infection with a subclinical dose of CVB3, which showed no evident symptoms immediately following infection or in adult mice. However, following physiological or pharmacologically-induced cardiac stress, juvenile-infected adult mice underwent cardiac hypertrophy and dilation indicative of progression to heart failure. Evaluation of the vasculature in the hearts of adult mice subjected to cardiac stress showed a compensatory increase in CD31+ blood vessel formation, although this effect was suppressed in juvenile-infected mice. Moreover, CVB3 efficiently infected juvenile c-kit+ cells, and cardiac progenitor cell numbers were reduced in the hearts of juvenile-infected adult mice. These results suggest that the exhausted cardiac progenitor cell pool following juvenile CVB3 infection may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density to adapt to increased load.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, regulates IL-1β and IL-18 production through NLRP3 and pyroptosis via NLRC4. However, the downstream signalling pathways of these receptors and other cell death mechanisms induced during B. pseudomallei infection are not well understood. In this study, we show that caspase-1 processing and pyroptosis are exclusively dependent on NLRC4 in the early phase of macrophage infection, but not on NLRP3. At later time points, caspase-1 activation and cell death are NLRC4-independent. We identified an activation pathway involving caspases-9, -7 and PARP downstream of NLRC4 and caspase-1 in the early phase of infection. Analyses of caspase-1/11-deficient infected macrophages revealed a strong induction of apoptosis, which is dependent on activation of apoptotic initiator and effector caspases. The early activation pathway of caspase-1 in macrophages was markedly reduced or completely abolished after infection with a B. pseudomallei flagellin FliC or a T3SS3 BsaU mutant. Our results indicate a major role for a functional T3SS3 in early NLRC4-mediated caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis and a contribution of late caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death mechanisms in the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei infection.
The Arabidopsis KINβγ subunit of the SNF1-related protein kinase 1 ( SnRK1 ) complex plays a critical role in regulating pollen hydration on the stigma by mediating the level of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) in pollen. We found that KINβγ is a cytoplasm- and nucleus-localized protein in the vegetative cells of pollen grains in Arabidopsis. The pollen of the Arabidopsis kinβγ mutant could not germinate on the stigma, although it germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that the hydration of kinβγ mutant pollen on the stigma was compromised. However, adding water to the stigma promoted the germination of the mutant pollen in vivo, suggesting that the compromised hydration of the mutant pollen led to its defective germination. We also found that the kinβγ mutant exhibited reduced levels of ROS in pollen. The addition of H2O2 in vitro partially compensated for the reduced water absorption of the mutant pollen, and reducing ROS levels in pollen by overexpressing Arabidopsis CATALASE 3 resulted in compromised hydration of pollen on the stigma. These results indicate that Arabidopsis KINβγ is critical for the regulation of ROS levels by mediating the biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is required for pollen–stigma interactions during pollination.
RNase III is an enzyme involved in the cleavage of double-stranded RNA in many biological systems. In bacteria, RNase III plays a role in ribosomal RNA maturation and mRNA turnover. However, in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, RNase III is essential for cell survival. Here, we show that the essential role of RNase III in B. subtilis is to protect it from the expression of toxin genes borne by two prophages, Skin and SPβ, through antisense RNA. These prophages encode two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txpA and yonT, which are sensitive to RNase III. In the absence of these prophages or these two toxin-encoding mRNAs, deletion of the RNase III gene is possible and the growth rate of the resulting strains is hardly affected. We further explore the mechanism of RNase III–mediated decay of the txpA mRNA when paired to its antisense RNA RatA, both in vivo and in vitro. The essential role of RNase III in B. subtilis is not related to its function in rRNA metabolism or in the maturation of the scRNA, part of the essential 4. 5S particle involved in co-translational insertion of proteins in the cellular membrane.
The filarial nematode Brugia malayi is an etiological agent of Lymphatic Filariasis. We have profiled the release of extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) by B. malayi across all intra-mammalian life cycle stages ( microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male and female worms ). We used Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis to quantify and size EVs, revealing discrete vesicle populations and a secretory process that is conserved across the life cycle. Brugia EVs are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking. Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome, helping to define the biogenesis of Brugia EVs and revealing sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo. Finally, we found that ivermectin rapidly inhibits EV release by all Brugia life stages. This effect was also observed in the related filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis, but not in an ivermectin-unresponsive field isolate of that parasite.
Scabies and impetigo are highly prevalent in the rural Western Province of the Solomon Islands. In a cross-sectional survey of 1908 residents from ten villages, the total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19. 2% ( 95% CI 17. 5–21. 0 ), with the highest prevalence found in infants < 1 year of age ( 34. 1% ) and children aged 1–4 years ( 25. 7% ). The prevalence of active impetigo was 32. 7% ( 95% CI 30. 6–34. 8 ), with the highest prevalence found in children aged 1–4 years ( 42. 6% ). Scabies infestation was strongly associated with active impetigo infection ( AOR 2. 0, 95% CI 1. 6–2. 6 ), with 41. 1% of active impetigo cases also having scabies. Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80. 9% of participants, and 4. 4% of scabies cases were classified as severe.
Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus of mice continues to occur throughout life. However, the function of this process remains unclear. In this study, we found a highly significant correlation between cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and the proportions of CD8+ versus CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets. This correlation is driven by shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2Ea locus, which has a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. We also found that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof mediate the effect of T cells on adult neurogenesis. Our results reveal a broader role for T cell function on adult neurogenesis than previously suspected. We analyzed a large stock of outbred mice and found that the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus is not an artefact of transgenic or knockout mice, but rather arises from the subtle cues of natural genetic variation. We found that loci that contribute to variation in cell proliferation in the hippocampus also contribute to variation in the relative proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. The correlation accounts for about 6% of the phenotypic variance and is much larger than that found for over 90 other phenotypes.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is a major health problem in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US. In this study, we investigated the protective efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine ( TcVac2 ) in a murine model. TcVac2 was constituted of antigens identified by computational analysis of the T. cruzi sequence database and cytokine ( IL-12 and GM-CSF ) expression plasmids. C57BL/6 mice were immunized with antigen-encoding plasmids plus cytokine adjuvants, followed by recombinant proteins, and then challenged with T. cruzi trypomastigotes. TcVac2 induced a strong antigen-specific antibody response and a moderate level of lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge infection, TcVac2-vaccinated mice expanded the IgG2b/IgG1 antibodies and elicited a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines ( IFN-γ and TNF-α ) that resulted in control of acute parasite burden. During the chronic phase, antibody response persisted, and the tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in heart and skeletal muscle of TcVac2-vaccinated mice were undetectable by histological techniques. In contrast, mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded to T. cruzi by elicitation of a mixed ( type 1/type 2 ) antibody, T cell and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. TcVac2-induced activation of type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute T. cruzi infection, and consequently, prevented the evolution of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts.
Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have been successful in identifying disease susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases, including type 1 diabetes ( T1D ). However, a remaining question is whether we can quantify individual disease risk based on genotype data to facilitate personalized prevention and treatment for complex diseases. We propose that sophisticated machine-learning approaches with a large ensemble of markers may improve the performance of disease risk assessment. We applied a Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) algorithm on a GWAS dataset generated on the Affymetrix genotyping platform for T1D and optimized a risk assessment model with hundreds of markers. We tested this model on two independent datasets, one genotyped on the Illumina platform and the other on the Affymetrix platform, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) of ∼0. 84 in both datasets. In contrast, poor performance was achieved when limited to dozens of known susceptibility loci in the SVM model or logistic regression model. Our study suggests that improved disease risk assessment can be achieved by using algorithms that take into account interactions between a large ensemble of markers.
Central memory ( TCM ) CD8+ T cells are a subset of memory T cells that rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues, such as the skin, to provide protective immunity against viral infections. However, the subsequent fate of TCM CD8+ T cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues is largely unknown. Here, we show that in contrast to naïve CD8+ T cells, TCM CD8+ T cells traffic into the skin independent of CD62L-mediated lymph node re-activation and provide robust protective immunity against Vaccinia virus ( VacV ) infection. TCM, but not effector memory ( TEM ), CD8+ T cells differentiated into functional CD69+/CD103- tissue residents following viral clearance, which was dependent on local recognition of antigen in the skin microenvironment. We also found that memory CD8+ T cells expressed granzyme B after trafficking into the skin and utilized cytolysis to provide protective immunity against VacV infection. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that TCM CD8+ T cells become cytolytic following rapid infiltration of the skin to protect against viral infection and subsequently differentiate into functional CD69+ tissue-residents.
Myosin VI, a minus-end-directed motor, plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons in neurons. We show that engineering non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myosin VI causes them to become highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat cortical neurons. Furthermore, disruption of either Myosin VI function or expression leads to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myosin VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface at least in part by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that has been shown to underlie the localization of many axonal proteins. In addition, a version of Channelrhodopsin 2 that was engineered to bind to Myosin VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, suggesting that it could be a useful tool for probing circuit structure and function. Together, our results indicate that myosins help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins.
Daphnia magna, a freshwater branchiopod crustacean, exhibits environmental sex determination ( ESD ), where parthenogenetic females produce males in response to environmental cues. We report the identification of two Doublesex ( Dsx ) genes, DapmaDsx1 and DapmaDsx2, in D. magna. DapmaDsx1 is responsible for male trait development when expressed during ESD. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 is similar to that of Dsx from insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 is different from that of insects. DapmaDsx1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in the abundance of its transcripts, which are primarily detected in male-specific structures during embryogenesis. Knock-down of DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits, whereas ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos resulted in the development of male-like phenotypes. These results establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. Our findings reveal how ESD is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using genetic sex determination ( GSD ).
Herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) is a major cause of genital herpes, a sexually transmitted infection that can lead to pain, neonatal herpes, and an increased risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. We evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a trivalent HSV-2 subunit antigen vaccine in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs. The vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E ( gC2, gD2, gE2 ) to block virus entry by gD2 and immune evasion by gC2 and gE2. In rhesus macaques, the trivalent vaccine induced plasma and mucosa neutralizing antibodies, antibodies that block gC2 and gE2 immune evasion activities, and stimulated CD4 T cell responses. After intravaginal challenge, a self-limited vaginal infection of brief duration was detected in naïve, but not in trivalent immunized macaques. In guinea pigs, the trivalent and trivalent + gD2 groups were 97% and 99% efficacious, respectively, in preventing genital lesions and both outperformed gD2 alone. Shedding of replication competent virus occurred on fewer days in the trivalent than gD2 immunized animals, while the trivalent + gD2 group had no shedding of replication competent virus. Overall, the trivalent group had genital lesions on < 1% days and shedding of replication competent virus on 0. 2% days.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) is a high throughput assay for profiling transcription factor ( TF ) binding and histone modifications. ChIP-seq experiments generate millions of short reads ( 50–100 bps ) that are typically mapped to a reference genome. However, reads from highly repetitive regions of the genome, such as segmental duplications, are difficult to map since they can map to multiple locations. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads or are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genome with high accuracy. Perm-seq capitalizes on DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq data and read counts of local neighbourhoods of mapping locations to discriminate between multiple alignment positions of the same read. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.
Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection affecting 218 million people worldwide, has been associated with increased susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and impaired ability to control HIV-1 replication. We conducted a nested case-control study within a large population-based survey of HIV-1 transmission in Tanzania to determine whether schistosome infection affects susceptibility to HIV-1 acquisition and HIV-1 viral load at the time of HIV-1 seroconversion. Approximately 40% of the population had Schistosoma mansoni infection, and 2% had S. haematobium infection. We tested for schistosome antigens in the pre- and post-HIV-1-seroconversion blood spots of 73 HIV-1 seroconverters and 265 matched controls who did not acquire HIV-1. We found that women with schistosome infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without ( adjusted OR = 2. 8 [1. 2–6. 6], p = 0. 019 ). In contrast, schistosome-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition ( adjusted OR = 0. 7 [0. 3–1. 8], p = 0. 42 ). We also found that HIV-1 seroconverters with schistosomiasis had higher HIV-1 viral loads at the time of seroconversion than those without schistosomiasis ( 4. 4 [3. 9–4. 6] log10 copies/mL versus 3. 7 [3. 2–4. 3], p = 0. 017 ).
Ribosomal DNA ( rDNA ) is one of the most variable regions in the human genome with respect to copy number. Despite its importance for cellular function, virtually nothing is known about what governs rDNA copy number, stability, and sequence in the mammalian genome. We applied computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. We find that copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Counterintuitively, human cancer genomes show a loss of copies, accompanied by global copy number co-variation. The sequence can also be more variable in the cancer genome. Cancer genomes with lower copies have mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity. The PTEN phosphatase is a tumor suppressor that is critical for genome stability and a negative regulator of the mTOR kinase pathway. Consistent with human cancer genomes, hematopoietic cancer stem cells from a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia have lower rDNA copy number than normal tissue, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and protein synthesis. Loss of copies occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. Therefore, copy loss is a recurrent feature in cancers associated with mTOR activation.
Bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts are complex processes that cannot be fully understood by studying a single bacterial population. Here, we report on the application of sophisticated experimental approaches to map spatiotemporal population dynamics of bacteria during an infection. We analyzed simultaneous infections with tagged Salmonella enterica populations ( wild-type isogenic tagged strains [WITS] ) in wild-type and gene-targeted mice. WITS are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished and enumerated by quantitative PCR, making it possible to estimate bacterial death rate based on the disappearance of strains through time. This multidisciplinary approach allowed us to establish the timing, relative occurrence, and immune control of key infection parameters in a true host–pathogen combination. Our analyses support a model in which shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid bacterial replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs, a process controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased microbial mortality leads to an exponential increase in the number of bacteria that spread locally, with subsequent mixing of bacteria between organs via bacteraemia and further stochastic selection. This approach provides an unprecedented outlook on the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive an infectious disease.
Binocular 3D motion perception is an ill-posed inverse problem, and existing processing schemes such as interocular velocity difference ( IOVD ), changing disparity over time ( CDOT ), and joint encoding of motion and disparity ( JEMD ) do not provide a general solution. Instead, we suggest that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem, we derive predictions from two plausible default strategies: ( 1 ) the vector normal prefers slow motion in 3D and ( 2 ) the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in 2D. Predicting perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion provides an opportunity to distinguish between these strategies of 3D motion processing. Our theoretical results suggest that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are needed to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. We propose that motion and disparity input are processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the O-acetylated exopolysaccharide alginate to form a protective biofilm matrix during chronic infection in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. The O-acetylation of alginate is a common modification used by pathogenic organisms to protect against external forces. Four proteins have been implicated in the O-acetylation of alginate: AlgF, AlgI, AlgJ, and AlgX. We determined the structure of AlgJ to 1. 83 Å resolution and found that it is a SGNH hydrolase-like protein with a conserved catalytic triad composed of D190, H192, and S288. We demonstrated that AlgJ exhibits acetylesterase activity in vitro and identified residues in the AlgJ signature motifs that form an extensive network of interactions critical for O-acetylation of alginate in vivo. We compared the abilities of AlgJ and AlgX to bind and acetylate alginate using two different electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ( ESI-MS ) assays. We found that AlgJ exhibits either weak or no detectable polymer binding while AlgX binds polymannuronic acid specifically in a length-dependent manner. Additionally, AlgX was capable of utilizing the surrogate acetyl-donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze the O-acetylation of polymannuronic acid. Our results suggest that AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation and place AlgX as the terminal acetyltransferase in the alginate acetylation pathway.
Candida albicans is one of the most common causes of fungal infections in humans and is responsible for a significant number of deaths. This pathogen is able to evade detection by the innate immune system by masking its cell wall component β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan with an outer layer of heavily glycosylated mannoproteins. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to the exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan, which can be detected by innate immune cells through receptors such as Dectin-1. Previous studies have shown that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ( PS ) plays a role in β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan masking, and a PS synthase knockout mutant ( cho1Δ/Δ ) exhibits increased exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan. In this study, we investigated the role of the Cek1 MAPK pathway in β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure. We found that Cek1 is constitutively activated in the cho1Δ/Δ mutant and acts downstream of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho1. We also found that hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells increases β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure and activation of both Cek1 and Mkc1. Furthermore, hyperactivation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 in wild-type cells leads to Cek1 activation and increased β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure. These results suggest that upregulation of the Cek1 MAPK pathway causes β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure and may be responsible for unmasking in the cho1Δ/Δ mutant.
Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) and related dementias are a major public health challenge for which we need additional insight into molecular pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4, 914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD ( neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs ), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy ( CAA ), Lewy body disease ( LBD ), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly ( HS ), and vascular brain injury ( VBI ). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene ( APOE ). We also discovered new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features and aligned known genetic risk for AD dementia with specific neuropathologic changes in the largest brain autopsy study of AD and related dementias.
Urea is a protein denaturant that has been used for decades in the study of protein folding/unfolding; however, after many years of research the ultimate reasons of the denaturing properties of urea remain elusive. By analyzing a set of 30 proteins through extensive molecular dynamics simulations in denaturant, we derived robust rules for urea unfolding that are valid at the proteome level. Urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins, but with a density lower than that of the fully unfolded state. The presence of urea does not alter the spontaneous vibration pattern of proteins. Instead, it reduces the magnitude of such vibrations, leading to a counterintuitive slow down of the atomic-motions that opposes unfolding. Urea stickiness and slow diffusion is crucial for unfolding. Long residence urea molecules placed around the hydrophobic core are crucial to stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Our simulations indicate that although urea does not favor the formation of partially open microstates, it is not a mere spectator of unfolding that simply displaces to the right of the folded←→unfolded equilibrium. On the contrary, urea actively favors unfolding: it selects and stabilizes partially unfolded microstates, slowly driving the protein conformational ensemble far from the native one and also from the conformations sampled during thermal unfolding.
Dengue disease is a major public health priority in Colombia, and a systematic literature review was conducted to describe the epidemiology of the disease in the country between 2000 and 2011. The review included 30 studies published in English or Spanish that met the inclusion criteria. The epidemiology of dengue disease in Colombia was characterized by a stable “baseline” annual number of dengue fever cases, with major outbreaks in 2001–2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of dengue disease cases showed a steady increase, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue disease cases recorded during the review period were among those <15 years of age. The incidence of dengue disease was generally low in south and south-east Colombia, which has the lowest population density in the country. There was an apparent increase during the review period in the geographical area from which dengue disease cases were reported, with a 90% increase in the number of municipalities between 2000 and 2010. The review highlights the record number of cases of non-severe dengue disease reported for 2010 in Colombia. Gaps in epidemiological knowledge regarding dengue disease in Colombia were identified, including rates of asymptomatic dengue virus infection, primary and secondary dengue virus infections, risk factors for severity, and under-reporting of dengue disease.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis ( TL ) is a disease of the skin and/or mucosal tissues caused by Leishmania parasites. TL patients may concurrently carry other pathogens, which may influence the clinical outcome of TL. This review focuses on the frequency of TL coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal models and human subjects, and implications of TL coinfections for clinical practice. We searched MEDLINE and other databases and included 73 records: 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies about human subjects. Several reports describe the frequency of Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina ( about 41% ) and the frequency of helminthiasis in TL patients in Brazil ( 15% to 88% ). Different hypotheses have been explored about mechanisms of interaction between different microorganisms, but no clear answers emerge. Such interactions may involve innate immunity coupled with regulatory networks that affect quality and quantity of acquired immune responses.
Natural polymorphisms in the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 ( Tap2 ) gene in the rat major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) influence negative selection and CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment. We mapped Quantitative Trait Loci ( QTLs ) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4∶CD8 T cell ratio in outbred Heterogeneous Stock rats. We identified 10 QTLs across the genome and found that QTLs for the individual traits colocalized within a region spanning the MHC. We then generated a large panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains and refined the QTLs to two adjacent intervals of ∼0. 25 Mb in the MHC-I and II regions, respectively. An interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression as well as negative selection and lineage commitment of CD8 single-positive ( SP ) thymocytes. We mapped this effect to the Tap2 gene in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene ( s ) ( RT1-A ) in the MHC-I region. This interaction was revealed by a recombination between RT1-A and Tap2, which occurred in 0. 2% of the rats. Variants of Tap2 have previously been shown to influence the antigenicity of MHC class I molecules by altering the MHC class I ligandome. Our results show that a restricted peptide repertoire on MHC class I molecules leads to reduced negative selection of CD8SP cells.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major public health concern in Latin America. In Europe, Spain is the country with the highest expected number of infected patients due to its large number of migrants from Latin America. We analyzed the Spanish National Health System’s Hospital Discharge Records Database ( CMBD ) to describe the evolution of Chagas disease in Spain from 1997 to 2011. We identified 1729 hospitalizations related to Chagas disease, of which 31. 6% were re-admissions. Hospitalization rates increased from 18 to 242. 8 per 100, 000 population between the two study periods ( 1997–2004 and 2005–2011 ). The majority of hospitalizations ( 75. 3% ) were related to Chagas disease without organ complications, while 23. 4% were related to Chagas disease with organ complications, mostly due to heart complications ( 81. 7% ). We found that being male, aged 45–64 years, and having a hospitalization cost above the median ( 3, 065 euros ) were associated with hospitalizations related to Chagas disease with organ complications. The number of detected infections increased in Spain since 2005, and the majority of patients were asymptomatic women of fertile age.
Psoriasis is a complex disease that has been associated with hundreds of genetic markers; however, the “missing heritability” of the disease remains elusive. We present BlocBuster, a novel systems-level approach that efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks that accurately segregate homogenous combinations of genetic factors, tests the associations of these combinations with the given phenotype, and rigorously validates the results using a series of unbiased validation methods. We applied BlocBuster to analyze psoriasis, discovering a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio of 3. 64 and Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5. 01×10−16. This pattern was replicated in independent data, reflecting the robustness of the method. BlocBuster identified a bloc of SNP alleles that is significantly associated with psoriasis and improves upon previous results by supplying a precise allelic pattern within the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ). The associated bloc lies within an exceptionally diverse genomic region and the occurrence of 17 SNP alleles in a single pattern with strong psoriatic association provides precise information for focusing future investigations. Our network-based result is advantageous over the results from conventional genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ).
Agenesis of the corpus callosum ( ACC ), cerebellar hypoplasia ( CBLH ), and polymicrogyria ( PMG ) are severe congenital brain malformations with largely undiscovered causes. We conducted a large-scale chromosomal copy number variation ( CNV ) discovery effort in 255 ACC, 220 CBLH, and 147 PMG patients, and 2, 349 controls. We found that significantly more ACC patients had rare genic CNVs over one megabase compared to controls ( p = 1. 48×10−3; odds ratio [OR] = 3. 19; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1. 89–5. 39 ). Rare genic CNVs were those that impacted at least one gene in less than 1% of the combined population of patients and controls. We also found that significantly more ACC patients had rare CNVs impacting over 20 genes compared to controls ( p = 0. 01; OR = 2. 95; 95% CI = 1. 69–5. 18 ). Independent qPCR confirmation showed that 9. 4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which preferentially overlapped de novo CNVs previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders ( p = 3. 06×10−4; OR = 7. 55; 95% CI = 2. 40–23. 72 ).
Regeneration is a complex process that requires the precise integration of multiple cues to initiate proliferation, direct differentiation, and re-pattern tissues to the proper size and scale. Here, we show that the effector of the Hippo signalling cascade, Yorkie ( Yki ), plays a key role in restricting early injury responses in the freshwater planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea. In Yki RNAi regenerating animals, wound responses are hyper-activated such that both stem cell proliferation and the transcriptional wound response program are heightened and prolonged. We also show that Yki RNAi animals have expanded epidermal and muscle cell populations, which we hypothesize are the increased sources of wound-induced genes. Furthermore, we show that in Yki RNAi animals, the sensing of the size of an injury by eyes or the pharynx is not appropriate, and the brain, gut, and midline cannot remodel or scale correctly to the size of the regenerating fragment. Our results suggest that Yki functions as a key molecule that can integrate multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning.
EV71 infection results in the upregulation of exosome secretion and the differential packaging of viral genomic RNA and miR-146a, a cellular miRNA that suppresses type I interferon response. We found that miR-146a is preferentially co-packaged with EV71 genomic RNA in exosomes and that exosomal miR-146a can be transferred to and suppress type I interferon expression in the recipient cell, thus facilitating the viral replication. The exosomal viral RNA can be transferred to and replicate in a new target cell while the exosomal miR-146a suppresses type I interferon response in the target cell. Moreover, we found that the IFN-stimulated gene factors ( ISGs ), BST-2/tetherin, are involved in regulating EV71-induced upregulation of exosome secretion. In vivo, exosomal viral RNA exhibits differential tissue accumulation compared to free virus particles.
Parkinson's disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in several genes, including PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and Parkin. PINK1 is a serine/threonine kinase with a predicted mitochondrial target sequence and a probable transmembrane domain at the N-terminus, while Parkin is a RING-finger protein with ubiquitin-ligase ( E3 ) activity. PINK1 is required for mitochondrial homeostasis, and mutations in PINK1 cause early-onset PD. Parkin has been suggested to function downstream of the PINK1 signalling pathway based on genetic studies in Drosophila. However, how PINK1 and Parkin regulate mitochondrial activity is largely unknown. Here, we report that a PINK1-binding mitochondrial protein, phosphoglycerate mutase 5 ( PGAM5 ), modulates the PINK1 pathway in Drosophila. Loss of PGAM5 can suppress the muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan that result from PINK1 inactivation and that can be attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, PGAM5 inactivation fails to modulate the phenotypes of Parkin mutant flies. Conversely, ectopic expression of PGAM5 exacerbated the PINK1 and Parkin phenotypes. These results suggest that PGAM5 negatively regulates the PINK1 pathway related to maintenance of the mitochondria and that PGAM5 acts between PINK1 and Parkin, or functions independently of Parkin downstream of PINK1.
Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer ( BU ), a chronic necrotizing human skin disease associated with the production of the cytotoxic macrolide exotoxin mycolactone. Despite extensive research, the type of immune responses elicited against this pathogen and the effector functions conferring protection against BU are not yet fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of interferon-γ ( IFNγ ) in early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infection using an experimental BU mouse model. We found that IFNγ is a critical regulator of early host immune defense against M. ulcerans infections. IFNγ knockout mice displayed a faster progression of the infection compared to wild-type mice, with faster and more extensive tissue necrosis and oedema formation, as well as a significantly higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that mice lacking IFNγ have a reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early intra-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcerans. Our results demonstrate a prominent role of IFNγ in early defense against M. ulcerans infection and support the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may also be valid for BU.
Reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production in mitochondria is a major cause of systemic diseases. However, the mechanism of hypoxia-induced change in ROS production is not fully understood. We developed a new methodology to mathematically analyze this mechanism by constructing a system of differential equations to model electron transport in mitochondria. This approach allowed us to identify two steady state modes of operation ( bistability ) of respiratory complex III at the same microenvironmental conditions. Normally, complex III is in a low ROS producing mode, but temporal anoxia can switch it to a high ROS producing state, which persists after the return to normal oxygen supply. This bistability explains the mechanism of anoxia-induced cell damage. We qualitatively validated this prediction experimentally and found that anoxia can induce a significant increase in ROS production upon the resumption of oxygen supply. Our method of modeling can be widely used in systems biology studies and may enable novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress.
The terminal gap gene huckebein ( hkb ) plays a crucial role in the patterning system of Drosophila melanogaster. Gap genes constitute the first zygotic step in a regulatory cascade that leads to the determination of body segments along the anterior-posterior body axis during the blastoderm stage. Here, we use an integrative, systems-level approach to investigate the regulatory effect of hkb on gap gene expression. We present quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein, which enable us to include hkb in gap gene circuit models. These models are mathematical representations of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from spatial expression data. We show that considering variability in the data combined with analysis of parameter determinability significantly improves the biological relevance and consistency of the approach. Our models are in agreement with earlier results and extend them in two important respects. First, we show that hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunchback ( hb ) domain, but does not have any other essential function. Second, our models are able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, while previously published models were unable to reproduce any null mutants correctly. As a consequence, our models now capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly.
Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide. Currently, there is no effective immunotherapy for Brucellosis or a biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy. We report here the successful immunotherapy of bovine Brucellosis by phage lysates of Brucella abortus vaccine strains S19 and RB51. Phage lysates retain maximum immunogenicity as opposed to killing by heat or chemicals. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of phage lysates of S19 and RB51 in Brucellosis in adult cattle and employed Brucella specific RNA in plasma as a biomarker to monitor the effect of therapy in the live animal in a non-destructive and minimally invasive manner. The immunotherapeutic agents ( phage lysates of Brucella abortus strain 19 and RB51 ) were injected only once in the Brucellosis affected cattle at a dose of 2 ml subcutaneously. Trials of phage lysate therapy were carried out on 21 naturally Brucellosis affected adult cows. The Brucellosis positive adult cows were divided into four groups: Group I animals ( n = 6 ) were immunized with Brucella abortus S19 lysate only, Group II animals ( n = 5 ) were immunized with Brucella abortus RB51 lysate only, Group III animals ( n = 5 ) were immunized with cocktail of S19 and RB51 lysates, and Group IV animals ( n = 5 ) were not immunized. A single dose of 2 ml of phage lysate of Brucella abortus attenuated strain RB51 alone or in combination with lysate of Brucella abortus attenuated strain S19 administered subcutaneously in naturally Brucellosis infected adult cows successfully eliminated virulent Brucella abortus from the infected cattle in 3 months.
Here we show that Cdk2 plays a specific role in orchestrating the DNA damage response in human cells. By replacing wild-type Cdk2 with a mutant version sensitized to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs, we found that transient, selective inhibition of Cdk2 after exposure to ionizing radiation ( IR ) enhances cell-killing. This indicates that Cdk2 activity is required for an effective DNA damage response. We also show that Cdk2 phosphorylates the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome gene product Nbs1, a component of the conserved Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex required for normal DNA damage repair and checkpoint signaling. This phosphorylation is dependent on a consensus CDK recognition site at Ser432 of Nbs1. In vivo, selective inhibition of Cdk2 delayed and diminished Nbs1-Ser432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR–sensitivity. Therefore, we have uncovered a non-redundant requirement for Cdk2 activity in response to DNA damage and a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery.
Genome-wide association ( GWA ) studies have identified many genetic loci associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits, but the functional mechanisms underlying these associations are not well understood. We applied the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements ( FAIRE ) method to map open chromatin in a megakaryocytic and an erythroblastoid cell line at 62 genetic loci associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits. We found that the two cell types exhibit distinct patterns of open chromatin and that cell-specific open chromatin can guide the finding of functional variants. We identified an open chromatin region at chromosome 7q22. 3 in megakaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors the common non-coding sequence variant rs342293 known to be associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing of this open chromatin region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342293 is the only putative causative variant in this region. We demonstrated that the C- and G-alleles of rs342293 differentially bind the transcription factor EVI1, affecting PIK3CG gene expression in platelets and macrophages. We also identified a protein–protein interaction network including up- and down-regulated genes in Pik3cg knockout mice, indicating that PIK3CG is associated with gene pathways involved in platelet membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation.
Respiratory rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex ( pre-BötC ) has been proposed to be dependent on a persistent sodium current ( INaP ). However, the effects of pharmacological blockade of INaP have been difficult to interpret due to the lack of understanding of the mechanisms of action of commonly used blockers. Using computer simulations, we demonstrate that the effects of INaP blockade by tetrodotoxin ( TTX ) and riluzole ( RZ ) depend on the pharmacological mechanism of action and network dynamics. TTX directly obstructs the Na+ pore, whereas RZ shifts INaP inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. We show that RZ may fail to effectively block INaP in the intact network due to the specific pharmacological mechanism of action and transient inhibitory network interactions, and that pre-I bursting in the intact network is likely dependent on both inhibitory network interactions and INaP. Importantly, we predict that experimental TTX application in the intact network will terminate respiratory rhythmicity. Our results provide a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block and illustrate the importance of considering mechanism when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade.
Gastric cancer ( GC ) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-218 in the regulation of GC metastasis. We found that miR-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC and that its host gene, Slit3, is also downregulated. However, miR-218 negatively regulates Robo1, one of the Slit receptors, thus establishing a negative feedback loop. When miR-218 levels are low, Robo1 is upregulated, leading to the activation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway through the interaction between Robo1 and Slit2. This results in the promotion of tumor cell invasion and metastasis. In contrast, the restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Our results provide new insights into the metastatic mechanisms in GC and reveal a novel regulatory mechanism of receptor signaling.
Atherosclerosis is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease and stroke. Despite the effectiveness of plasma lipid lowering regimes in halting atherosclerosis lesion development and reducing morbidity and mortality, the transcriptional response in the atherosclerotic lesion mediating these beneficial effects has not yet been carefully investigated. We performed transcriptional profiling at 10-week intervals in atherosclerosis-prone mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia and a genetic switch to lower plasma lipoproteins ( Ldlr−/−Apo100/100 Mttpflox/flox Mx1-Cre ). Atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then expanded rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of lesion expression profiles indicated that accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages reached a point that led to the rapid expansion phase with accelerated foam-cell formation and inflammation. Genetic lowering of plasma cholesterol prevented the formation of advanced plaques and parallel transcriptional profiling of the atherosclerotic arterial wall identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages incubated with acetylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation. We have identified a network of atherosclerosis genes that in response to plasma cholesterol-lowering prevents the formation of advanced plaques. This network should be of interest for the development of novel atherosclerosis therapies.
The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria is a formidable barrier that is difficult for antimicrobial drugs to penetrate. To combat this, a detailed mechanistic understanding of envelope assembly is required. We developed a simple, quantitative, and high-throughput assay for mutants with envelope biogenesis defects and used it to screen an ordered single-gene deletion library of Escherichia coli. The screen was robust and correctly identified numerous mutants known to be involved in envelope assembly and implicated 102 genes of unknown function as encoding factors that likely impact envelope biogenesis. One of these factors, ElyC ( YcbC ), was characterized further and shown to play a critical role in the metabolism of the essential lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides. Further analysis of the function of ElyC and other hits identified in our screen is likely to uncover a wealth of new information about the biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and the vulnerabilities in the system suitable for drug targeting. The screening assay described here should be readily adaptable to other organisms to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures.
Multivariable dynamics in biological systems, such as pattern formation in Drosophila, can be studied using a variety of techniques, each of which captures unique features of the system. However, the integration of heterogeneous datasets into an integrated view of multivariable dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate that heterogeneous data fusion can be successfully implemented within a semi-supervised learning framework that exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets. We illustrate our approach using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals the joint dynamics of gene expression, subcellular protein localization, protein phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. Our approach can be readily adapted to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further steps of data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics. By posing the task of data fusion as a semi-supervised learning problem, we obtained a closed-form expression for the estimated values of all variables using harmonic extension. The reconstructed trajectories provide the basis for the more advanced mechanistic studies of multivariable processes responsible for the highly reproducible dynamics of developmental pattern formation.
Snake venom hemorrhagic metalloproteinases ( SVMPs ) of the PI, PII and PIII classes were compared in terms of tissue localization and their ability to hydrolyze basement membrane components in vivo. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that PII and PIII SVMPs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles and post-capillary venules to a higher extent than PI SVMP, which showed a more widespread distribution in the tissue. The patterns of hydrolysis by these three SVMPs of laminin, type VI collagen and nidogen in vivo greatly differ, whereas the three enzymes showed a similar pattern of degradation of type IV collagen. This supports the concept that hydrolysis of type IV collagen is critical for the destabilization of microvessel structure leading to hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of wound exudate revealed similarities and differences between the action of the three SVMPs. Higher extent of proteolysis was observed for the PI enzyme regarding several extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, whereas exudates from mice injected with PII and PIII SVMPs had higher amounts of some intracellular proteins. Our results provide novel clues for understanding the mechanisms by which SVMPs induce damage to the microvasculature and generate hemorrhage.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the expression of the homeotic gene abd-A is repressed by the noncoding RNA iab-8 in the epidermis of the eighth abdominal segment, but not in the central nervous system. The iab-8 RNA produces a micro RNA that acts in trans to repress abd-A, as well as a second, redundant repression mechanism that acts only in cis. Transcriptional interference with the abd-A promoter is the most likely mechanism of this cis-repression. The iab-8 RNA interferes with an abd-A enhancer that lies downstream of the iab-4186 breakpoint, and the major poly ( A ) site of the iab-8 RNA lies only 1. 1 kb upstream of the initiation site of abd-A. The primary transcript of the iab-8 RNA likely continues past its poly ( A ) addition site. The iab-8 RNA can only repress the copy of abd-A on the chromosome from which it is transcribed, as shown by the lack of ABD-A misexpression in the CNS of PS13 embryos homozygous for the ΔmiR-iab-8 deletion over DfP9. Thus, there are two mechanisms by which the iab-8 RNA represses abd-A. Rearrangement breaks that truncate the iab-8 RNA near its start site cause a dramatic derepression of abd-A in the CNS of the 8th abdominal segment, indistinguishable from that seen in Df ( 3R ) C4 homozygotes.
Focal seizures are episodes of pathological brain activity that appear to arise from a localised area of the brain and have been distinguished into two types: low amplitude fast oscillations ( LAF ) and high amplitude spikes ( HAS ). Using a previously established computational model of neocortical tissue, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the different onset patterns of focal seizures. We validated the model using clinical recordings of focal seizures and reproduced the two onset patterns in their most defining properties. We found that LAF onset is initiated by independent patches of localised activity that slowly invade the surrounding tissue and coalesce over time. In contrast, HAS onset is a global, systemic transition to a coexisting seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of the “healthy” surrounding tissue, which by itself does not generate seizures, but can support seizure activity when incited. We also found that the difference in surrounding tissue excitability offers a simple explanation of the clinically reported difference in surgical outcomes.
Defensin-like cysteine-rich proteins, ZmES1-4, are secreted by the female gametophyte in maize and play a role in pollen tube growth arrest, burst, and explosive sperm release. ZmES1-4 are exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte and accumulate in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells. Upon pollen tube arrival, vesicles containing ZmES4 are released and induce pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner. We found that ZmES4 interacts with the potassium channel KZM1, converting it from a voltage-dependent inward rectifier to a voltage-independent, non-rectifying channel. This results in potassium influx into the pollen tube, leading to water uptake and osmotic tube burst.
HER-2-retargeted oncolytic herpes simplex virus ( R-LM249 ) has been developed to specifically infect and kill tumor cells expressing high levels of HER-2 oncoprotein, which is overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers. We evaluated the efficacy of i. p. administered R-LM249 against disseminated HER-2+ ovarian and breast carcinomas in mouse models that recapitulate tumor spread to the peritoneum in women. R-LM249 strongly inhibited carcinomatosis, resulting in 60% of mice free from peritoneal diffusion, and 95% reduction in the total weight of neoplastic nodules. The virus effectively reduced the growth of ovarian and breast carcinoma disseminated to the peritoneal cavity. R-LM249 also inhibited the growth of ovarian metastases of HER-2+ MDA-MB-453 breast cells and reduced brain metastases. Notably, R-LM249 is effective against HER-2+ trastuzumab-resistant cells, an important property in view of clinical application. The ability of R-LM249 to infect only cells with a high level of HER-2 cell surface expression suggests that the virus is unlikely to infect cells with low level of HER-2, i. e. non cancer cells in which the gene is not amplified. Overall, the i. p. -administered R-LM249 exerted a strong antimetastatic effect against peritoneal metastases of breast cancers and some evidence of therapeutic effect on extraperitoneal metastases was also found.
In eukaryotic cells, centrosomes serve as the poles of the mitotic spindle and are essential for bipolar spindle formation and proper chromosome segregation. However, aberrant centrosome numbers are linked to chromosomal instability and are commonly observed in cancers. Our study identifies Sfi1, a conserved component of centrosomes, as the first cyclin-dependent kinase ( Cdk ) substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. We found that reducing Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 by changing its phosphorylation sites to nonphosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies ( SPBs, yeast centrosomes ) and to inappropriate SPB reduplication during mitosis. In addition, these cells display defects in bipolar spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. We propose that Cdk1 phosphorylation of Sfi1 is required for SPB separation and a block to SPB reduplication. After SPB duplication is complete, Cdk1 phosphorylates at least four Sfi1 C-terminal residues, allowing for SPB separation and bipolar spindle formation during mitosis. These residues remain phosphorylated during mitosis, restricting licensing of SPB duplication until downregulation of mitotic cyclin/Cdk1 at the end of mitosis. Dephosphorylation of Sfi1 by Cdc14 at the end of mitosis then licenses the SPBs for the next cycle of G1 SPB duplication.
In this study, we investigated the role of viral protein R ( Vpr ) in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS. Using a human hematopoietic stem cell-transplanted humanized mouse model, we demonstrated that Vpr causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis predominantly in proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells, which mainly consist of regulatory CD4+ T cells ( Tregs ), resulting in Treg depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. This effect is observed in CCR5-tropic but not CXCR4-tropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting that these effects are dependent on the coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation was observed in CCR5-tropic wild-type but not in vpr-deficient HIV-1-infected humanized mice. Our findings suggest that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating CCR5+ CD4+ T cells for enhancing viremia of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. Because Tregs exist in a higher cycling state than other T cell subsets, Tregs appear to be more vulnerable to exploitation by Vpr during acute HIV-1 infection.
Plasmodium vivax, the parasite responsible for vivax malaria, was eradicated in South Korea in the late 1970s but re-emerged in 1993. To control malaria and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures, it is essential to understand the genetic structure and temporal dynamics of the parasite population. Here, we analyzed microsatellite DNA markers of P. vivax from 163 South Korean isolates collected from 1994 to 2008 to estimate the population structure and temporal dynamics of the parasite. We analyzed 14 microsatellite DNA loci and found a gradual decrease in linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) levels and an increase in genetic diversity from 1994 to 2008. However, a drastic genetic change occurred in the South Korean P. vivax population during 2002 and 2003, as suggested by the levels of genetic differentiation between successive years and the population structure based on the Bayesian approach. Although relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may have influenced the population structure, our results suggest the continual introduction of P. vivax into South Korea through other parasite population sources. One possible source is North Korea, particularly during 2002 and 2003. Molecular epidemiology using microsatellite DNA of the P. vivax population is effective for assessing the population structure and temporal dynamics of parasite transmission, which can assist in the elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas.
The presence of a splicing-competent intron is a conserved feature among eukaryotes that enhances transcription. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not entirely clear. Here we show that the intron is an important regulator of promoter directionality. Employing strand-specific transcription run-on ( TRO ) analysis, we show that the transcription of mRNA is favored over the upstream anti-sense transcripts ( uaRNA ) initiating from the promoter in the presence of an intron. Mutation of either the 5′ or 3′ splice site resulted in the reversal of promoter directionality, suggesting that it is not merely the 5′ splice site but the entire splicing-competent intron that regulates transcription directionality. ChIP analysis revealed the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region in the presence of an intron. Removal of intron or the mutation of splice sites adversely affected the promoter localization of termination factors. We have earlier demonstrated that the intron-mediated enhancement of transcription is dependent on gene looping. Here we show that gene looping is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of an intron-containing gene. In a looping-defective mutant, despite normal splicing, the promoter occupancy of factors required for poly ( A ) -dependent termination of transcription was compromised. This was accompanied by a concomitant loss of transcription directionality.
ZBED6 is a novel transcription factor derived from a domesticated DNA transposon that regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of IGF2 in pigs leads to a 3-fold up-regulation of IGF2 in skeletal muscle, resulting in major effects on muscle growth, size of the heart, and fat deposition. We have identified ZBED6 as the repressor of IGF2 expression and found that it is specific to placental mammals and is derived from an exapted DNA transposon. Silencing of Zbed6 in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affects Igf2 expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing using C2C12 cells identified about 2, 500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, and the deduced consensus motif gave a perfect match with the established binding site in Igf2. Genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites show a highly significant enrichment for certain Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. The phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED6-silenced C2C12 myoblasts, the extreme sequence conservation, its nucleolar localization, the broad tissue distribution, and the many target genes with essential biological functions suggest that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth.
The RNA editome of the rhesus macaque, a close relative of humans, has been accurately and quantitatively profiled for the first time. By combining genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal, we identified 31, 250 editing sites, of which 99. 8% are A-to-G transitions. We verified 96. 6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97. 5% of randomly selected sites in non-coding regions by multiple independent means, demonstrating the feasibility of our experimental paradigm. Our findings support the notion that adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome, as A-to-G editing sites are flanked by sequences with the attributes of ADAR substrates, and both the sequence context and the expression profile of ADARs are relevant factors in determining the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types. Furthermore, we detected a substitution valley of decreased divergence around the editing site, suggesting the evolutionary constraint in maintaining some of these editing substrates with their double-stranded structure. These findings complement the “continuous probing” model that postulates tinkering-based origination of a small proportion of functional editing sites. The macaque editome reported here highlights RNA editing as a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution, and provides an informative framework for further understanding RNA editing in humans.
In a two-alternative spatial frequency discrimination task, we report a new perceptual bias where observers read out the likelihood representation with remarkably low precision when discriminating grating spatial frequencies. We induced an asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequency by using spectrally filtered noise, mainly affecting the likelihood of spatial frequencies that are irrelevant to the task at hand. As a result, we found a significant shift in perceived grating frequency, indicating that observers evaluate likelihoods of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives. We measured grating detectability and discriminability in the presence of filtered visual noise and found that filtered noise backgrounds dramatically alter the perception of grating spatial frequency. Embedding a grating in low-pass filtered noise causes the perceived spatial frequency of the grating to decrease, while high-pass filtered noise increases perceived grating spatial frequency. Our results suggest that observers consider the log likelihood values of spatial frequencies that are a-priori unlikely to occur during the tasks, which lowers grating detectability and leads to a bias in perceived spatial frequency.
Piwi-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ) are a class of small RNAs that play a conserved role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements in many organisms. In Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that each piRNA represents a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit that requires only a 21 nucleotide ( nt ) piRNA sequence and an ∼50 nt upstream motif with limited genomic context for expression. We demonstrate that this upstream motif is necessary for independent expression of a germline-enriched, Piwi-dependent piRNA, and that a single nucleotide position within this motif directs differential germline enrichment. We further show that over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germline, and that these two populations have evolved independently. Our results indicate that C. elegans piRNA upstream motifs act as independent promoters to specify which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in what germline. We also show that the 5′ nucleotide of the conserved core motif influences germline enrichment of the dependent 21U RNA species. Finally, we demonstrate that the clustered organization of endogenous piRNA loci is entirely dispensable for robust piRNA expression, and that each 21U RNA locus encodes all of the information necessary for driving independent, autonomous transcription from more than 15, 000 unique piRNA loci in C. elegans.
Brucella abortus replicates within host cells in the form of endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) -derived vacuoles. The mechanisms by which the bacteria acquire the ER-derived membrane for their replication remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that the IRE1 pathway, but not the PERK and ATF6 pathways, of the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) is activated in a time-dependent manner during Brucella infection, and that the COPII vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D are upregulated. We also show that a marked accretion of ER-derived vacuoles is observed around replicating bacteria using fluorescent microscopy and electron microscopy. Furthermore, we identify a novel host factor, Yip1A, for the activation of the IRE1 pathway in response to both tunicamycin treatment and infection with B. abortus. Yip1A is responsible for the phosphorylation of IRE1 through high-order assembly of Ire1 molecules at ER exit sites ( ERES ) under the UPR conditions. In Yip1A-knockdown cells, B. abortus fails to generate the ER-derived vacuoles, and remains in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. These results indicate that the activation of the IRE1 pathway and the subsequent formation of ER-derived vacuoles are critical for B. abortus to establish a safe replication niche, and that Yip1A is indispensable for these processes.
Tomato bushy stunt virus ( TBSV ) and the closely-related carnation Italian ringspot virus ( CIRV ) hijack the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) into the large viral replication compartment. The kinase function of Vps34 is critical for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI ( 3 ) P phosphoinositide is utilized by TBSV for building of the replication compartment. We also observed increased expression of Vps34 and the higher abundance of PI ( 3 ) P in the presence of the tombusviral replication proteins, which likely leads to more efficient tombusvirus replication. Overexpression of PI ( 3 ) P phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibited TBSV replication on the peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on the mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, the purified PI ( 3 ) P phosphatase reduced TBSV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI ( 3 ) P with antibody or a bioprobe revealed the enrichment of PI ( 3 ) P in the replication compartment. Vps34 is directly recruited into the replication compartment through interaction with p33 replication protein. Gene deletion analysis in surrogate yeast host unraveled that TBSV replication requires the vesicle transport function of Vps34. In the absence of Vps34, TBSV cannot efficiently recruit the Rab5-positive early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment. We found that Vps34 and PI ( 3 ) P are needed for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI ( 3 ) P abundance was decreased by an inhibitor of Vps34.
Transmission of dengue virus ( DENV ) from humans to Aedes aegypti mosquitoes is a critical component of dengue epidemiology. However, studies on this process have been hampered by a lack of methods that adequately represent natural acquisition of DENV by mosquitoes from humans. In this study, we assessed artificial and natural blood feeding methods based on rates of DENV infection and dissemination within mosquitoes for use in a field-based epidemiological cohort study in Iquitos, Peru. Between 2011 and 2015, we enrolled 58 participants aged 5 years and older with 5 or fewer days of fever from ongoing clinic- and neighborhood-based studies on dengue in Iquitos. Wild type, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypti were fed directly on febrile individuals or on blood collected from participants that was either untreated or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after approximately 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination. We found that DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-EDTA feeding; however, they were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on blood with no additive. Relative to direct feeding, infection rates showed greater variation following indirect-EDTA than indirect-no additive feeding. No differences were detected in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence.
Topoisomerase II poisons are a class of chemotherapeutic drugs that target the topoisomerase II enzyme, which is essential for relieving topological stress ahead of the replication fork in proliferative cell populations. However, these drugs are differentially effective from one patient to the next, and understanding the causes of this variability is a critical step towards the development of personalized treatments and improvements to existing medications. Using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that wild strains of C. elegans vary in their sensitivity to topoisomerase II poisons, and that this natural variation is explained by a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in the topoisomerase II ( TOP-2 ) enzyme. We demonstrate that the presence of a non-polar methionine at this residue increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and its poison etoposide, resulting in increased genomic instability in strains that contain a methionine residue. This residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms ( methionine in hTOPIIα and glutamine in hTOPIIβ ). We go on to show that this amino acid difference between the two human topoisomerase isoforms influences cytotoxicity of topoisomerase II poisons in human cell lines, demonstrating the utility of C. elegans in understanding the genetics of drug responses.
Long-lived rodents, such as African mole-rats, have life expectancies that are multiple times higher than similar sized and phylogenetically closely related rodents. To gain new insights into genetic mechanisms determining mammalian lifespans, we obtained genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and scanned eleven evolutionary branches associated with the evolution of enhanced longevity for positively selected genes ( PSGs ). We identified 250 PSGs that showed an expression pattern fitting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging in the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats. These PSGs were enriched for genes known to be related to aging, including “cellular respiration” and “metal ion homeostasis”, as well as functional terms associated with processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Among the identified PSGs were RHEB, a regulator of mTOR, and IGF1, both central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as genes yet unknown to be aging-associated but representing convincing functional candidates, e. g. RHEBL1, AMHR2, PSMG1, and AGER.
Aedes albopictus mosquitoes are a major vector of chikungunya, dengue, and zika viruses. To control their populations, the endosymbiont Wolbachia has been exploited to produce sterile males and/or invasive females with reduced vector competence. A new Aedes albopictus transinfection ( ARwP-M ) was generated by introducing wMel Wolbachia in the ARwP line, which had previously been established by replacing wAlbA and wAlbB Wolbachia with the wPip strain. ARwP-M showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of wMel and wPip Wolbachia and did not differ in survival, female fecundity, and egg fertility from ARwP and wild-type Ae. albopictus. Crosses between ARwP-M males and wild-type females were fully unfertile, while egg hatch in reverse crosses increased from 0 to about 17% with wild-type males aging from 3 to 17 days. When competing with wild-type males for wild-type females, ARwP-M males induced a level of sterility significantly higher than that expected for an equal mating competitiveness. The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was about 15 fold higher than in ARwP, mostly due to the wMel infection. This corresponded to a strongly reduced vector competence for chikungunya and dengue viruses, with 5 and 0% rates of transmission at 14 and 21 days post infection, respectively.
Peptide-mediated interactions between proteins play a crucial role in regulating biological responses to intra- and extracellular stimuli. These interactions are characterized by a relatively small contact interface between a globular domain in one protein and a linear peptide from another. Most current methods for discovering such motifs exploit their tendency to occur in disordered regions of proteins. However, our work focuses on the observation that upon binding to their partner domain, motifs adopt a well-defined structure. We analyzed all peptide-mediated interactions of known high-resolution three-dimensional ( 3D ) structure and found that the structure of the peptide may be as characteristic as the consensus motif, helping to identify target peptides even if they do not match established patterns. We implemented a strategy based on a Support Vector Machine that uses structural features of peptides, along with other structure-encoded information about binding interfaces, to search the set of protein interactions of known 3D structure and identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions. We also derived consensus patterns for these interactions and compared them with established linear motif patterns and their binding domains. Finally, we cross-validated our identification strategy by scanning interactome networks from four model organisms and found significant over-representations for 64 domain-motif interactions, 46 of which had not been described before, involving over 6, 000 interactions for which we could suggest the molecular details determining the binding.
Environmental enteropathy ( EE ) is a condition associated with growth failure, micronutrient malabsorption, and impaired responses to oral vaccines. We studied 49 adults with EE in Lusaka, Zambia, using confocal laser endomicroscopy ( CLE ), histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of small intestinal biopsies, and correlated these with plasma lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) and a zinc uptake test. CLE images showed virtually ubiquitous small intestinal damage, and epithelial defects were predominantly seen at the tips of villi, corresponding with leakage imaged in vivo by CLE. Circulating LPS was correlated with cell shedding events ( β = 0. 83; P = 0. 035 ) and with serum glucagon-like peptide-2 ( β = -0. 13; P = 0. 007 ). Zinc uptake from a test dose of 25mg was attenuated in 30/47 ( 64% ) individuals, and in multivariate analysis was reduced by HIV, but positively correlated with GLP-2 ( β = 2. 72; P = 0. 03 ). Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins.
Turnip crinkle virus ( TCV ) is a small icosahedral plant virus with a ( + ) -strand RNA genome that encodes five proteins. Here we demonstrate that superinfection exclusion ( SIE ) of TCV is exclusively determined by p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by this virus. We show that p28 expressed from a TCV replicon exerts strong SIE to a different TCV replicon, and that transiently expressed p28, delivered simultaneously with or ahead of a TCV replicon, largely recapitulates this repressive activity. Interestingly, p28-mediated SIE is dramatically enhanced by C-terminally fused epitope tags or fluorescent proteins, but weakened by N-terminal modifications, and it inversely correlates with the ability of p28 to complement the replication of a p28-defective TCV replicon. We further show that p28 in SIE-positive cells forms large, mobile punctate inclusions that trans-aggregate a non-coalescing, SIE-defective, yet replication-competent p28 mutant. These results support a model postulating that TCV SIE is caused by the formation of multimeric p28 complexes capable of intercepting fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfector genomes, thereby abolishing superinfector replication.
Immunization of mice with a plasmid encoding the Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialidase ( TS ) gene has been shown to be highly immunogenic and provide protection against acute lethal challenge. However, long-term protection induced by TS DNA vaccines has not been reported. In the present study, we tested whether the co-administration of a plasmid encoding IL-15 ( pIL-15 ) could improve the duration of protection achieved through genetic vaccination with plasmid encoding TS ( pTS ) alone. We immunized BALB/c mice with pTS in the presence or absence of pIL-15 and studied immune responses and protection against lethal systemic challenge at 1 to 6 months post-vaccination. Mice receiving pTS alone developed robust TS-specific IFN-γ responses and survived a lethal challenge given within the first 3 months following immunization. The addition of pIL-15 to pTS vaccination did not significantly alter T cell responses or protection during this early post-vaccination period. However, mice vaccinated with both pTS and pIL-15 challenged 6 months post-vaccination were significantly more protected against lethal T. cruzi challenges than mice vaccinated with pTS alone ( P<0. 05 ). Improved protection correlated with significantly higher numbers of TS-specific IFN-γ producing total and CD8+ T cells detected>6 months post immunization.
Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, is a protozoan parasite that undergoes a complex cell division process involving basal body segregation, flagellum attachment and cytokinesis. The Polo-like kinase homolog in T. brucei, TbPLK, plays essential roles in these processes. However, the mechanism controlling TbPLK protein abundance remains unknown. Here, we report that a Cullin4-based ubiquitin ligase complex, CRL4WDR1, mediates TbPLK degradation in the basal body and the bilobe. CRL4WDR1 is composed of Cullin4, the DNA damage-binding protein 1 homolog TbDDB1 and a WD40-repeat protein WDR1. WDR1 acts as a receptor for TbPLK in the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex. We show that depletion of WDR1 impairs TbPLK ubiquitination and degradation, leading to excessive accumulation of TbPLK in the basal body and the bilobe and continuous phosphorylation of the bilobe protein TbCentrin2. This results in defective bilobe duplication, flagellum attachment zone filament assembly and flagellum detachment.
The RNA helicase DDX3X has been identified as an essential mediator of innate antimicrobial immunity. Mice lacking DDX3X in the hematopoietic system show an altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen and are highly susceptible to Listeria monocytogenes ( Lm ) infection. This suggests that DDX3X plays a vital role in innate immunity to Listeria. The sex-specific isoforms of DDX3 contribute to the innate immune response and may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease. Our data provide further in vivo evidence for an essential contribution of a non-RIG-I like receptor ( RLR ) DExD/H RNA helicase to innate immunity. DDX3X regulates the expression of genes contributing to the innate antimicrobial response of macrophages, and the extent to which DDX3X deficiency alters the transcriptome depends on the sex chromosomes of the cells. DDX3X has been identified as a regulator of IFN-I transcription in cells infected with viruses or Listeria monocytogenes. DDX3X belongs to the DEAD-box RNA helicase superfamily 2, which has widespread functions in RNA metabolism, including transcription, RNA processing, splicing, decay, and translation.
A biophysical model of the pheromone transduction cascade in male moth olfactory receptor neurons ( ORNs ) is presented. The model focuses on post-effector processes, including the production and degradation of second messengers ( IP3 and DAG ), the opening and closing of ionic channels ( IP3-gated Ca2+ channel, DAG-gated cationic channel, Ca2+-gated Cl− channel, and Ca2+- and voltage-gated K+ channel ), and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. These processes are regulated by modulators ( protein kinase C and Ca2+-calmodulin ) that exert feedback inhibition on the effector and channels. The model captures the main features of the dose–response curves, including the wide dynamic range of six decades with the same amplitudes as the experimental data, the short rising time, and the long falling time. It also reproduces the second messenger kinetics. The model suggests that the two main types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pheromone concentrations; the DAG-gated cationic channel plays the major role for depolarization at low concentrations, and the Ca2+-gated Cl− channel plays the major role for depolarization at middle and high concentrations.
Cellular stress activates the tumor suppressor protein p53, leading to selective binding to DNA response elements ( REs ) and gene transactivation from a large pool of potential p53 REs ( p53REs ). To elucidate how p53RE sequences and local chromatin context interact to affect p53 binding and gene transactivation, we mapped genome-wide binding localizations of p53 and H3K4me3 in untreated and doxorubicin ( DXR ) -treated human lymphoblastoid cells. We observed that the inducible expression of p53-regulated genes was associated with the steady-state chromatin status of the cell. Most highly inducible p53-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or displayed CTCF binding. Comparison of p53RE sequences residing in different chromatin contexts demonstrated that weaker p53REs resided in open promoters, while stronger p53REs were located within enhancers and repressed chromatin. p53 occupancy was strongly correlated with similarity of the target DNA sequences to the p53RE consensus, but inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility ( DHS ) and evolutionary conservation at the p53RE. Occupancy by p53 of REs that overlapped transposable element ( TE ) repeats was significantly higher and correlated with stronger p53RE sequences relative to nonTE-associated p53REs.
Two-component signaling systems in bacteria offer a rich diversity of sensory systems that can be reengineered through synthetic biology. These systems are built around a core phosphotransfer reaction between histidine kinases and their output response regulator proteins. Here, we explore the signal-response relationship arising from a specific motif found in two-component signaling systems, where a single histidine kinase ( HK ) phosphotransfers reversibly to two separate output response regulator ( RR ) proteins. We show that this motif not only allows rapid signal termination but also implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship. We identify two mathematical conditions on system parameters that are necessary for sigmoidal signal-response relationships and define key parameters that control threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve. We confirm these findings experimentally, by in vitro reconstitution of the one HK-two RR motif found in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway and measuring the resulting signal-response curve. We find that the level of sigmoidality in this system can be experimentally controlled by the presence of the sink RR, and also through an auxiliary protein that is shown to bind to the HK ( yielding Hill coefficients of above 7 ). These findings show that the one HK-two RR motif allows bacteria and yeast to implement tunable switch-like signal processing and provides an ideal basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications.
Single-cell RNA sequencing is used to quantify transcript heterogeneity in individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates that influence the stress-responsive transcriptome. The results reveal significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells appears to decouple expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response in a manner partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the yeast ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing pairs of fluorescent regulators, including the transcription factor Msn2 with Dot6, Sfp1, or MAP kinase Hog1, reveals both coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Together with transcriptomic analysis, our results suggest that cells maintain a cellular filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells.
Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in large numbers in the male reproductive organs of mice, including the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis. Histopathological analysis reveals that the parasites are associated with marked inflammatory cell infiltration, parasite degeneration, and severe tissue damage and rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be related to reduced fertility. In contrast, no parasites are found in the lumen of intact epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the testis, indicating that the majority of parasites are not located in immune-privileged sites. Immunohistochemistry analysis shows that T. brucei is present in the epididymis and epididymal adipose tissue since at least day 6 post-infection, with the epididymis showing a temporal increase in parasite density that attains 105 parasites per mg of organ at late stages of the disease. Overall, we show that T. brucei is exposed to a strong immune response in the male reproductive organs, and that the epididymis and epididymal adipose tissue are major sites of parasite accumulation.
Chemoreceptor genes in Drosophila melanogaster undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Exposure to the odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes, which are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex members. We analyzed covariance in transcript abundance of chemosensory genes across all environmental conditions and found that they segregated into 20 relatively small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated transcripts. This finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory subgenome enables fine tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions.
Meiotic recombination in human oocytes has been linked to the origin of human trisomies. Studies of human trisomies indicate that failure to recombine or recombination events located too near to or too far from the centromere are associated with nondisjunction at maternal meiosis I or II. We initiated studies of crossover-associated proteins ( e. g., MLH1 ) in human fetal oocytes to analyze their number and distribution on nondisjunction-prone human chromosomes and to characterize genome-wide levels of recombination in the human female. Our analyses indicate that the number of MLH1 foci is lower than predicted from genetic linkage analysis, but its localization pattern conforms to that expected for a crossover-associated protein. In studies of individual chromosomes, our observations provide evidence for the presence of “vulnerable” crossover configurations in the fetal oocyte, consistent with the idea that these are subsequently translated into nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. We evaluated the utility of MLH1 as a marker of crossing-over in females and asked whether achiasmate chromosomes and sub-optimal crossover patterns are a feature of human female meiosis.
Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, leishmaniasis, and arboviral infections, are transmitted by blood-feeding arthropods like mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks. When these arthropods bite a mammal, they inject saliva containing immunogenic compounds that can modulate the host's immune response. This pre-exposure to arthropod saliva can alter the course of disease progression if the host later becomes infected. Depending on the system in question, such pre-sensitisation of host immunity can either exacerbate or limit infection symptoms. We develop a general model of vector-borne disease to explore how immune pre-sensitisation alters the effects of vector control. Our model shows that if pre-sensitisation leads to more rapid clearance of infection, increasing vector mortality rates may achieve greater than expected disease control. However, if pre-sensitisation prolongs the duration of infection, increasing vector mortality rates can actually increase the total number of infected hosts. This may go unnoticed unless active surveillance methods are used to detect sub-clinical individuals who could provide long-lasting reservoirs for transmission and suffer long-term health consequences.
Leishmaniasis is an important disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases every year. Leishmania amazonensis is an important agent in Brazil, leading to clinical forms varying from localized cutaneous leishmaniasis ( LCL ) to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis ( DCL ). To study the effect of the host immune system on Leishmania protein expression, we compared proteomes of amastigotes isolated from BALB/c and BALB/c nude mice. BALB/c nude mice resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis, considered T-cell hyposensitive or anergic to Leishmania´s antigens. Among the 44 differentially expressed spots, there were proteins related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases. Some correspond to known Leishmania virulence factors such as oligopeptidase B ( OPB ) and tryparedoxin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these two proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting that T cells probably restrain their posttranslational modifications in BALB/c mice. On the other hand, an isoform of HSP70 was increased in amastigotes from BALB/c mice.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase ( AID ) initiates immunoglobulin gene diversification in activated B cells by deaminating cytosines to uracils. AID is potentially highly mutagenic and causes genomic instability, evident as chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. Here we show that AID is cell cycle regulated. By high content screening microscopy, we demonstrate that AID undergoes nuclear degradation more slowly in G1 phase than in S or G2-M phase, and that mutations that affect regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter AID stability and abundance. We directly test the role of cell cycle regulation by fusing AID to tags that destabilize nuclear protein outside of G1 or S-G2/M phases. We show that enforced nuclear localization of AID in G1 phase accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, and is well-tolerated; while nuclear AID compromises viability in S-G2/M phase cells. We identify AID derivatives that accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, which will be useful tools for engineering genes and proteins by iterative mutagenesis and selection.
Clostridium phytofermentans, a soil bacterium with 171 carbohydrate-active enzyme ( CAZyme )-encoding genes, is capable of fermenting a wide range of plant polysaccharides including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. We developed a method to analyze how microbes catabolize plant polysaccharides by integrating CAZyme assays, RNA sequencing, and anaerobic growth screening. We applied this method to C. phytofermentans and found that it ferments plant biomass components with variable efficiencies and prioritizes metabolism of preferred substrates. We identified 56 up-regulated CAZymes that were purified and tested for their ability to bind and cleave plant polysaccharides. These enzymes were then tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. We found that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with divergent rates, specificities, and cellular localizations. These results advance our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass and have implications for the development of improved enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing of plant biomass.
In Sierra Leone, three rounds of mass drug administration ( MDA ) were conducted between 2008 and 2010 to control lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) in 12 districts that were co-endemic for LF and onchocerciasis. The districts had previously been treated for onchocerciasis since 2003 using the Community-Directed Treatment with Ivermectin ( CDTI ) strategy. A midterm assessment was conducted in 2011 to evaluate the impact of the MDAs on LF prevalence. The results showed a significant decrease in microfilaria ( mf ) prevalence from 2. 6% in 2007–2008 to 0. 3% in 2011, a reduction of 88. 5% ( p = 0. 000 ). In four districts ( Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono ), mf prevalence decreased to 0. 0% ( 100. 0% decrease ), and in seven other districts, mf prevalence decreased by between 70. 0% and 95. 0% ( p = 0. 000, 0. 060, 0. 001, 0. 014, 0. 000, 0. 000, and 0. 002 for Bombali, Bonthe, Kailahun, Kambia, Koinadugu, Port Loko, and Tonkolili districts, respectively ). Only Bombali district still had an mf prevalence ≥1. 0% ( 1. 58%, 95% CI: 0. 80%–3. 09% ), which had the highest baseline mf prevalence of 6. 9% ( 95% CI: 5. 3%–8. 8% ). The overall arithmetic mean mf density after three MDAs was 17. 59 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 15. 64 mf/ml–19. 55 mf/ml ) among mf-positive individuals ( 65. 4% decrease from baseline of 50. 9 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 40. 25 mf/ml–61. 62 mf/ml; p = 0. 001 ) and 0. 05 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 0. 03 mf/ml–0. 08 mf/ml ) for the entire population examined ( 96. 2% decrease from baseline of 1. 32 mf/ml ( 95% CI: 1. 00 mf/ml–1. 65 mf/ml; p = 0. 000 ) ).
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between members of these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, the analysis of compositional data can produce unreliable results since the observed data take the form of relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, we show that such compositional effects can be widespread and severe: in some real data sets many of the correlations among taxa can be artifactual, and true correlations may even appear with opposite sign. We show that community diversity is the key factor that modulates the acuteness of such compositional effects, and develop a new approach, called SparCC, which is capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. To illustrate a potential application of SparCC, we infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. Using the SparCC network as a reference, we estimated that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data, and most of the erroneous links are found in the samples with the lowest diversity.
The muramidase activity of human lysozyme is responsible for its antimicrobial effect against Streptococcus pneumoniae, a bacterium that colonizes the upper respiratory tract. Lysozyme is abundant on mucosal surfaces, suggesting that successful colonizers must be able to evade its antimicrobial effects. Two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, modify the peptidoglycan of S. pneumoniae and have been implicated in its resistance to lysozyme in vitro. Here, we show that both modifications are required for full resistance to lysozyme and that the muramidase activity of lysozyme is responsible for its antimicrobial effect against pneumococci. We also show that the combined effect of PgdA and Adr on resistance to human lysozyme is due to its muramidase activity, rather than its non-muramidase activity. In competition experiments with wild-type and pgdAadr mutant pneumococci in lysozyme M-sufficient and -deficient mice, the wild-type strain out-competed the double mutant in lysozyme M-sufficient mice, but not in lysozyme M-deficient mice. In contrast, strains containing single mutations in either pgdA or adr prevailed over the wild-type strain in both lysozyme M-sufficient and lysozyme M-deficient mice. Our findings demonstrate that individual peptidoglycan modifications diminish fitness during colonization and that the combination of peptidoglycan modifications reduces overall fitness, but that this is outweighed by the benefits of resistance to the peptidoglycan degrading activity of lysozyme.
Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide in terms of morbidity and mortality. In Brazil, which is responsible for approximately 80% of dengue cases in the Americas, a total of 5, 944, 270 cases have been reported since the introduction of dengue in 1986, including 21, 596 dengue hemorrhagic fever and 874 fatal cases. The goal of this study was to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool to detect dengue virus ( DENV ) in tissue specimens from previously confirmed dengue fatal cases ( n = 23 ) that occurred in Brazil in 2002. We evaluated three tests for NS1 antigen capture: Dengue Early ELISA ( PanBio Diagnostics ), Platelia NS1 ( BioRad Laboratories ) and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip ( BioRad Laboratories ). The overall dengue fatal case diagnosis based on the tissues analyzed by Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1 and the NS1 Ag Strip was 34. 7% ( 08/23 ), 60. 8% ( 14/23 ) and 91. 3% ( 21/23 ), respectively. The Dengue Early ELISA detected NS1 in 22. 9% ( 17/74 ) of the specimens analyzed and the Platelia NS1 in 45. 9% ( 34/74 ). The highest sensitivity ( 78. 3%; 58/74 ) was achieved by the NS1 Ag Strip, and the differences in the sensitivities were statistically significant ( p<0. 05 ). The NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive in liver ( 91. 3%; 21/23 ), lung ( 71. 4%; 10/14 ), kidney ( 100%; 4/4 ), brain ( 80%; 8/10 ), spleen ( 66. 6%, 10/15 ) and thymus ( 100%, 3/3 ) when compared to the other two ELISA assays.
Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) is a plasma cell malignancy with a higher incidence and mortality rate among African Americans ( AA ) compared to Caucasians ( CA ). To elucidate differences in molecular alterations in MM as a function of self-reported race and genetic ancestry, we analyzed somatic whole exome, RNA-sequencing, and clinical data from 718 MM patients from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass study Interim Analysis 9. Somatic mutational analyses revealed significant differences in mutation frequency between AA and CA cases. Notably, BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2 demonstrated significantly higher mutation frequencies among AA cases. These genes are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. In contrast, TP53 and IRF4 mutation frequencies were higher among CA cases. Our study provides rationale for interrogating diverse tumor cohorts to understand tumor genomics across populations.
Clonal and subclonal passenger mutations in the exome of cancer cells can provide important information about the evolutionary history of an individual cancer and serve as a molecular clock. We study the stochastic expansion of a population of cancer cells describing the growth of primary tumors or metastatic lesions. We first analyze the process by looking forward in time and calculate the fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive passenger mutations ordered by their time of appearance. We compute the likelihood of specific evolutionary trees, thereby informing the phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer evolution in individual patients. Next, we derive results looking backward in time: for a given subclonal mutation we estimate the number of cancer cells that were present at the time when that mutation arose. We derive exact formulas for the expected numbers of subclonal mutations of any frequency. Fitting this formula to cancer sequencing data leads to an estimate for the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells during the early stages of clonal expansion. We show that the frequencies of the first and thus most abundant passenger mutations are influenced not only by the mutation rate, but also by the death-birth ratio of the cancer cells.
Polyglutamine ( polyQ ) expansion in the first exon ( XN1 ) of the huntingtin protein is linked to Huntington's disease. When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36–40 repeats, XN1 can readily form amyloid aggregates similar to those associated with the disease. Misfolding of monomeric XN1 plays an important role in the length-dependent aggregation of XN1. The flanking sequences surrounding the polyQ region can play a critical role in determining the structural rearrangement and aggregation mechanism of XN1. To elucidate the misfolding of XN1 toward amyloid aggregation, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric XN1 with full flanking regions, a variant missing the polyproline regions, and an isolated polyQ peptide ( Qn ). We studied glutamine repeat lengths of 23, 36, 40 and 47 for each of these three constructs. We found that polyQ peptides have a positive correlation between their probability to form a β-rich misfolded state and their expansion length. We also found that the flanking regions of XN1 affect its probability to form a β-rich state compared to the isolated polyQ. The polyproline regions form polyproline type II helices and decrease the probability of the polyQ region to form a β-rich state.
The CRISPR ( Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats ) loci, together with cas ( CRISPR–associated ) genes, form the CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system that eubacteria and archaea use to defend against foreign nucleic acids, such as phages and conjugative plasmids. To explore the distribution and diversity of CRISPRs in human-associated microbial communities, we analyzed hundreds of shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project ( HMP ). We developed a targeted assembly strategy to reconstruct CRISPR arrays that whole-metagenome assemblies fail to identify. We used the direct repeat consensus sequence of each known CRISPR type to recruit reads from each HMP dataset and then assembled the recruited reads into CRISPR loci. We also identified novel CRISPRs or new CRISPR variants in contigs from whole-metagenome assemblies and used targeted assembly to more comprehensively identify these CRISPRs across samples. We found that the distributions of CRISPRs, including 64 known and 86 novel ones, are largely body-site specific. For example, known streptococcal CRISPRs were identified in most oral microbiomes, totaling ∼8, 000 unique spacers. This work indicates the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRISPR loci to the study of the dynamic ecology of microbiomes.
In this study, we report the first identification of circadian-regulated transcripts in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Using genome-wide expression profiling, we show that subsets of transcripts exhibit rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-h periods and are sustained under constant conditions, suggesting that they are under circadian regulation. We find that light and temperature cycles strongly drive gene expression and appear to entrain largely nonoverlapping gene sets. Furthermore, we show that light and temperature can act as zeitgebers and drive as well as entrain transcripts at the genome-wide level. Our results suggest that C. elegans may utilize a timekeeping mechanism that is distinct from that described previously in other animals. We also find that the TAX-2 cyclic nucleotide-gated channel subunit is required to transduce both light and temperature information to the clock, implying that environmental cues act cell nonautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. Together, these findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans and suggest that further analyses in this organism will provide new information about the evolution and function of this biological clock.
Reciprocal products of mitotic recombination in rad3-101 and rad3-102 hyper-recombination ( hyper-Rec ) mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been further characterized using a system in which the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination are recovered. Both rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevate the frequency of reciprocal crossovers about 100-fold. Mapping of these events shows that three-quarters of these crossovers reflect double sister-chromatid breaks ( DSCBs ), while the remainder reflects single chromatid breaks ( SCBs ). The ratio of DSCBs to SCBs is similar to that observed for spontaneous recombination events in wild-type cells. We mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations throughout the genome, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications, and found a significant association between the location of these recombination events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX. In addition, there was a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, has a large set of simple sequence repeats ( SSRs ) that constitute contingency loci. These SSRs generate heterogeneous populations through a slipped strand mispairing mechanism, facilitating adaptation to the ever-changing host environment. Here, we present a model that explains how an intergenically located T-tract, via slipped strand mispairing, operates with a rheostat-like function to fine-tune activity of the promoter that drives expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin, SabA. We show that the length of the T-tract generates multiphasic output from the sabA promoter, altering the H. pylori binding to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on gastric mucosa. In silico and functional in vitro analyzes revealed that the length of the T-tract affects the local DNA structure and thereby binding of the RNA polymerase, through shifting of the axial alignment between the core promoter and UP-like elements. We identified additional genes in H. pylori, with T- or A-tracts positioned similar to that of sabA, and show that variations in the tract length likewise acted as rheostats to modulate cognate promoter output. Thus, we propose that this generally applicable mechanism, mediated by promoter-proximal SSRs, provides an alternative mechanism for transcriptional regulation in bacteria, such as H. pylori, which possesses a limited repertoire of classical trans-acting regulatory factors.
Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is a high-risk virus that must evade the innate immune response to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon epithelial differentiation. The JAK-STAT transcriptional regulator, STAT-5, plays an important role in modulating the inflammatory response and controlling cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. Our studies show that the HPV E7 protein activates STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. Inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation by the drug pimozide abolishes viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes. In contrast, treatment of undifferentiated cells that stably maintain episomes has no effect on viral replication. Knockdown studies show that the STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity and that this is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ( PPARγ ) is a downstream target of STAT-5 and contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway. Overall, these findings identify an important new regulatory mechanism by which the innate immune regulator, STAT-5, promotes HPV viral replication through activation of the ATM DNA damage response.
Typhoid fever, caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi ( S. Typhi ), is a major public health problem in typhoid endemic areas. Chronic carriers of S. Typhi may act as persistent reservoirs of infection, introducing the disease to susceptible individuals and new communities. However, little is known about the interaction between the host and pathogen in the biliary tract of chronic carriers, and there is currently no reliable diagnostic assay to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriage. To study host-pathogen interactions in the biliary tract during S. Typhi carriage, we applied an immunoscreening technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology ( IVIAT ) to identify potential biomarkers unique to carriers. We hypothesized that S. Typhi surviving in the biliary tract of humans may express a distinct antigenic profile. Thirteen S. Typhi antigens that were immunoreactive in carriers, but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area, were identified. The identified antigens included a number of putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. One antigen, YncE ( STY1479 ), an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, gave prominent responses in our screen. Further evaluation of YncE and other antigens identified by IVIAT could lead to the development of improved diagnostic assays to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers.
Trans-reactivation is a new epigenetic phenomenon in which non-functional alleles of a gene can reactivate the expression of a wild type copy of the same gene that is silenced by heterochromatin. In this phenomenon, non-functional alleles of the white gene, which are unable to produce a coding transcript, can reactivate the expression of a wild type copy of white that is silenced by heterochromatin. This effect is heritable, relies on the presence of homologous RNA molecules, and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing. Our data suggest that trans-reactivation is a new level of gene expression control mediated by homologous RNA molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes. The mechanisms of trans-reactivation appear to be different from previously characterized epigenetic reprogramming events, such as paramutation, transinduction, and transvection. In trans-reactivation, transcribing RNAs that are unable to produce a full coding transcript can positively influence the transcriptional state of an homologous locus silenced by heterochromatin. The presence of non-functional white alleles causes an increase in the wm4h gene transcript as well as an opening in the chromatin structure at the wm4h locus.
Boophilin is a multifunctional Kunitz protease inhibitor expressed in the midgut of the tick vector Rhipicephalus microplus. It targets thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein in the coagulation and complement cascades. Boophilin was expressed in HEK293 cells, purified to homogeneity, and characterized using amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments. The results show that Boophilin behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to small chromogenic substrates, with a Ki of ~ 100 nM. It also inhibits thrombin in a non-canonical manner, despite possessing a canonical reactive site loop. Boophilin blocks platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in vitro. Notably, it also inhibits FXIa, preventing FIX activation, and kallikrein activity, indicating that it targets the contact pathway. In addition, Boophilin inhibits cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor ( TFPI ). Finally, Boophilin inhibits carotid artery occlusion in vivo triggered by FeCl3 and promotes bleeding according to the mice tail transection method.
Inflammation plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of many gastrointestinal diseases. The mucosa of the intestinal tract is a finely tuned system where tissue structure influences and is influenced by its function as both an absorptive surface and a defensive barrier. We have developed the Spatially Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue ( SEGMEnT ) to dynamically represent existing knowledge of the behavior of enteric epithelial tissue as influenced by inflammation. SEGMEnT is an agent-based computational model that simulates the cellular and molecular interactions that maintain and modify the enteric mucosal architecture. It models the spatial dynamics of the crypt-villus tissue architecture as generated by the behavior of gut epithelial cells as they undergo replication, migration, and differentiation, with the novel incorporation of the effect of inflammation on those morphogenic processes. SEGMEnT represents a minimally sufficient set of components and interactions to achieve a face valid representation of the mechanisms involved in maintaining the enteric mucosal architecture ( morphogenesis ) and its response to an initial set of perturbations ( inflammation ). In addition to reproducing healthy ileal mucosal dynamics, SEGMEnT provides insight into a range of clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as a putative role for PTEN/PI3K as a key point of crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion, and chronic low level inflammation as a driver for colonic metaplasia. These results suggest that SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a major vector of arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Traditional vector control methods have limited effect on reducing Ae. aegypti populations. Wolbachia, an endosymbiotic bacterium, has been proposed as a promising tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission. The wMelBr strain of Wolbachia was released in the community of Tubiacanga, Rio de Janeiro for 20 consecutive weeks. However, the frequency of Wolbachia-positive Ae. aegypti mosquitoes plateaued at around 40% after 7–19 weeks and declined after releases stopped. This was attributed to the high level of pyrethroid resistance in the local Ae. aegypti population. A new strain, wMelRio, was produced by backcrossing wMelBr females with males from the field to introduce pyrethroid resistance alleles. The wMelRio strain successfully established in the local population where wMelBr failed, highlighting the importance of matching the local population genetics, especially the insecticide resistance background, to achieve Wolbachia invasion. The wMelRio strain increased mosquito survival but had negative effects on Ae. aegypti fecundity traits. The results suggest that Wolbachia deployment should match the insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to achieve invasion.
Poxviruses are complex viruses that have evolved sophisticated signaling pathways to engage cellular defense mechanisms while ensuring proper modulation of viral factors. The vaccinia B1 protein kinase plays a crucial role in inactivating the cellular antiviral factor BAF and likely orchestrates other pathways as well. In this study, we used experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus to identify novel pathways involving B1. After several passages of the ΔB1 virus, we observed a robust increase in viral titer of the adapted virus. Characterization of the adapted viruses revealed that mutations correlating with a loss of function of the vaccinia B12 pseudokinase provide a striking fitness enhancement to this virus. We present multiple lines of evidence demonstrating that expression of full length B12 leads to a fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B1, but has no apparent impact on wild-type virus or other mutant poxviruses. We infer that B12 possesses a potent inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of the B1 kinase. B12 primarily localizes to the nucleus and may function in part by enhancing antiviral activity of BAF. Our studies of B1 and B12 present novel evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship in a virus, perhaps serving to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and to orchestrate yet-to-be-discovered nuclear events during infection.
The conformational behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, with built-in secondary α-helical amphiphilicity, has been studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The peptides are neither random coils nor fully formed α-helices in bulk water, but instead adopt multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes on the order of 100 ns or less. The α-helix conformation is not stable in bulk water, and the peptides display a variety of secondary structures, including partial α-helices. The conformation of these intrinsically disordered peptides strongly depends on the environment. The presence of a macroscopic vacuum/water interface leads to a strong partitioning of hydrophobic/hydrophilic residues, which enforces a unique conformation by stabilizing the α-helical form for both model systems. In the case of the LK peptide, the bulk water ensemble is already dominated by conformations where a large fraction of the residues are in an α-helical state. Differences in the peptides’ response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces can be linked to their inherent α-helical tendencies in bulk water. The peptides’ aggregation behavior is also strongly affected by the presence or absence of an interface, and rather subtly depends on their surface charge and hydrophobicity.
Human herpesvirus 6A ( HHV-6A ) and 6B ( HHV-6B ) are ubiquitous betaherpesviruses that infect humans within the first years of life and establish latency in various cell types. Both viruses can integrate their genomes into telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. The molecular mechanism of viral integration has remained elusive. Interestingly, HHV-6A, HHV-6B and several other herpesviruses harbor arrays of telomeric repeats ( TMR ) identical to human telomere sequences at the ends of their genomes. To determine if the TMR are involved in virus integration, we deleted both pTMR and impTMR in the HHV-6A genome. Upon reconstitution, the TMR mutant virus replicated comparable to wild type ( wt ) virus, indicating that the TMR are not essential for HHV-6A replication. However, integration of HHV-6A was severely impaired in the absence of the TMR and the virus genome was lost rapidly, suggesting that integration is crucial for the maintenance of the virus genome. Individual deletion of the pTMR and impTMR revealed that the pTMR play the major role in HHV-6A integration, whereas the impTMR only make a minor contribution, allowing us to establish a model for HHV-6A integration. Taken together, our data shows that the HHV-6A TMR are dispensable for virus replication, but are crucial for integration and maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells.
Poxviruses are unique among enveloped viruses in that they do not acquire their internal lipid membrane by budding through cellular compartments. Instead, they produce infectious particles from atypical crescent-shaped precursors whose architecture and composition have been contentious. Here, we describe the 2. 6 Å crystal structure of vaccinia virus D13, a key structural component of the outer scaffold of viral crescents. D13 folds into two jellyrolls decorated by a head domain of novel fold and assembles into trimers that are homologous to the double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid-containing icosahedral viruses. We show that when tethered onto artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice and assembly products structurally similar to the viral crescents and immature particles. The architecture of the D13 honeycomb lattice and the lipid-remodeling abilities of D13 support a model of assembly that exhibits similarities with the giant mimivirus. Overall, these findings establish that the first committed step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. Furthermore, D13 is the target of rifampicin and its structure will aid the development of poxvirus assembly inhibitors.
Brachypodium distachyon ( Brachypodium ) is a monocotyledonous plant used as a model organism to study plant development. In contrast to Arabidopsis thaliana ( Arabidopsis ), a dicotyledonous plant, Brachypodium mutants in the TAR2-LIKE ( BdTAR2L ) gene, which encodes a tryptophan aminotransferase involved in auxin biosynthesis, display dramatically elongated seminal roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype is also observed in another BdTAR2L allele and can be mimicked by treating wild type with L-kynerunine, a specific TAA1/TAR inhibitor. Surprisingly, L-kynerunine-treated as well as Bdtar2l roots display elevated rather than reduced auxin levels, which does not appear to result from compensation by alternative auxin biosynthesis pathways. Instead, expression of YUCCA genes, which are rate-limiting for conversion of indole-3-pyruvic acid ( IPA ) to auxin, is increased in Bdtar2l mutants. Our results reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene activity to control cell elongation in Brachypodium roots and suggest alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk as compared to Arabidopsis.
The organization of promoter nucleosomes has been found to shape the evolution of gene expression in species of the budding yeast. The rate at which genes diverge in expression correlates with the organization of their promoter nucleosomes: genes lacking a nucleosome-free region ( OPN ) vary widely between species, while the expression of those containing a nucleosome-free region ( DPN ) remains largely conserved. To examine if early evolutionary dynamics contributes to this difference in divergence, we artificially selected for high expression of GFP–fused proteins. Surprisingly, selection was equally successful for OPN and DPN genes, with ∼80% of genes in each group stably increasing in expression by a similar amount. Notably, the two groups adapted by distinct mechanisms: DPN–selected strains duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN–selected strains favored trans mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN ( but not OPN ) genes reverted rapidly to wild-type expression levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species. Our results suggest that promoter organization constrains the early evolutionary dynamics and in this way biases the path of long-term evolution.
The human T lymphotropic virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) trans-activator/oncoprotein, Tax, is thought to promote cell proliferation and transformation by activating I-κB kinases ( IKKs ) and NF-κB. However, in most cells, Tax expression leads to the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, resulting in p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence. Here, we demonstrate that p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations in Tax that reduce IKK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα. We show that RelA induces this senescence program by acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex and RelB to stabilize p27KIP1 protein and p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA, respectively. Finally, we show that down-regulation of NF-κB by the HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, delays or prevents the onset of Tax-induced senescence. We propose that the balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection. Robust HTLV-1 replication and elevated Tax expression drive IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation and trigger senescence, while HBZ modulates Tax-mediated viral replication and NF-κB activation, allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate, persist, and evolve.
The frontal lobes of the human brain are responsible for decision-making and executive control, which involves the selection and coordination of goal-directed behaviors. However, current models of frontal executive function do not fully explain how humans make decisions in everyday situations that are uncertain, changing, and open-ended. Here, we propose a computational model of human executive function that clarifies this issue. The proposed model predicts human decisions and their variations across individuals in naturalistic situations. It reveals that the human frontal function monitors up to three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict action outcomes. When one strategy appears more reliable than others, it is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. Otherwise, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed from those stored in long-term memory, then probed, and if competitive, confirmed to drive action. The human executive function has a monitoring capacity limited to three or four behavioral strategies, which is compensated by a binary structure of executive control that promotes the exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies in ambiguous and unknown situations. The results support a model of human frontal function that integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior.
Pharmacological interventions are increasingly used to treat progressive diseases, but their long-term effects are difficult to predict. To address this challenge, we present a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories ( ADAPT ). ADAPT employs mathematical modeling to predict the long-term effects of a pharmacological intervention by introducing a concept of time-dependent descriptions of model parameters to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations. This approach dynamically links different experimentally observed phenotypes as a function of time, providing an integrated understanding of the outcome of a pharmacological intervention or disease progression. We applied ADAPT to a model of hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to predict the metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological treatment of mice with the liver X receptor ( LXR ) agonist T0901317. Our computational analysis showed that although activation of LXR promotes cholesterol efflux and excretion, the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol was reduced upon prolonged treatment. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting measurements of scavenger receptor class B1 ( SR-B1 ) in hepatic membranes. ADAPT can be used to identify potential unwanted side effects of pharmacological interventions and to design new target interventions to prevent them.
The cerebellum plays a crucial role in the coordination of our multi-segmented bodies and limbs. However, the mechanisms that underlie this function are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a new hypothesis for how the spinocerebellar systems and the cerebellar cortex interact to support coordination. Our hypothesis suggests that the spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations of sensory and motor signals to the cerebellar cortex, which can be described as linear projections through the multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. These projections are enhanced by the cerebellar granule layer, which allows the Purkinje cell to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. We argue that the close correspondence between sensor signals and motor command signals in the individual neurons of the spinocerebellar system is a means to avoid superfluous recombinations and to form ‘good enough’ recombinations with a high probability. Our hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, illustrating how the coordinating functions of the cerebellum can be crucially supported by the recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems.
Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) infection in Aedes albopictus, an important mosquito vector, leads to changes in the expression of microRNAs ( miRNAs ). miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are involved in various cellular processes. In this study, we identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV infected Ae. albopictus cell lines, respectively. We further identified nine novel miRNAs in Ae. albopictus. Comparison of the two libraries revealed differential expression of 77 common miRNAs between them. CHIKV infection specifically altered the miRNA profile of a specific set of eight miRNAs. We identified putative targets of these regulated miRNAs and classified them into their pathways. We further analyzed the distribution and abundance of these miRNAs and evaluated their modulation upon CHIKV infection. We identified four significantly over-expressed miRNAs ( miR-100, miR-283, miR-305-3p and miR-927 ) and four under-expressed miRNAs ( miR-1000, miR-2b, miR-2c-3p and miR-190-5p ) upon CHIKV infection in Ae. albopictus.
Cystic echinococcosis ( CE ) is a parasitic infection of humans and livestock with significant medical and economic importance in many developing countries, including Iran. The present study aimed to determine the monetary burden of CE in Iran using epidemiological and economic data obtained from regional hospitals, the scientific literature, and official government reports. The study estimated the mean number of surgical CE cases per year for 2000–2009 at 1, 295, and the number of asymptomatic individuals living in the country at 635, 232 ( 95% Credible Interval, CI 149, 466–1, 120, 998 ). The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at US$232. 3 million ( 95% CI US$103. 1–397. 8 million ), including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at US$93. 39 million ( 95% CI US$6. 1–222. 7 million ) and the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at US$132 million ( 95% CI US$61. 8–246. 5 million ). The cost per surgical human case was estimated at US$1, 539. The economic impact of CE on Iran was considerable, with the cost of the disease approximated at 0. 03% of the country's gross domestic product.
Mouse polyomavirus ( MPyV ) is a highly oncogenic virus that infects mouse cells, transforms rat cells in culture, and causes cancer in rodents. In this study, we have used deep sequencing to follow MPyV infection of mouse NIH3T6 cells at various times after infection and analyzed both the viral and cellular transcriptomes. We found that both early-strand and late-strand RNAs are transcribed at all times after infection, and that there is widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts at late times in infection. By 36 hours after infection, 359 host genes were significantly upregulated and 857 were downregulated. Gene ontology analysis revealed that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, while transcripts involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc finger binding, SH3 domain, and GTPase activation were downregulated. We also found that the levels of a number of long noncoding RNAs were altered, including the downregulation of the long noncoding RNA MALAT1, which is involved in splicing speckles and used as a marker in many late-stage cancers.
Each year, hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon, but more than two-fifths experience severe and performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, a phenomenon known as ‘hitting the wall. ’ Previous analyses of endurance physiology have suggested that human glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon without ‘hitting the wall. ’ However, the present study demonstrates that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle and depend on several physiologic variables, including muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed. The study presents a computational model that estimates the distance at which runners will exhaust their glycogen stores as a function of running intensity. The model also provides a basis for guidelines ensuring the safety and optimizing the performance of endurance runners by setting personally appropriate paces and prescribing midrace fueling requirements to avoid ‘hitting the wall. ’ The analysis also sheds light on important standards in marathon running, such as the qualifying times for the Boston Marathon.
Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects a wide range of hosts and causes toxoplasmosis, a disease with variable outcomes in humans and mice. The parasite exists in three genetically distinct clonal lineages ( type I, II, and III ) in Europe and North America, but a great variety of other strains are found in South America. These strains differ in virulence, persistence, oral infectivity, migratory capacity, induction of cytokine expression, and modulation of host gene expression. To determine if non-canonical Toxoplasma strains have unique interactions with the host cell, we infected murine macrophages with 29 different Toxoplasma strains, representing global diversity, and used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. We identified large differences between strains in the expression level of known parasite effectors and large chromosomal structural variation in some strains. We also identified novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response by some atypical strains. We found that IFNβ production by infected cells was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma activation, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macrophages and the cytoplasmic receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 ( RIG-I ) in fibroblasts. Our study provides global insight into host cells and parasite transcriptional responses upon infection with both canonical and exotic Toxoplasma strains, and allows identification of novel strain-specific host cell responses and parasite effectors.
Recombination in enteroviruses is an evolutionary mechanism that allows for the acquisition of extensive regions of novel sequence and has been implicated in the emergence of novel neuropathogenic variants of poliovirus. Despite its importance, the recombination process in enteroviruses remains poorly understood. We investigated heterologous recombination in polioviruses using a novel reverse genetic approach that resulted in the isolation of intermediate chimeric intertypic polioviruses bearing genomes with extensive duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of viruses exhibiting such imprecise junctions yielded progeny with increased fitness that had lost the duplicated sequences. We propose that extant recombinants result from a biphasic process in which an initial recombination event is followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness. Mutations or inhibitors that changed polymerase fidelity or the coalescence of replication complexes markedly altered the yield of recombinants, indicating that the process is replicative and may be possible to enhance or reduce recombination-mediated viral evolution if required.
Beiging of white adipose tissue ( WAT ) is a promising target for the treatment of metabolic diseases, and norepinephrine ( NE ) -mediated signaling pathways play a key role in this process. Previous studies have identified NE clearance mechanisms via SLC6A2 on sympathetic neurons or proinflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues ( ATs ). However, the low catecholamine clearance capacity of SLC6A2 may limit the cleaning efficiency. Here, we report that mouse organic cation transporter 3 ( Oct3; Slc22a3 ) is highly expressed in WAT and displays the greatest uptake rate of NE as a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes. We further show that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes Maoa, Maob, and Comt, providing the molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3. Our results demonstrate that Oct3 is essential in catecholamine clearance in adipocytes of WAT and blunts intracellular responses upon sustained catecholamine stimulation by regulating the activity of β-AR. In adipose-specific Oct3-deficient mice, NE administration induces higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared with littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal WAT in adipose-specific Oct3-deficient mice shows much stronger browning characteristics and significantly elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes than in littermate controls.
HP1 proteins are a family of heterochromatin-enriched proteins that play a critical role in the regulation of transcription. They contain two related domains: the chromo-domain ( CD ) and the chromoshadow-domain ( CSD ). The CD binds to histone H3 tails that are methylated on lysine 9 ( H3K9 ), an epigenetic mark associated with transcriptional repression. However, in vivo and in vitro experiments have shown that the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor, and that the opening of chromatin during DNA replication facilitates their binding to nucleosomes. We show that HP1 proteins use the CSD to associate with histone H3 at the level of the entry/exit point of the nucleosome barrel, a region also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex, Brg1 and Brm. This interaction is essential for efficient SWI/SNF remodeling and is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. We also show that SWI/SNF activity favors the loading of HP1 proteins onto chromatin both in vivo and in vitro. Altogether, our data suggest that HP1 chromoshadow-domains can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and that HP1 proteins use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling.
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are a class of functional RNAs that require structural invariance during biogenesis, which involves extraction of the substructure from a larger structural context. We define the property of self containment to be the tendency for an RNA sequence to robustly adopt the same optimal secondary structure regardless of whether it exists in isolation or is a substring of a longer sequence of arbitrary nucleotide content. We developed a scoring method called the self-containment index to measure the degree of self containment. We found that miRNA stem loops exhibit high self containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway, while most other structured RNAs do not. Further analysis revealed a trend toward higher self containment among clustered and conserved miRNAs, suggesting that high self containment may be a characteristic of novel miRNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. We found that miRNAs display significantly enhanced self containment compared to other functional RNAs, but we also found a trend toward natural selection for self containment in most functional RNA classes. We suggest that self containment arises out of selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of structural function.
Necrotrophic fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina, cause disease in plants by killing host cells and using them as a nutrient source. Although several signaling components of disease resistance against necrotrophic fungal pathogens have been identified, our understanding of how molecular components and host processes contribute to plant disease susceptibility is limited. Here, we identified four transcription factors ( TFs ) from Arabidopsis that limit pathogen spread. Arabidopsis mutants defective in any of these TFs displayed increased disease susceptibility to Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina, and a general activation of non-immune host processes that contribute to plant disease susceptibility. Transcriptome analyses revealed that the mutants share a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes. We characterized several of the up-regulated genes that encode peptides with a secretion signal, which we named PROVIR ( for provirulence ) factors. Forward and reverse genetic analyses revealed that many of the PROVIRs are important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs. Over-expression of many of the PROVIR factors in Arabidopsis conferred increased susceptibility to the necrotroph P. cucumerina, and, conversely, loss-of-function mutants conferred increased resistance.
FOXO1 is a transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating uterine epithelial integrity and progesterone receptor (PGR) expression, both of which are essential for successful embryo implantation. We demonstrate that uterine ablation of Foxo1 in mice results in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, which prevents the embryo from penetrating the luminal epithelium. The uterine transcriptome after Foxo1 ablation shows alterations in gene expression for transcripts involved in cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-catenin ( CTNNB1 ) signaling pathway, and an increase in PGR signaling. The increase in PGR signaling is due to PGR expression being retained in the uterine epithelium during the window of receptivity. Constitutive expression of epithelial PGR during this receptive period inhibits expression of FOXO1 in the nucleus of the uterine epithelium. The reciprocal expression of PGR and FOXO1 is conserved in human endometrial samples during the proliferative and secretory phase. This demonstrates that expression of FOXO1 and the loss of PGR during the window of receptivity are interrelated and critical for embryo implantation. FOXO1 regulates the expression of multiple components of signaling pathways that establish the receptive phase, including activation of cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, CTNNB1 signaling pathway, as well as inhibition of PGR signaling in the murine endometrial epithelium.
Dengue fever is a major public health concern in Bangladesh, with the majority of reported cases occurring between August and September. We present the first model-based estimates of the monthly geographical distribution of dengue cases in Bangladesh using a negative binomial generalised linear mixed effect model accounting for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal random effects. The model was fitted to the district-level monthly reported dengue cases aggregated over the period 2000 to 2009. We found that mean monthly temperature and its interaction with mean monthly diurnal temperature range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with dengue incidence. Mean monthly rainfall at two months lag was positively associated with dengue incidence. Densely populated districts and districts bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated that 92% of the annual dengue cases occurred between August and September. Cases were identified across the country with 94% in the capital Dhaka. Less than half of the affected districts reported cases as observed from the surveillance data. The proportion reported varied by month with a higher proportion reported in high-incidence districts, but dropped towards the end of the high transmission season.
Mice are known to establish a preferred place in a novel environment, characterized by the highest number of visits and longest cumulative time spent in it, which we term the home base. In addition to the home base, we have identified a new type of preferred place called a knot, which is marked by the performance of a tortuous path full of twists and turns during exploratory behavior in an open field arena. This behavior is termed knot-scribbling. Knots are characterized by a high path density, frequent visits that do not involve knot-scribbling, and a higher speed on the way into the knot than on the way out of it. Unlike the home base, knots are not characterized by long visits and are typically situated in the place of introduction into the arena, away from walls. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting the mouse with saline and placing it in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and the associated arousal consolidate a long-term contingency between a particular locale and knot-scribbling. Knot-scribbling could function as a way to obtain an overview of the entire environment, allowing re-calibration of the mouse's locale map and compass directions.
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes more deaths than malaria worldwide. We identified the ergoline compound NGx04 in an antifungal screen with selectivity over mammalian cells. High-resolution chemogenomics identified the lipid transfer protein Sec14p as the target of NGx04. Sec14p is essential for the pathogenicity of C. neoformans and is involved in the secretion of virulence determinants. We demonstrate that NGx04 inhibits the growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoformans and that NGx04-related compounds have equal and even higher potency against C. neoformans. Furthermore, NGx04 analogues showed fungicidal activity against a fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans strain. We present genetic evidence that NGx04 inhibits fungal Sec14p and initial data supporting NGx04 as a novel antifungal starting point.
Schistosomiasis, an often neglected tropical disease, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The only available drug for its treatment and control is praziquantel. However, the large-scale use of praziquantel may select for drug-resistant parasites. Therefore, there is a need to develop new antischistosomal compounds. Here, we report that the antimalarial drug mefloquine possesses promising antischistosomal properties in mice. A single dose of mefloquine ( 200 or 400 mg/kg ) administered orally to mice infected with adult Schistosoma mansoni or adult S. japonicum resulted in high or complete total and female worm burden reductions ( 72. 3%–100% ). Importantly, high worm burden reductions were also observed for young developing stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum harbored in the mouse. Both mefloquine erythro-enantiomers resulted in high and comparable total and female worm burden reductions when given to mice with either a sub-patent or patent S. mansoni infection. Our findings hold promise for the development of a novel antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality. Further in vitro and in vivo studies have been launched to elucidate the possible mechanism of action and to study the effect of mefloquine on S. haematobium and other trematodes.
Podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis causing massive swelling of the lower legs, has been identified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) since 2011. However, the geographical distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon remains poorly understood. This study aimed to map the distribution of podoconiosis in Cameroon using parasitological, serological, and clinical evidence to exclude other causes of lymphedema. A multi-stage sampling design was used to select 76 villages from 40 health districts across ten regions of Cameroon. A total of 10, 178 individuals from 4, 603 households were surveyed, and 83 individuals with lymphedema were identified. After applying a clinical algorithm to exclude filarial-associated lymphedema, 52 individuals were diagnosed with podoconiosis. The overall prevalence of podoconiosis was found to be 0. 5% ( 95% CI; 0. 4–0. 7 ). Podoconiosis was found to be widespread in Cameroon, with at least one case identified in every region except the two surveyed villages in Adamawa. The prevalence of podoconiosis ranged from 0. 2% to 2. 7% across the 40 health districts surveyed.
In Drosophila female germline stem cells ( GSCs ), Notch signaling is increased with age and results in their removal from the niche. Clonal analysis revealed that GSCs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesiveness to the niche, thereby out-competing their neighbors with higher levels of Notch. This increased adhesiveness is altered through regulation of E-cadherin expression. Experimental enhancement of Notch signaling in GSCs hastens their age-dependent loss from the niche, and such loss is at least partially mediated by Sex lethal. However, disruption of Notch signaling in GSCs does not delay GSC loss during aging, and nor does it affect BMP signaling, which promotes self-renewal of GSCs. In contrast to GSCs, Notch signaling in niche cells is decreased with age, thus contributing to age-induced GSC loss. Our findings expose a novel role of Notch signaling in controlling GSC-niche adhesion in response to aging, and are also of relevance to metastatic cancer cells, in which Notch signaling suppresses cell adhesion.
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV, or HHV-5 ( human herpesvirus 5 ) ) encodes the UL97 protein, a kinase that phosphorylates the cellular retinoblastoma ( Rb ) tumor suppressor and lamin A/C proteins, which are also substrates of cellular cyclin-dependent kinases ( Cdks ). A functional complementation assay has shown that UL97 has authentic Cdk-like activity. The other seven human herpesviruses each encode a kinase with sequence and positional homology to UL97. These UL97-homologous proteins have been termed the conserved herpesvirus protein kinases ( CHPKs ). To determine if the Cdk-like activities of UL97 were shared by all of the CHPKs, we individually expressed epitope-tagged alleles of each protein in human Saos-2 cells to test for Rb phosphorylation, human U-2 OS cells to monitor nuclear lamina disruption and lamin A phosphorylation, or S. cerevisiae cdc28-13 mutant cells to directly assay for Cdk function. We found that the ability to phosphorylate Rb and lamin A, and to disrupt the nuclear lamina, was shared by all CHPKs from the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus families, but not by their alpha-herpesvirus homologs. Similarly, all but one of the beta and gamma CHPKs displayed bona fide Cdk activity in S. cerevisiae, while the alpha proteins did not.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, is a Gram-negative bacillus present in the environment in many tropical countries. Defining the global distribution of B. pseudomallei is important for developing a risk map for melioidosis, as it provides the geographical setting for preventive measures and raises awareness of the disease among healthcare workers in affected areas. Our objective was to review the literature on the detection of environmental B. pseudomallei, update the risk map for melioidosis, and propose international consensus guidelines for soil sampling. We found that global coverage was patchy, with a lack of studies in many areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur. The sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable, and not all were robust. We developed consensus guidelines with the goals of reducing the probability of false-negative results and providing affordable and ‘low-tech’ methodology applicable in both developed and developing countries. The proposed consensus guidelines provide the basis for the development of an accurate and comprehensive global map of environmental B. pseudomallei.
Dengue-virus entry into host cells is mediated by the envelope glycoprotein ( E ), which undergoes large-scale domain rearrangements to facilitate membrane fusion. We have identified peptides derived from the membrane proximal region of the E protein that bind specifically to the postfusion conformation of the E protein, which is a model for a fusion intermediate. These peptides inhibit dengue-virus infectivity, even when free peptide is removed from a preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. This suggests that the peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried with virions into endosomes, the compartment in which acidification initiates fusion. Binding depends on particle dynamics, as there is no inhibition of infectivity if preincubation and separation are at 4°C rather than 37°C. We propose a two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition, in which the peptides bind to the postfusion conformation of the E protein and prevent the transition to the fusion-competent conformation. Our data support and extend proposed mechanisms for how the E conformational change promotes membrane fusion, and suggest strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry.
Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is a major public health concern worldwide, with an estimated 4 million cases and 95, 000 deaths annually. Recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen highlight the need for rapid, low-cost, and sustainable methods for molecular analysis of V. cholerae in resource-limited settings. Here, we demonstrate that whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) of V. cholerae can be performed directly from stool specimens preserved on filter paper. We show that a minimum concentration of 0. 02 ng/μL of V. cholerae DNA is sufficient to produce quality genomic information. WGS confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci, and identified a variety of diarrheal pathogens from alkaline peptone water ( APW )-enriched specimen spotted filter papers. These results highlight the potential for this technique to explore the gut microbiome and identify co-infections that may impact the severity of disease. WGS also allowed for mapping of short reads from APW-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers, providing valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings. These results identified the presence of co-infecting pathogens and provided rare insight into the specific V. cholerae strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas.
Dynein, a cytoplasmic motor protein, has been identified as an essential regulator of epithelial polarity in Drosophila follicle cells. Through a genetic screen for epithelial defects, we have found that Dynein is required for apico–basal polarity. Our data suggest that Dynein acts through the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust ( Sdt ) to localize the transmembrane protein Crumbs, in part through the apical targeting of specific sdt mRNA isoforms. We have mapped the sdt mRNA localization signal to an alternatively spliced coding exon. The presence or absence of this exon corresponds to a developmental switch in sdt mRNA localization in which apical transcripts are only found during early stages of epithelial development, while unlocalized transcripts predominate in mature epithelia. This work represents the first demonstration that Dynein is required for epithelial polarity and suggests that mRNA localization may have a functional role in the regulation of apico–basal organization. Moreover, we introduce a unique mechanism in which alternative splicing of a coding exon is used to control mRNA localization during development.
Leishmania infantum, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, has traditionally been thought to reproduce clonally. However, recent studies have proposed the existence of a non-obligate sexual cycle in the extracellular stage of the parasite within the sand fly vector. In this study, we provide the first evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in Leishmania infantum. We have developed transgenic L. infantum lines expressing drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters, which were successfully exchanged within the sand fly midgut of the natural vector Phlebotomus perniciosus when individuals from these species were fed with a mixture of parental clones. Using the yellow phenotype and drug resistance markers, we provide evidence for genetic exchange in L. infantum. The hybrid progeny appeared to be triploid based on DNA content analysis. The hybrid clone analyzed was stable throughout the complete parasite life cycle. The progress of infections by the hybrid clone in BALB/c mice caused a reduction in parasite loads in both spleen and liver, and provided weight values similar to those obtained with uninfected mice. Spleen arginase activity was also significantly reduced relative to parental strains.
Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ), a major health problem in Ethiopia. Recently isolated strains from VL and HIV-VL co-infected patients in north and south Ethiopia were characterized as part of a longitudinal study on VL transmission. A total of 63 L. donovani strains were examined by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 ( ITS1 ), cysteine protease B ( cpb ), and HASPB ( k26 ). Interestingly, the k26 - PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia ( 36/40 ) produced a 290 bp product with a minority ( 4/40 ) giving a 410 bp amplicon. All of the latter strains were isolated from patients with HIV-VL co-infections, while the former group contained both VL and HIV-VL co-infected patients. Almost all the strains ( 20/23 ) from southwestern Ethiopia produced a 450 bp amplicon with smaller products ( 290 or 360 bp ) only observed for three strains. Sudanese strains produced amplicons identical ( 290 bp ) to those found in northwestern Ethiopia; while Kenyan strains gave larger PCR products ( 500 and 650 bp ). High-resolution melt ( HRM ) analysis distinguished the different PCR products. Sequence analysis showed that the k26 repeat region in L. donovani is comprised of polymorphic 13 and 14 amino acid motifs. The 13 amino acid peptide motifs, prevalent in L. donovani, are rare in L. infantum. The number and order of the repeats in L. donovani varies between geographic regions. HASPB repeat region ( k26 ) shows considerable polymorphism among L. donovani strains from different regions in East Africa.
Recombinant HIV-1 genomes contribute significantly to the diversity of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and it is assumed that some of these mosaic genomes may have novel properties that have led to their prevalence. To test this hypothesis, we generate a probabilistic model of HIV-1 copy-choice recombination and compare the predicted breakpoint distribution to the distribution from the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We find that across much of the HIV-1 genome, the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination are predicted accurately by our model. This indicates that in these regions a probabilistic model, dependent on local sequence identity, is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. However, in regions where there is a significant over- ( either side of the env gene ) or under- ( short regions within gag, pol, and most of env ) representation of breakpoints, we infer natural selection to be influencing the recombination pattern. The paucity of recombination breakpoints within most of the envelope gene indicates that recombinants generated in this region are less likely to be successful. Our findings provide the first clear indication of the existence of a specific portion of the genome that deviates from a probabilistic null model for recombination. This suggests that despite the wide diversity of recombinant forms seen in the viral population, only a minority of recombination events appear to be of significance to the evolution of HIV-1.
Bayesian hierarchical inference ( HBI ) is proposed as a novel framework for concurrent model comparison, parameter estimation, and inference at the population level. This framework addresses the interdependence between model comparison and parameter estimation, where the relevant population for estimating parameters of a model depends on which subjects express the model. The HBI framework combines previous approaches and has important advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison. The parameters estimated by HBI show smaller errors compared to other methods, and model comparison by HBI is robust against outliers and not biased towards overly simplistic models. The fully Bayesian approach of our theory enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by performing HBI t-tests. The HBI framework is hierarchical in the sense that parameters at the individual level are regularized by statistics across all individuals in the group, and Bayesian in the sense that all uncertainties at both individual and group levels are represented by probability distributions. This work addresses issues of statistical inference over both parameters and models, which have remained elusive with previous hierarchical methods.
In the developing mouse brainstem, rhombomeres ( r ) contribute to the formation of auditory nuclei. Here, we show that r4 is involved in the assembly of functionally linked sensory and motor components of the auditory circuitry, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei ( VCN ), and motor olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of r4-derived auditory components depends on regulatory interactions between Hoxb1 and Hoxb2. In Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 mutant mice, the transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is lost, resulting in hearing impairments. On the other hand, Hoxa2 regulates the Rig1 axon guidance receptor and controls contralateral projections from the anterior VCN to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. Thus, individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem. Interestingly, VCN neurons are also involved in the MEM reflex loop through the action of the facial motor nucleus, originated in ventral r4 and strongly affected in Hoxb1 mutant mice.
The complete genome sequence of the marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 ( Sde 2-40 ) has been reported. This bacterium is a member of a recently discovered group of marine and estuarine bacteria that can recycle complex polysaccharides. The genome sequence of Sde 2-40 reveals an unusually large number of enzymes that can degrade more than 10 different complex polysaccharides. Many of these enzymes exhibit novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules. We hypothesize that these features are adaptations that facilitate the depolymerization of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment. Sde 2-40 is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium that can degrade plant cell walls, an important component of the carbon cycle that is not well-characterized in the marine environment.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes the most significant etiology of childhood viral neurological infections in Asia. In the last 20 years, JEV genotype dominance has shifted from genotype III ( GIII ) to genotype I ( GI ), but the exact mechanism of this displacement is still unknown. Culex pipiens mosquitoes are the most common species in China and play an essential role in maintaining the JEV enzootic transmission cycle. In this study, we used Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China as an in vivo mosquito model to explore if mosquitoes played a potential role in JEV genotype shift. We found that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, dissemination rates, and transmission rates. Our data demonstrated that GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in Cx. pipiens mosquitoes, suggesting that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift. Although the current data were obtained solely from Cx. pipiens mosquitoes, it is likely that the conclusion drawn could be extrapolated to the role of mosquitoes in JEV genotype shift.
Dengue infection is the fastest spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in tropical and subtropical countries. In Malaysia, large dengue outbreaks have occurred in recent years. We conducted a retrospective review of all dengue deaths that occurred nationwide between 2013 and 2014 to study the demographics and clinical characteristics associated with dengue deaths. A total of 322 dengue deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40. 7±19. 30 years, and 72. 5% were adults. Diabetes and hypertension were common co-morbidities among adults and elderly. The most common warning signs reported were lethargy and vomiting, but 22. 4% did not have any warning signs. Only 34% were suspected of dengue illness at their initial presentation. Dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ) contributed to more than 70% of dengue deaths, followed by severe organ involvement ( 69% ) and severe bleeding ( 29. 7% ). DSS was the leading cause of death, regardless of age groups. Dengue deaths occurred primarily in adult patients, and the atypical presentation and dynamic progression of severe dengue in this cohort prompts early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent deaths.
Insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, affects female sexual attractiveness in Drosophila melanogaster. We show that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells, but not in germline cells or early follicle cells, is required for global insulin signaling effects on attractiveness. Manipulations of insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness compared to those caused by global and late follicle cell manipulations, suggesting a competitive relationship between the fat body and the ovary. Insulin signaling in late follicle cells recapitulated effects of global manipulations, and functional ovaries were required for global insulin signaling effects on attractiveness. The cues themselves, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded distinctly to fat body and follicle cell manipulations, indicating independent readouts of the pathway activity from these two tissues. Furthermore, all investigated tissue-specific insulin signaling manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity in the corresponding direction, pointing to insulin pathway activity as a reliable link between fecundity and attractiveness cues.
During the 2013–2015 Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) epidemic in West Africa, the disease spread heterogeneously across the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD, we applied a statistical modelling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number ( R0 ) for each affected district and each country. We used weekly incident case numbers to estimate growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak and fitted a mixed effects model to take into account heterogeneity between and within countries. At district level, R0 ranged from 0. 36 ( Dubréka ) to 1. 72 ( Beyla ) in Guinea, from 0. 53 ( Maryland ) to 3. 37 ( Margibi ) in Liberia, and from 1. 14 ( Koinadugu ) to 2. 73 ( Western Rural ) in Sierra Leone. At national level, we estimated an R0 of 0. 97 ( 95% CI 0. 77–1. 18 ) for Guinea, 1. 26 ( 95% CI 0. 98–1. 55 ) for Liberia, and 1. 66 ( 95% CI 1. 32–2. 00 ) for Sierra Leone. We found that socio-demographic variables related to urbanisation, such as high population density and high wealth index, were positively associated with R0, suggesting that the consequences of fast urban growth in West Africa may have contributed to the increased spread of EVD.
Evolutionary rates of proteins are determined by a combination of intrinsic and historical factors. Here, we investigate the interplay between a protein's age and its structural properties as determinants of evolutionary rate. We use a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins, with mapped PDB structures. We find that previously reported relationships between structural properties and evolutionary rate also hold within each age group. For example, residues with high solvent accessibility evolve more quickly, while proteins with a larger fraction of exposed residues evolve more slowly. However, we also find that the age of a protein modulates the correlation between structural properties and evolutionary rates. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older proteins. We show that previously reported relationships between age and rate cannot be explained by structural biases among age groups. Furthermore, we find that older proteins are more stable for their native structure and more robust to mutations than younger ones.
Polycomb-like 3 ( Pcl3 ) is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) that promotes embryonic stem cell ( ESC ) self-renewal. Pcl3 interacts with Suz12, a core component of PRC2, and promotes the binding of PRC2 to a subset of its genomic targets, particularly CpG islands. We show that Pcl3 knockdown in ESCs increases spontaneous differentiation and reduces H3K27me3 levels, while overexpression of Pcl3 increases H3K27me3 levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) reveal that Pcl3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of Pcl3 decreases Suz12 binding at over 60% of PRC2 targets. The Tudor domain of Pcl3 is essential for its function, as mutation of conserved residues within this domain compromises H3K27me3 formation. We also show that Pcl3 and its paralog, Pcl2, exist in different PRC2 complexes but bind many of the same PRC2 targets, particularly CpG islands regulated by Pcl3. Thus, Pcl3 is a critical component of PRC2 that regulates ESC self-renewal, histone methylation, and recruitment of PRC2 to a subset of its genomic sites.
Chemoreceptor gene expression in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms involving the transcription factors MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix ( bHLH ). We show that MEF-2 acts together with bHLH transcription factors to regulate the expression of the chemoreceptor gene srh-234 in the ADL sensory neuron of C. elegans as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory MEF2 binding site is necessary and sufficient for the starvation-induced down regulation of srh-234 expression, while an E-box site is required to drive srh-234 expression in ADL neurons. The bHLH transcription factors HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4 act in ADL neurons to regulate srh-234 expression. Furthermore, we show that the expression levels of srh-234 in ADL neurons are regulated remotely by the transcription factors MXL-3 and HLH-30 acting in the intestine, which is dependent on insulin signaling functioning specifically in ADL neurons. This non-cell-autonomous regulation involves a subset of insulin-like peptides.
Mycobacterium ulcerans is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer ( BU ), a destructive skin condition. The mode of transmission of M. ulcerans is not well understood, but several studies have suggested that biting insects may play a role. In this study, we investigated the association between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of BU disease in humans in an endemic area of southeastern Australia. Mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, Australia, from 2004 to 2009 and screened for M. ulcerans by real-time PCR. We found a strong dose-response relationship between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease ( r, 0. 99; 95% CI, 0. 92–0. 99; p<0. 001 ). The proportion of M. ulcerans-positive mosquitoes in each town was positively correlated with the average cumulative incidence of BU in the same location. The association was strongest in Point Lonsdale and Barwon Heads, which had the highest incidences of BU and the highest proportions of M. ulcerans-positive mosquitoes. These findings strengthen the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the transmission of M. ulcerans in southeastern Australia and have implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent BU.
Demyelination in the central nervous system ( CNS ) of dmy/dmy rats results from a loss-of-function mutation in the Mrs2 gene, which encodes an essential component of the major Mg2+ influx system in mitochondria. By positional cloning, we identified a novel splice acceptor site generated by a G-to-A transition 177 bp downstream of exon 3 of the Mrs2 gene, resulting in functional inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA validated our findings. We showed that dmy/dmy rats have major mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, a 60% reduction in ATP, and increased numbers of mitochondria in the swollen cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes. MRS2-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed that MRS2 was dominantly expressed in neurons rather than oligodendrocytes and was ultrastructurally observed in the inner membrane of mitochondria. Our observations led to the conclusion that dmy/dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease and that the maintenance of myelin has a different mechanism from its initial production. We also established that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for the maintenance of myelin.
Microarray gene expression signatures have the potential to improve diagnosis and prognosis of disease. However, current documentation standards of such signatures do not allow for an unambiguous application to study-external patients. This hinders independent evaluation and delays the use of signatures in clinical practice. We analyzed data from eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and evaluated the consistency of study-internal with study-external diagnoses. Study-external classifications were based on documented information only. We found that discrepancies between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as frequent as 30% ( worst case ) and 18% ( median ). By using the proposed documentation by value strategy, which documents quantitative preprocessing information, the median discrepancy was reduced to 1%. We propose guidelines and methodology for building and documenting signatures unambiguously to improve the process of evaluating microarray gene expression diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice.
Curli amyloid fibrils, secreted by Enterobacteriaceae, play a key role in host cell adhesion and biofilm formation, thereby promoting bacterial resistance to environmental stressors. Here, we present crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, CsgA, revealing steric zipper fibrils of tightly mated β-sheets. These structures demonstrate a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids, such as Alzheimer’s disease-associated amyloid-β. We show that D-enantiomeric peptides, originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer’s disease-associated amyloid-β, inhibit CsgA fibrillation and reduce biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CsgA fibrils cross-seed fibrillation of amyloid-β, providing support for the proposed structural resemblance and potential for cross-species amyloid interactions.
Japanese encephalitis virus ( JEV ) is an important cause of encephalitis in most of Asia, with high case fatality rates and significant neurologic sequelae among survivors. The epidemiology of JE in the Philippines is not well defined. We conducted a systematic literature review and summarized JE surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 to support consideration of JE vaccine for introduction into the national schedule in the Philippines. We identified 29 published reports and presentations on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 reports of clinical cases, and 8 animal studies. The 18 clinical studies reported 257 cases of laboratory-confirmed JE from 1972 to 2013. JE virus ( JEV ) was the causative agent in 7% to 18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16% to 40% of clinical encephalitis cases. JE predominantly affected children under 15 years of age and 6% to 7% of cases resulted in death. Surveillance data from January 2011 to March 2014 identified 73 ( 15% ) laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 cases tested. This review demonstrates the endemicity and extensive geographic range of JE in the Philippines, and supports the use of JE vaccine in the country. Continued and improved surveillance with laboratory confirmation is needed to systematically quantify the burden of JE, to provide information that can guide prioritization of high risk areas in the country and determination of appropriate age and schedule of vaccine introduction, and to measure the impact of preventive measures including immunization against this important public health threat.
Genetic robustness, the ability of a species to endure genetic perturbations, is still under debate as to whether it arises from environmental requirements, intrinsic factors, or adaptive selection. Here, we study the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in hundreds of bacterial species across many simulated growth environments. We decouple genetic robustness into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent robustness. Environmental-dependent robustness is responsible for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle ( specialized or generalist ). In contrast, environmental-independent robustness is associated with a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities, with higher robustness observed in fast growers or organisms with extensive secondary metabolite production. We also identify reactions uniquely susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens, potentially serving as novel drug targets.
Schistosoma mansoni infection is associated with immune modulation that can influence responses to non-schistosome antigens. We investigated the effect of S. mansoni infection on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunisation and the effect of praziquantel treatment on this outcome in a randomised trial. The Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunisation ( IMoChI ) study was based in Entebbe, Uganda. Children aged 3–5 years ( 193 S. mansoni-infected and 61 uninfected ) were enrolled. Infected children were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive praziquantel 2 weeks before, at time of, or 1 week after, measles catch-up immunisation. Plasma anti-measles IgG was measured at enrolment, 1 week and 24 weeks after measles immunisation. We found that S. mansoni-infected children had lower levels of anti-measles IgG at 1 week post-immunisation compared to uninfected children ( adjusted geometric mean ratio ( aGMR ) 0. 4 [95% CI 0. 2–0. 7] ). Among S. mansoni-infected children, anti-measles IgG one week post-immunisation was higher among those treated with praziquantel than among those who were not yet treated ( treatment before immunisation, aGMR 2. 3 [1. 5–4. 8]; treatment at immunisation aGMR 1. 8 [1. 1–3. 5] ). At 24 weeks post-immunisation, IgG levels did not differ between the trial groups, but tended to be lower among previously-infected children who were still S mansoni stool-positive than among those who became stool-negative. Our findings suggest that S. mansoni infection among pre-school children is associated with a reduced antibody response to catch-up measles immunisation, and that praziquantel treatment improves the response.
The evolution of bacterial populations has become better understood with the advent of large-scale sequencing of population samples. However, traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, are associated with several difficulties under an extensive sampling scenario, in particular when a considerable amount of recombination is anticipated to have taken place. To meet the needs of large-scale analyses of population structure for bacteria, we introduce here several statistical tools for the detection and representation of recombination between populations. We also introduce a model-based description of the shape of a population in sequence space, in terms of its molecular variability and affinity towards other populations. We demonstrate the potential of an approach where these population genetic tools are combined with phylogenetic analysis using extensive real data from the genus Neisseria. The statistical tools introduced here are freely available in BAPS 5. 2 software, which can be downloaded from http://web. abo. fi/fak/mnf/mate/jc/software/baps. html. We illustrate the levels of complexity at which our methods can operate using a population sample of 5086 strains that have been identified as Neisseria meningiditis and Neisseria lactamica species.
Top-down beta rhythms have been shown to play a crucial role in supporting selective attention via interlaminar interaction. These rhythms are generated in higher cognitive areas and delivered to earlier sensory areas to modulate attentional gain. To elucidate the functional roles of beta rhythms and their underlying mechanisms, we built a computational model of sensory cortical areas. Our simulation results show that top-down beta rhythms can activate ascending synaptic projections from layer 5 ( L5 ) to layer 4 ( L4 ) and layer 2/3 ( L2/3 ), responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons in L5 are shown to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate the activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. This provides a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention. Our results suggest that top-down beta rhythms can enhance gamma rhythms in L2/3, reduce beta rhythms in L2/3, and enhance spiking activity of L2/3 regular spiking ( RS ) cells. This is consistent with the pattern of neural response modulation induced by attention reported in previous studies.
Stochastic transmission dynamic models are useful for studying the early emergence of novel pathogens. However, methods for parameter estimation and prediction for these types of stochastic models remain limited. We describe a calibration and prediction framework for stochastic compartmental transmission models of epidemics. The proposed method, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems ( MSS ), applies a linear noise approximation to describe the size of the fluctuations, and uses each new surveillance observation to update the belief about the true epidemic state. We evaluate the accuracy of MSS for real-time parameter estimation and prediction during epidemics using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen. We assume that weekly counts for the number of new diagnosed cases are available and serve as an imperfect proxy of incidence. MSS produces accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters ( i. e. mean duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff ) and can provide an accurate estimate of the unobserved number of infectious individuals during the course of an epidemic. MSS also allows for accurate prediction of the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. We compare the performance of MSS to three state-of-the-art benchmark methods and find that MSS significantly outperforms each of these methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested.
Visual perception is shaped by two contrasting forces: a repulsive force exerted by sensory adaptation and an attractive force exerted by past decisions. In a series of experiments, we used multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. Our results revealed that each perceptual report is permeated by opposite biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes: low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional traces attract perceptual reports toward the recent past. This finding is consistent with a Two-process model of serial dependence in which the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. We propose a unified account of serial dependence in which functionally distinct mechanisms, operating at different stages, promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time.
In Drosophila, the Clock–Cycle ( CLK–CYC ) heterodimer is a key component of the circadian transcription complex. We have analyzed the effects of a CYC–viral protein 16 ( VP16 ) fusion protein in the Drosophila system to address the role of transcription in core circadian timekeeping. The addition of VP16 to CYC imparts strongly enhanced transcriptional activity to the CLK–CYC-VP16 complex relative to the normal CLK–CYC heterodimer. This increase in transcriptional activity is manifested in flies expressing CYC-VP16 as well as in S2 cells. These flies have increased levels of CLK–CYC direct target gene mRNAs, including those from per and tim, and a short period, implicating circadian transcription in period determination. Importantly, the behavioral effects require a period ( per ) promoter and are therefore unlikely to be merely a consequence of generally higher PER levels. This indicates that the CLK–CYC-VP16 behavioral effects are a consequence of increased per transcription. Our results suggest that the timing of transcriptional activation and not the activation itself is the key event responsible for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies. The results taken together indicate that circadian transcription contributes to core circadian function in Drosophila.
The PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica and the closely related bacterium Escherichia coli plays a key role in conferring polymyxin B resistance. The pmrD gene, which is horizontally acquired, activates the PmrA/PmrB system in Salmonella but not in E. coli. We show that the Salmonella PmrD protein binds to the phosphorylated PmrA protein ( PmrA-P ) and protects it from dephosphorylation by the PmrB protein, resulting in the transcription of PmrA-dependent genes. In contrast, the E. coli PmrD protein cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli. However, we found that the E. coli PmrD protein can activate the PmrA/PmrB system in Salmonella, suggesting that E. coli and Salmonella differ in an additional component controlling PmrA-P levels. We established that the E. coli PmrB protein displays higher phosphatase activity towards PmrA-P than the Salmonella PmrB protein. We identified a PmrB subdomain responsible for this property and showed that replacement of the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog was sufficient to render E. coli resistant to polymyxin B under PmrD-inducing conditions.
The differentiation of embryonic stem cells is initiated by a gradual loss of pluripotency-associated transcripts and induction of differentiation genes. To identify the causal genes that either promote or inhibit differentiation, we need to detect differentially expressed genes at the early stages of differentiation. However, previous methods of identifying differentially expressed genes by comparing different cell types inevitably include a large portion of genes that respond to, rather than regulate, the differentiation process. Here, we demonstrate that the gene expression data obtained without prior separation of cell types are informative for detecting differentially expressed genes at the early stages of differentiation. We propose a novel statistical approach, called the Differentiation-Test, to analyze the differentiation process. This method assumes that the differentiation process starts from a relatively homogeneous initial cell mixture and progresses into a more heterogeneous cell mixture with identifiable events of divergence of expression levels of certain genes during the process. We apply the Differentiation-Test to study the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into embryoid bodies and identify Smarcad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal.
Next-generation sequencing studies often rely on groupwise functional analysis of gene variants. However, the function of many genes is unknown, and their classification to pathways is limited. As a result, functional associations between genes are often inferred from large-scale omics data, such as protein–protein interactions and gene co-expression networks. Statistical significance is assessed by comparing the interconnectedness of mutated genes with that of random gene sets. However, interconnectedness can be affected by confounding bias, potentially resulting in false positive findings. We show that genes implicated through de novo sequence variants are biased in their coding-sequence length and tend to cluster together, leading to exaggerated p-values in functional studies. To address this bias, we present an integrative method that controls for the confounding bias in coding-sequence length. We have inferred functional associations between human genes from diverse data types and assessed them with a novel phenotype-based method. Examining the functional association between de novo gene variants, we find that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. We present a tool that identifies functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias.
The Mexican government implemented an 8% tax on nonessential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100 g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages ( SSBs ) in January 2014 to combat obesity and diabetes. This study evaluates the impact of these taxes on the volume of taxed and untaxed packaged food purchases in the Mexican urban population. Using data from The Nielsen Company’s Mexico Consumer Panel Services ( CPS ), we included 6, 248 households that participated in the Nielsen CPS in at least 2 mo during 2012–2014. We analyzed the volume of purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014, using a longitudinal, fixed-effects model that adjusted for preexisting trends. We found that the mean volume of purchases of taxed foods in 2014 changed by -25 g ( 95% confidence interval = -46, -11 ) per capita per month, or a 5. 1% change beyond what would have been expected based on pre-tax ( 2012–2013 ) trends, with no corresponding change in purchases of untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased on average 10. 2% less taxed foods than expected ( -44 [–72, –16] g per capita per month ) ; medium SES households purchased 5. 8% less taxed foods than expected ( -28 [–46, –11] g per capita per month ), whereas high SES households’ purchases did not change.
The response properties of collision-sensitive neurons, such as the Lobula Giant Movement Detector Neuron ( LGMD ) of the locust, can be explained by a biophysically plausible model. The LGMD responds best to objects approaching one of the locust’s compound eyes on a direct collision course. We present a new model ( “n-ψ” ) for the LGMD and other collision-sensitive neurons with η-like response properties. The n-ψ model is based on its predecessor model Ψ, which used an exact power law for re-scaling the inhibitory input. The n-ψ model assumes that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. As a result, an approximative power law is obtained as a result of pooling these channels. We show that the n-ψ model can successfully predict many response characteristics of the LGMD. The results depend critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway, but are fairly robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The integration process, or pooling, could be carried out by the dendritic tree of the LGMD neuron. The only preconditions for each channel are the presence of noise ( uncorrelated across channels ), and a response threshold.
Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a neglected tropical disease endemic in Cameroon. The national BU control programme ( NBUCP ) was established in 2002, 33 years after the first cases were reported in 1969. We describe the evolution, achievements, and challenges of the NBUCP from 2001 to 2014. The programme aims to detect cases early, confirm 70% of clinical cases by PCR, treat all active cases according to standard guidelines, and heal at least 95% of patients without limitation of joint movement. Over 14 years, 3700 cases were notified, and the BU detection rate dropped significantly from 3. 89 to 1. 45 per 100 000 inhabitants. The number of BU endemic health districts rose from two to 64, and five BU diagnostic and treatment centres are functional, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and BU research and education have gained more interest in Cameroon. However, the reduction in programme resources and activities by major support partners has led to a steady drop in performance indicators since 2010.
In two experiments, we investigated the effect of outcome valence ( gains or losses ) on confidence while participants learned stimulus-outcome associations by trial-and-error in a reinforcement-learning task. We found that participants were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. Computational modelling revealed that this bias is driven by the context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average expected-value of choice options, necessary to explain equal performance in the gain and loss domain. This biasing effect of context-value on confidence is domain-general and likely has important functional consequences. We show that one such consequence emerges in volatile environments, where the flexibility of individuals’ learning strategies differs when outcomes are framed as gains or losses.
Alphaviruses are a family of positive-strand RNA viruses that cause diseases such as Chikungunya, Sindbis, and Semliki Forest virus ( SFV ) in humans and animals. Among the four non-structural proteins of alphaviruses, the function of nsP3 is the least well understood. We found that the carboxyterminal region of nsP3 contains a conserved proline-rich sequence motif that serves as a preferred target site for the Src-homology 3 ( SH3 ) domains of amphiphysin-1 and -2. Amphiphysins are host cell proteins that are involved in endocytosis and membrane trafficking. We found that nsP3 proteins of SFV, SINV, and Chikungunya viruses all showed avid and SH3-dependent binding to amphiphysins. Upon alphavirus infection, the intracellular distribution of amphiphysin was dramatically altered and colocalized with nsP3. We found that mutations in nsP3 disrupting the amphiphysin SH3 binding motif as well as RNAi-mediated silencing of amphiphysin-2 expression resulted in impaired viral RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SFV. Infection of Balb/c mice with SFV carrying an SH3 binding-defective nsP3 was associated with significantly decreased mortality. These data establish SH3 domain-mediated binding of nsP3 with amphiphysin as an important host cell interaction promoting alphavirus replication.
Chromoblastomycosis is a mutilating disease caused by melanized members of the order Chaetothyriales. We analyzed 123 clinical strains from cases of chromoblastomycosis from different endemic areas in Brazil to assess population diversity among agents of the disease. We applied sequencing of the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region and partial cell division cycle and β-tubulin genes. The strains were limited to three clusters within the single family Herpotrichiellaceae, which comprises agents of chromoblastomycosis. The Fonsecaea cluster contained the most important agents, with Fonsecaea pedrosoi being the most prevalent ( 80% of the total set of strains ), followed by Fonsecaea monophora ( 13% ), Fonsecaea nubica ( 3% ), and a single isolate of Fonsecaea pugnacius. In addition, we identified two novel species among members of the genera Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora, with frequencies of 3% and 1%, respectively. The Brazilian clinical isolates were all derived from humid climate zones, and members of the Cladophialophora carrionii group were not encountered.
Listeria monocytogenes dampens the host DNA damage response ( DDR ) by inducing DNA breaks in host cells while controlling the activation of the DDR. We show that infection with L. monocytogenes induces DNA breaks and activates the DDR in host cells in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, L. monocytogenes is able to dampen activation of the DNA-damage signaling pathway through the bacterial factor listeriolysin O ( LLO ). LLO induces the degradation of the host protein Mre11, one of the major sensors of DNA damage, through a mechanism independent of proteasome degradation. This dampening of the DDR is important for infection as inhibition of proteins implicated in this pathway increases bacterial infection. We show that deletion or inhibition of proteins involved in the DDR leads to higher levels of infection, demonstrating for the first time that the DDR can be a negative regulator of a bacterial infection.
Human herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 ( HSV-1 and HSV-2 ) are common pathogens that cause human diseases. Both host and viral factors are involved in HSV lytic infection, but the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. We identified bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) as a critical player in HSV infection by screening a chemical library of epigenetic regulation. We found that treatment with a pan BD domain inhibitor enhanced both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection. Using JQ1 as a probe, we found that JQ1, a defined BD1 inhibitor, acts through BRD4 protein since knockdown of BRD4 expression ablated JQ1 effect on HSV infection. BRD4 regulates HSV replication through complex formation involving CDK9 and RNAP II; whereas, JQ1 promotes HSV-1 infection by allocating the complex to HSV gene promoters. Our data support a model that JQ1 enhances HSV infection by switching BRD4 to transcription regulation of viral gene expression from chromatin targeting. In addition to the identification that BRD4 is a modulator for JQ1 action on HSV infection, this study demonstrates BRD4 has an essential role in HSV infection.
Noma, also known as cancrum oris, is an ancient and devastating illness that causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140, 000 malnourished children every year. The exact cause of noma is still unknown, but it is thought to result from a combination of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and a weakened immune system. To better understand the microbial ecology of noma, we performed a cross-sectional sequencing study of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from sixty samples of gingival fluid from twelve healthy children, twelve children suffering from noma, twelve children suffering from Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis ( ANG ), and twelve healthy controls. We found that noma lesions were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted for Proteobacteria compared to healthy individuals. In contrast, samples from healthy sites of diseased mouths had similar proportions of Spirochaetes and Proteobacteria to healthy controls. We also found that the microbial communities in noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU, which was much less abundant in healthy sites sampled from the same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed that bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different. Several OTUs in the Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales were identified as indicators of noma, suggesting that one or more microbes within these Orders is associated with the development of noma lesions.
Bacillus thuringiensis, a Gram-positive bacterium, uses quorum sensing to coordinate its adaptation properties, cell fate, and commitment to sporulation. The NprR-NprX regulation system is a typical Gram-positive quorum-sensing system in which NprX is the signaling peptide. In the presence of NprX, NprR acts as a transcriptional activator, regulating a set of genes involved in the necrotrophic lifestyle of B. thuringiensis, allowing the bacterium to survive in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of NprX and independently of its transcriptional activator function, NprR negatively controls sporulation. NprR inhibits the expression of Spo0A-regulated genes by preventing the KinA-dependent phosphorylation of the phosphotransferase Spo0F, thus delaying the initiation of the sporulation process. This function of NprR displays similarities with the Rap proteins, which also belong to the RNPP family, but are devoid of a DNA-binding domain and indirectly control gene expression via protein-protein interactions. The crystal structure of apo NprR confirms that NprR displays a highly flexible Rap-like structure. We propose a molecular regulatory mechanism in which key residues of the bifunctional regulator NprR are directly and alternatively involved in its two functions. NprX binding switches NprR from a dimeric inhibitor of sporulation to a tetrameric transcriptional activator involved in the necrotrophic lifestyle of B. thuringiensis. NprR thus tightly coordinates sporulation and necrotrophism, ensuring survival and dissemination of the bacteria during host infection.
Proteochemometric ( PCM ) models have been developed to predict the efficacy of antiretroviral ( ARV ) drugs against HIV by combining chemical and protein target properties in a single bioactivity model. These models are based on a large-scale clinical database of genotypic and phenotypic information, containing over 300, 000 drug-mutant bioactivity data points. Our models achieved a prediction error below 0. 5 Log Fold Change and outperformed previously published sequence-based models in resistance classification and prediction of Log Fold Change ( 0. 76 log units versus 0. 91 ). We were able to identify known and novel resistance-conferring mutations of HIV Reverse Transcriptase ( e. g. K102Y, T216M ) and HIV Protease ( e. g. Q18N, N88G ) from our dataset. We applied our models prospectively to the public HIV resistance database from Stanford University and obtained a correct resistance prediction rate of 84% on the full set, compared to 80% in previous work on a high quality subset. We conclude that PCM models are able to accurately predict phenotypic resistance based on genotypic data even for novel mutants and mixtures. Furthermore, we add an applicability domain to the prediction, informing the user about the reliability of predictions.
Chemotaxis in eukaryotic cells has been extensively studied, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We recently proposed an alternative mechanism of chemotaxis in which pseudopods are formed by a self-generated cycle rather than by actin polymerization caused by chemoattractants. To test the explanatory and predictive powers of this mechanism, we developed a computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudopod autocatalysis. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data about cell movement and chemotaxis, including cell polarization and persistence without stimuli, selection of accurate pseudopods when chemoattractant gradients are present, and bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients. The model also predicts lateral pseudopod initiation in high gradients, a phenomenon not previously observed. We tested the predictive ability of the model by measuring the angles between successive pseudopods in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells under different conditions and found that the results agreed with the model extremely well. Our model and data together suggest that in rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils, an intrinsic pseudopod cycle lies at the heart of cell motility. This implies that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on modification of intrinsic pseudopod behaviour rather than generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants.
Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, can be transmitted by fleas through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission ( EPT ) and biofilm-dependent transmission ( BDT ). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and is influenced by the species of rodent blood used for the infectious blood meal. In this study, fleas were fed bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, or gerbils, and the location and characteristics of the infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pestis were assessed 1 to 3 days after infection. We observed that fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood frequently regurgitated a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 h of feeding, a phenomenon we term post-infection esophageal reflux ( PIER ). In contrast, PIER was rarely observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with the accumulation of a dense mixed aggregate of Y. pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals that filled the proventriculus. At their next feeding, fleas with PIER were 3–25 times more likely to appear partially blocked, with fresh blood retained within the esophagus, than were fleas without PIER. Our data support a model in which EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut and that EPT and BDT can sometimes temporally overlap.
Positive correlations between the activity of neurons in the brain have been shown to be detrimental to the fidelity of population codes, or at best marginally favorable compared to independent codes. However, we show that positive correlations can enhance coding performance by many orders of magnitude. Specifically, the probability of discrimination error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude, and the number of stimuli encoded—the capacity—can be enhanced more than tenfold. These effects can occur for populations with a few tens of neurons and do not necessitate unrealistic correlation values. We further show that both effects benefit from heterogeneity commonly seen in population activity. We demonstrate that a class of patterns of positive correlation can suppress coding errors in a two-alternative discrimination task, and that the advantageous role of heterogeneity seems to be a rather general feature of population coding. We refer to the phenomenon in which neural correlation suppresses the discrimination errors to negligible values and dramatically boosts the capacity of a population as high-fidelity coding. We exploit the idea that correlation can enhance coding performance by relegating the variability of neural response into non-informative modes of the population activity.
Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, and protection against cholera is serogroup specific. Here, we report the development of a conjugate vaccine for cholera that targets the O-specific polysaccharide ( OSP ) of V. cholerae O1 Inaba. The vaccine is composed of the OSP of V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain PIC018 and a recombinant heavy chain fragment of tetanus toxin ( OSP:rTTHc ). We assessed a range of vaccine doses ( 10-50 μg ), vaccine compositions varying by molar loading ratio of OSP to rTTHc ( 3:1, 5:1, 10:1 ), effect of an adjuvant, and route of immunization. Immunized mice developed prominent anti-OSP and anti-TT serum IgG responses, as well as vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses following intramuscular or intradermal vaccination. Intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses targeting OSP occurred following intradermal vaccination. We found comparable immune responses in mice immunized with these variations, although memory B cell and vibriocidal responses were blunted in mice receiving the highest dose of vaccine ( 50 μg ). We found no appreciable change in immune responses when the conjugate vaccine was administered in the presence or absence of immunoadjuvant alum. Administration of OSP:rTTHc resulted in 55% protective efficacy in a mouse survival cholera challenge model. We report development of an Inaba OSP:rTTHc conjugate vaccine that induces memory responses and protection against cholera in mice.
Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) is a disease caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti. The ICT card test is a tool used to map the distribution of LF in endemic areas. However, in areas with high levels of Loa loa ( L. loa ) microfilaria ( Mf ), the ICT test may produce false positive results due to cross-reactivity with L. loa. In this study, we investigated the cross-reactivity of the ICT test in areas with contrasting levels of L. loa and Mansonella perstans ( M. perstans ) endemicity in Cameroon. We conducted a cross-sectional study in 42 villages across three regions of the Cameroon rainforest domain, assessing the prevalence and intensity of W. bancrofti, L. loa, and M. perstans. We found that the ICT test was strongly associated with high L. loa Mf intensity, with 21 subjects having more than 8, 000 L. loa Mf/ml of blood. We also observed a strong positive association between the prevalence of L. loa and ICT positivity by area, with a rate of 1% or more of positive ICT results found only in areas with an L. loa Mf prevalence above 15%. In contrast, there was no association between ICT positivity and M. perstans prevalence or Mf density. These results suggest that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results is high levels of L. loa.
Positive-strand RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, replicate in the cytoplasm of infected host cells. Their replication complexes are commonly associated with modified host cell membranes, which can range from distinct spherular membrane invaginations to elaborate networks of membranes and vesicles. The ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and exact role of these structures in viral replication remain poorly defined. We have used electron tomography of cryofixed infected cells to define a unique reticulovesicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that integrates convoluted membranes, numerous interconnected double-membrane vesicles ( DMVs ), and “vesicle packets” arising from DMV merger. The convoluted membranes were most abundantly immunolabeled for viral replicase subunits. However, double-stranded RNA, presumably revealing the site of viral RNA synthesis, mainly localized to the DMV interior. Our analysis raises several questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. Our data document the extensive virus-induced reorganization of host cell membranes into a network that is used to organize viral replication and possibly hide replicating RNA from antiviral defense mechanisms.
Arabidopsis thaliana is a model organism used to study the role of suberin in plant roots. Suberin is a waxy, hydrophobic compound that has been hypothesized to form an extracellular barrier limiting the apoplastic transport of water and solutes in plant roots. Here, we present direct genetic evidence that suberin in the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana plays a critical role in controlling both water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves. Using the newly characterized enhanced suberin1 ( esb1 ) mutant, we established a connection between suberin in the root and both water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in the shoot. Esb1 mutants, characterized by increased root suberin, were found to have reduced daytime transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during their vegetative growth period. Furthermore, these changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreases in the accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn and increases in the accumulation of Na, S, K, As, Se, and Mo in the shoot.
The kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating recovery and reproducibility of rod photoresponse have been investigated using a Continuous Time Markov Chain ( CTMC ) model. The model is based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation and is interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model parameters are extracted from the photoresponse data of both wild type and mutant mice with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites. The model reproduces both wild type and mutant responses with the same set of parameters. The sources of variability are dissected into their components, and the results show that only the randomness of the sojourn times in each of the phosphorylated states contributes to the Coefficient of Variation ( CV ) of the response, whereas the randomness of the number of R* turnoff steps has a negligible effect. These results counter the view that the larger the number of decay steps of R*, the more stable the photoresponse is. Our results indicate that R* shutoff is responsible for the variability of the photoresponse, while the diffusion of the second messengers acts as a variability suppressor.
In this work, we develop a general mathematical framework to uncouple the dynamics of a stochastic reaction network from its fluctuating extrinsic environment. This is achieved by marginalizing the system dynamics with respect to the extrinsic fluctuations, resulting in a decoupled model that summarizes all system behaviors attainable under all possible realizations of the extrinsic noise. The decoupled dynamics provide a novel analytical tool to study how environmental stochasticity is propagated along coupled reaction networks. We show that the total environmental noise splits up into two terms: one corresponding to the noise that is suppressed and a second term that quantifies the effective noise that is sensed by the target network. In the context of Monte Carlo simulation, the decoupled process can yield a significant reduction in computational effort when compared to standard SSA, especially if the environmental network is costly to simulate. We describe the time-evolution of a stochastic reaction network by a continuous-time Markov chain ( CTMC ) with chemical species and reaction channels. The system state at time is denoted and we write its random path on time intervals as. We derive the corresponding process- and master equations for the decoupled model and show how stochastic simulations can be performed.
A novel closed-loop brain-machine interface ( BMI ) training architecture has been developed that enables robust control and extends to various tasks. The architecture, termed adaptive optimal feedback-controlled ( OFC ) point process filter ( PPF ), incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model of the brain’s behavior in closed-loop BMI control and a point process model of spikes. The OFC model infers the user’s motor intention during closed-loop decoder adaptation ( CLDA ) and is used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders. We conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to dissociate the effects of these novel CLDA components. The OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared with current intention estimation techniques. OFC assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control. Spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared with batch-based methods, and was robust to parameter initialization. Finally, the architecture extended control to tasks beyond those used for CLDA training.
Retinal ganglion cells in the mammalian retina respond to a wide range of stimuli with varying degrees of spatial and temporal correlations. To investigate the effect of stimulus structure on redundancy in retinal responses, we measured simultaneous responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells presented with natural and artificial stimuli that varied greatly in correlation structure. We found that responding to spatio-temporally structured stimuli such as natural movies, pairs of ganglion cells were modestly more correlated than in response to white noise checkerboards, but they were much less correlated than predicted by a non-adapting functional model of retinal response. Meanwhile, responding to stimuli with purely spatial correlations, pairs of ganglion cells showed increased correlations consistent with a static, non-adapting receptive field and nonlinearity. We found that in response to spatio-temporally correlated stimuli, ganglion cells had faster temporal kernels and tended to have stronger surrounds. These properties of individual cells, along with gain changes that opposed changes in effective contrast at the ganglion cell input, largely explained the pattern of pairwise correlations across stimuli where receptive field measurements were possible.
Synthetic lethal ( SL ) interactions occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. These interactions are important for predicting function, dissecting protein complexes into functional pathways, and exploring the mechanistic underpinnings of common human diseases. However, only a small proportion of gene pairs have been tested for genetic interactions due to the large number of possible combinations of gene pairs. To expand the set of known SL interactions, we have devised an integrative, multi-network approach for predicting these interactions that significantly improves upon the existing approaches. We defined a large number of features for characterizing the relationships between pairs of genes from various data sources. These features are independent of the known SL interactions, in contrast to some previous approaches. We developed a non-parametric multi-classifier system for predicting SL interactions that enabled the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures. Using this approach, we derived the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network, part of which was well supported by literature. We also used this approach to predict SL interactions between all non-essential gene pairs in yeast. This integrative approach is expected to be more effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions from the tens of millions of unknown gene pairs in yeast and from the hundreds of millions of gene pairs in higher organisms like mouse and human, in which very few genetic interactions have been identified to date.
The BRCA Challenge is a global data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ( GA4GH ) to aggregate data on BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants. The project aims to generate a comprehensive understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk in these genes. The BRCA Exchange, a newly created web portal ( www. brcaexchange. org ), aggregates over 20, 000 reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2, three times the number found in the next-largest public database at the project’s outset. Approximately 7, 250 of these variants have expert classifications. The data set is based on shared information from existing clinical databases, including the Breast Cancer Information Core ( BIC ), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database ( LOVD ), as well as population databases. The BRCA Challenge has brought together experts from the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles ( ENIGMA ) consortium, clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers to advance our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. The project pioneers the hypothesis-free linkage of molecular variants with electronic patient records to build an unbiased prospective knowledge base of cancer predisposition. The BRCA Challenge represents an important step in the sharing and collaborative annotation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants to advance human health globally.
Malaria, caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium, is a major threat to human health and welfare. In order to deal with high fluxes of reactive oxygen species and maintain redox regulatory processes and pathogenicity, Plasmodium depends upon an adequate redox balance. By systematically studying the subcellular localization of the major antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins, we obtained the first complete map of redox compartmentation in Plasmodium falciparum. We demonstrate the targeting of two plasmodial peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase system to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. Furthermore, we obtained a complete picture of the compartmentation of thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-like proteins. Notably, for the two major antioxidant redox-enzymes – glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase – Plasmodium makes use of alternative-translation-initiation ( ATI ) to achieve differential targeting. Our study provides the first comprehensive picture of the subcellular compartmentation of cellular redox metabolism in malaria parasites. The apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid of Plasmodium, harbours indispensable plant-like metabolic pathways including fatty-acid and haem biosynthesis.
PUMA is an intrinsically disordered protein that binds to its cellular partner Mcl-1 through its BH3 motif, which folds into an α helix upon binding. We have used a structure-based coarse-grained model to investigate the role of electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding of PUMA with Mcl-1. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity, and was shown to be consistent with previously published experimental data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength. Our results suggest that intramolecular electrostatic interactions have a marginal influence on the unbound states of PUMA. However, we find that intermolecular electrostatic interactions, and in particular non-native electrostatic interactions, are involved in the formation of the initial encounter complex between PUMA and Mcl-1. Our simulations indicate that the binding process is accelerated by electrostatic interactions, and that association rates decrease at higher ionic strengths where charges are more efficiently screened from each other and electrostatic interactions are weakened.
Polycomb group ( PcG ) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain silencing of key developmental genes outside of their expression domains. Here, we studied the nuclear distribution of two PcG proteins, PC and Polyhomeotic ( PH ), during fly embryogenesis. Using a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins, we analyzed the formation and motion of PC bodies, which are nuclear structures containing PcG-silenced genes. We found that PC bodies mainly correspond to 3D structural counterparts of the linear genomic domains identified in genome-wide studies. During early embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate within PC bodies, which form nuclear structures localized on distinct euchromatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis indicates that two types of motion influence the displacement of PC bodies and chromatin domains containing H2Av-GFP. First, chromatin domains and PC bodies coordinately undergo long-range motions that may correspond to the movement of whole chromosome territories. Second, each PC body and chromatin domain has its own fast and highly constrained motion. The fast motion of PC bodies and chromatin domains observed during early embryogenesis strongly decreases in late developmental stages, indicating a possible contribution of chromatin dynamics in the maintenance of stable gene silencing.
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) mutations are implicated in the aging process, but there is no universally accepted method for their accurate quantification. We have used ultra-deep sequencing to study genome-wide mtDNA mutation load in the liver of normally- and prematurely-aging mice. Mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing a proof-reading–deficient mtDNA polymerase ( mtDNA mutator mice ) have 10-times-higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. In addition, the mtDNA mutator mice have increased levels of a truncated linear mtDNA molecule, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region. In contrast, circular mtDNA molecules with large deletions occur at extremely low frequencies in mtDNA mutator mice and can therefore not drive the premature aging phenotype. Sequence analysis shows that the main proportion of the mutation load in heterozygous mtDNA mutator mice and their wildtype siblings is inherited from their heterozygous mothers consistent with germline transmission. We found no increase in levels of point mutations or deletions in wildtype C57Bl/6N mice with increasing age, thus questioning the causative role of these changes in aging. Our results from studies of mice thus indicate that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development and do not result from damage accumulation in adult life.
The F1Fo-ATP synthase from the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum has been shown to be directly coupled to ATP synthesis via a novel Na+ recognition motif. This motif is shared by other human pathogens and is characterized by a two-carboxylate ion-coupling motif. Molecular modeling and free-energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to the Na+ ionophore monensin. Furthermore, Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites, both in the complete ATP synthase and the isolated c-ring. Definitive evidence of Na+ coupling is provided by two identical crystal structures of the c11 ring, solved by X-ray crystallography at 2. 2 and 2. 6 Å resolution, at pH 5. 3 and 8. 7, respectively. Na+ ions occupy all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule.
T cells recognize foreign peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex ( pMHC ) molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells ( APCs ) to initiate adaptive cellular immunity. In vitro, high-affinity binding and/or long-lived interactions between T cell receptors ( TCRs ) and pMHC correlate with high-potency T cell activation. However, the influence of TCR/pMHC interaction parameters on T cell responses in vivo is less well understood. We studied the influence of TCR/pMHC binding characteristics on in vivo T cell immunity by tracking CD4+ T cell activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting a range of TCR/pMHC half-lives and in vitro T cell activation potencies. Contrary to predictions from in vitro studies, we found that optimal in vivo T cell responses occur to ligands with intermediate TCR/pMHC half-lives. The diminished in vivo responses we observed to the ligand exhibiting the longest TCR/pMHC half-life were associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function over a broad range of time points. Our results reveal a level of control over T cell activation in vivo not recapitulated in in vitro assays and highlight the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands as part of vaccine design.
Nectria haematococca, also known by its asexual name Fusarium solani, is a member of the Fusarium solani species complex, a group of over 50 phylogenetic species. This fungus is known to colonize a wide variety of environments and can cause disease in over 100 genera of plants as well as opportunistic infections in humans. The most extensively studied member of this complex is N. haematococca mating population VI ( MPVI ). The genome of N. haematococca MPVI isolate 77-13-4 consists of 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6. 52 Mb and has a physical size of 54. 43 Mb, which is larger than that of any other published ascomycete. The number of predicted genes, 15, 707, is also among the largest reported for ascomycetes. Two classes of genes have contributed to gene expansion in N. haematococca MPVI: genes that are not found in other fungi, including its closest sequenced relative Fusarium graminearum, and genes that occur as single copies in other fungi but are present as multiple copies in N. haematococca MPVI. The supernumerary nature of three chromosomes, 14, 15, and 17, was confirmed by their absence in pulsed field gel electrophoresis experiments of some isolates and by demonstrating that these isolates lacked chromosome-specific sequences found on the ends of these chromosomes. These supernumerary chromosomes contain more repeat sequences, are enriched in unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content in comparison to the other chromosomes.
Egress of newly assembled herpesvirus particles from infected cells is a highly dynamic process that involves the host secretory pathway working in concert with viral components. To elucidate the location, dynamics, and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress, we developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to visualize the final transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) particles in non-polarized epithelial cells. Our method is based on total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy to selectively image fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane, and takes advantage of a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the precise moment and location of particle exocytosis. We found that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is most frequently near patches of LL5β, part of a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. Vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exocytosis for several seconds, and membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane. After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. We propose an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress.
Enterobius vermicularis infection and its treatment with mebendazole have been associated with changes in the intestinal microbiota of primary school children. In this study, we examined the impact of pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment on intestinal microbial composition and mucosal immune responses in 109 primary school children. We found that pinworm infection was associated with increased intestinal bacterial diversity, which peaked after administration of mebendazole. At the phylum level, pinworm infection and mebendazole deworming were associated with a decreased relative abundance of Fusobacteria and an increased proportion of Actinobacteria. Furthermore, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment. The intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A ( SIgA ) level was found to be lower in the pinworm-infected group, and was elevated in half of the mebendazole-treated group. However, a higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole deworming treatment. These findings suggest that childhood exposure to pinworm plus mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria including the probiotic Bifidobacterium, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria.
Root length in Arabidopsis thaliana is a complex trait that does not follow the common view in quantitative genetics that most genetic variance for complex traits is expected to be additive. We found that the genomic narrow-sense heritability for root length in the examined population was statistically zero, and the low amount of additive genetic variance that could be captured by the genome-wide genotypes likely explains why no associations to root length could be found using standard additive-model-based genome-wide association ( GWA ) approaches. However, the broad-sense heritability for root length was significantly larger and primarily due to epistasis. Therefore, we also performed an epistatic GWA analysis to map loci contributing to the epistatic genetic variance. This analysis revealed four interacting pairs of loci involving seven chromosomal loci that passed a standard multiple-testing corrected significance threshold. The genotype-phenotype maps for these pairs revealed epistasis that cancelled out the additive genetic variance, explaining why these loci were not detected in the additive GWA analysis. We estimated the false-positive risk using a new statistical approach that suggested half of the associated pairs to be true positive associations. Our experimental evaluation of candidate genes within the seven associated loci suggests that this estimate is conservative; we identified functional candidate genes that affected root development in four loci that were part of three of the pairs.
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) mutations are a common cause of human disease. We analyzed 30, 506 mtDNA sequences from around the world and found that the background mtDNA haplogroup influences the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mtDNA mutations. We determined the pathogenicity score of the major alleles for each sequence and found that the mean pathogenicity score for known disease-causing mutations was significantly different between mtDNA macro-haplogroups. We also found that disease-causing mutations were more frequent on young sequences and that genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance. These findings implicate the mtDNA background in recurrent mutation events that have been purified through natural selection in older populations. This provides an explanation for the low frequency of mtDNA disease reported in specific ethnic groups. We found that the number of mtDNA sequences harboring two or more disease-causing mutations was 6-fold lower than expected by chance in macro-haplogroup N sequences. This suggests that the mtDNA sequence background influences the likelihood of acquiring or retaining a disease-causing mutation. We also found statistical evidence of haplogroup clustering for 10 ( 29. 4% ) of the 34 recurrent disease-causing mtDNA mutations.
Collective cell migration is an important biological process that plays a key role in cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing. In this process, cells are able to coordinate their motion, leading to collective motility. To study these cell-cell interactions, which include contact inhibition of locomotion ( CIL ), micropatterned substrates are often used to restrict cell migration to linear, quasi-one-dimensional paths. Using a computational phase field model of collective cell motility that includes the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for CIL, we are able to reproduce all cases seen in two-cell collisions. A subtle balance between the internal cell polarization, CIL and cell-cell adhesion governs the collision outcome. We identify the parameters that control transitions between the different cases, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These parameters suggest hypotheses for why different cell types have different collision behavior and the effect of interventions that modulate collision outcomes.
The dissociation mechanism of thioredoxin ( Trx ) mixed disulfide complexes has been a subject of debate for over twenty years. We investigated the dissociation mechanism of the Trx mixed disulfide complex with its endogenous substrate, arsenate reductase ( ArsC ), using a multidisciplinary approach including theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical complex formation experiments with Cys-mutants. Our results show that the conformational changes around the intermediate disulfide bring Cys32Trx in contact with Cys29Trx. Cys32Trx is activated for its nucleophilic attack by hydrogen bonds and is found to be more reactive than Cys82ArsC. Additionally, Cys32Trx directs its nucleophilic attack on the more susceptible Cys29Trx and not on Cys89ArsC. Our results provide fresh insights into a universal thiol/disulfide exchange reaction mechanism that results in reduced substrate and oxidized Trx. In this mechanism, Cys29Trx nucleophilically attacks Cys89ArsC of the Cys82ArsC-Cys89ArsC disulfide, leading to the formation of the Trx-ArsC mixed disulfide intermediate complex between Cys29Trx and Cys89ArsC. Cys32Trx then performs a nucleophilic attack on Cys29Trx of the Cys29Trx-Cys89ArsC disulfide, leading to the dissociation of the mixed disulfide and the release of reduced ArsC and oxidized Trx.
Inter-temporal preferences refer to the degree to which an outcome feature contributes to a person’s preference. We hypothesised that people can be uncertain about their preferences and that this uncertainty is reflected in their choice variability. This uncertainty can be updated by considering evidence, such as the preferences of others, and performing Bayesian updating. Temporal discounting coefficients, which quantify impulsivity, are an important example of taste–for patience and can change upon observing others’ choices. We examined discounting preferences in a large community study of 14–24 year olds. We found good evidence for taste uncertainty and for Bayesian taste updating. First, participants displayed decision variability which was better accounted for by a random-taste than by a response-noise model. Second, apparent taste shifts were well described by a Bayesian model taking into account taste uncertainty and the relevance of social information. Our findings have important neuroscientific, clinical and developmental significance.
Filamentous growth in budding yeast is a complex differentiation response that occurs under specific environmental conditions and is regulated by multiple pathways. To identify new aspects of filamentous growth regulation, we developed a novel screening approach called secretion profiling that measures the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2p, the signaling mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth ( FG ) MAPK pathway. Secretion profiling of complementary genomic collections showed that many of the pathways that regulate filamentous growth ( RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG ) are also required for FG pathway activation. This regulation sensitizes the FG pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizes it to the global signaling network. Several of the regulators are required for MSB2 expression, which identifies the MSB2 promoter as a target “hub” where multiple signals converge. The MSB2 promoter is further regulated by the histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) Rpd3p ( L ), which positively regulates FG pathway activity and filamentous growth. Our findings provide the first glimpse of a global regulatory hierarchy among the pathways that control filamentous growth and suggest that systems-level integration of signaling circuitry is likely to coordinate other regulatory networks that control complex behaviors.
Fruiting body development in filamentous fungi is an ideal system for studying the evolution of sexual phenotypes. In the Sordariomycetes, we have shown that few developmental genes whose expression evolves retain common phenotypes or even phenotypes corresponding to a common stage of development, yet numerous genes do retain some function within the larger fruiting body developmental process. We have identified key genes and their relevance to sexual development, and their lability in the network regulating fungal sexual reproduction using an efficient systematic approach empowered by comparison and contrast of gene expression programs across multiple taxa. We reconstructed ancestral gene expression phenotypes, identifying genes with the largest evolved increases in gene expression across development. Conducting knockouts and performing phenotypic analysis in two divergent species typically demonstrated altered fruiting body development in the species that had evolved increased expression. Our evolutionary approach to finding relevant genes proved far more efficient than other gene deletion studies targeting whole genomes or gene families. Combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes facilitated the refinement of Bayesian networks of the genes underlying fruiting body development, regulation of which is one of the least understood processes of multicellular development.
Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. The schistosome egg represents an attractive target for transgenesis because of the high ratio of germ to somatic cells, which allows for the propagation and amplification of transgenes. Here, we investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules into eggs of Schistosoma mansoni. We found that electroporation was more efficient than soaking alone for transduction of schistosome eggs by messenger RNA encoding luciferase and by pseudotyped retrovirus virions. Electroporation resulted in 2–3 times as many copies of provirus in miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs compared to soaking alone. We also found that electroporated Cy3-siRNA entered the eggs and entered the miracidium within the eggshell. Luciferase activity was detected in extracts of eggs three hours after electroporation of capped mRNA, but not after soaking alone. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.
The Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission ( PMT ) model is a novel approach developed to study the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies. This method involves probing the macromolecular assembly with an initial perturbation and monitoring the time-dependent responses of all residues simultaneously from the moment of perturbation until all residues reach the equilibrium state. The PMT model assumes that perturbations are transmitted by a Markovian process through the connected network defined by the contacts between atoms and residues. This approach enables the characterization of the temporal dynamic response to signal perturbation across all residues in a large macromolecular assembly at all time scales, from the beginning perturbation until the equilibrium state is reached. The PMT model can identify pivot residues important for macromolecular movement, messenger residues key to signal mediating, and anchor residues important for binding interactions. We applied the PMT model to the GroEL-GroES chaperone system and found that our predictions have an accuracy of 71–84% judged by independent experimental studies reported in the literature. This approach is general and can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries such as the virus capsid and ribosomal complex.
CGL2, a galectin from the fungus Coprinopsis cinerea, is toxic to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans fed with E. coli cells expressing CGL2 exhibited inhibited development, reproduction, and ultimately death. The nematotoxicity of CGL2 depends on the interaction between the galectin and a fucose-containing glycoconjugate. A screen for CGL2-resistant C. elegans mutants identified the glycoconjugate as a Galβ1, 4Fucα1, 6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores. This modification is required for CGL2-mediated nematotoxicity, as C. elegans mutants defective in GDP-fucose biosynthesis were resistant to CGL2. The X-ray crystal structure of a complex between CGL2 and the Galβ1, 4Fucα1, 6GlcNAc trisaccharide at 1. 5 Å resolution revealed the biophysical basis for this interaction. Our results suggest that fungal galectins play a role in the defense of fungi against predators by binding to specific glycoconjugates of these organisms. The identification of a novel putative glycosyltransferase required for the biosynthesis of the Galβ1, 4Fucα1, 6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores may shed light on the physiological significance of this N-glycan modification.
The existence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV. We present a within-host quasispecies model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir, which we then nest into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. For biologically plausible parameter values, we find that the presence of a latent reservoir can severely delay evolutionary dynamics within a single host, with longer delays associated with larger relative reservoir sizes and/or homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. These delays can fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale. In particular, the delay in within-host evolutionary dynamics can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate viral loads consistent with maximising transmission, as is observed, and not the very high viral loads that previous models have predicted. These results depend strongly on within-host characteristics such as the relative reservoir size, with the evolution of intermediate viral loads observed only when the within-host dynamics are sufficiently delayed. We argue that the latent reservoir has important, and hitherto under-appreciated, roles in both within- and between-host viral evolution.
Coxsackievirus B3 ( CVB3 ) profoundly inhibits the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway in vivo, thereby evading CD8+ T cell immunity. In contrast, the presentation of CVB3-encoded MHC class II epitopes is relatively unencumbered, and CVB3 induces in vivo CD4+ T cell responses that are phenotypically normal. CVB3-specific CD4+ T cells display an effector phenotype and a Th1 cytokine profile, and are enriched among CD4+ T cells in peripheral sites of virus infection that are major targets of CVB3 pathogenesis. Using epitope-specific transgenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as sensors of in vitro and in vivo antigen presentation, we show that CVB3 induces essentially no detectable in vivo primary CD8+ T cell response. In contrast, CVB3 induces both primary and memory CD4+ T cell responses. CVB3-specific CD4+ T cells expand dramatically following challenge infection and rapidly differentiate into secondary effector cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines. Our findings have implications for the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during coxsackievirus infection.
Leprosy Type 1 reactions ( T1Rs ) are a major cause of nerve damage and preventable disability in leprosy patients. Leprosy T1Rs are treated with oral corticosteroids, but the optimal dose and duration of treatment are not well established. Leprosy T1Rs are characterised by a Th1 immune profile, with cells in cutaneous and neural lesions expressing interferon-γ and interleukin-12. We investigated the efficacy of high dose intravenous methylprednisolone ( MP ) followed by oral prednisolone compared to oral prednisolone alone in patients with leprosy T1Rs and/or nerve function impairment ( NFI ). Forty-two patients were randomised to receive MP followed by oral prednisolone ( n = 20 ) or oral prednisolone alone ( n = 22 ). There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement at the completion of the study. However, patients treated with MP were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and day 113 of the study. The study also demonstrated that 50% of patients with leprosy T1Rs and/or NFI required additional prednisolone despite treatment with 16 weeks of corticosteroids. These findings support the use of more prolonged courses of corticosteroids to treat leprosy T1Rs and the investigation of risk factors for recurrence of leprosy T1Rs and NFI during and after corticosteroid treatment.
Regulatory CD4+CD25highFoxP3+ T cells ( Treg ) have been shown to modulate CD8+ T cell responses in HIV-negative settings, at least in part through the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. We investigated the effects of Treg from HIV-infected patients ( Treg/HIV+ ) on CD8+ T cell responses in chronic HIV infection. We found that Treg/HIV+ did not significantly inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8+ T cell function, suggesting either a defect in the suppressive capacity of Treg/HIV+ or a lack of sensitivity of effector T cells in HIV infection. However, Treg/HIV+ inhibited the IFN-γ expression of autologous CD8+ T cells stimulated with recall CMV/EBV/Flu ( CEF ) antigens, but did not inhibit HIV-Gag–specific CD8+ T cells. In contrast, Treg from HIV-negative controls ( Treg/HIV- ) inhibited the differentiation of both CEF- and Gag-specific CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients. The expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 was higher on Gag-specific CD8+ T cells than on CEF-specific CD8+ T cells, and did not change significantly after Treg depletion or co-culture with Treg/HIV-. Our results suggest that Treg/HIV+ have a defect in modulating both the differentiation and the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 T cells, which might contribute to the exhaustion of HIV-specific T cell responses.
Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-S-transferase ( WbGST ) has been evaluated as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. The WbGST gene was cloned from the third stage larval ( L3 ) cDNA libraries of W. bancrofti, and recombinant WbGST ( rWbGST ) was expressed and purified. Serum samples from individuals living in an endemic area were analyzed for their reactivity with rWbGST, showing that sera from endemic normal individuals ( EN ) carry significant levels of anti-WbGST IgG antibodies compared to subjects who are microfilaraemic ( Mf ) or show symptoms of clinical pathology ( CP ). Subsequent functional analysis of rWbGST showed that the rWbGST protein retained the enzymatic activity of GST and the antibodies in EN sera could inhibit this enzymatic activity. Similar results were obtained when anti-rWbGST antibodies raised in mice were used in the neutralization assay. Brugia malayi GST and WbGST show significant sequence similarity. Therefore, to evaluate the vaccine potential of rWbGST, we used B. malayi L3 as challenge parasites. Vaccine potential of rWbGST was initially evaluated by confirming the role of human and mice WbGST antibodies in an antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) assay. Subsequent vaccination studies in a jird model showed that approximately 61% protection could be achieved against a B. malayi L3 challenge infection in jirds immunized with rWbGST.
CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have revolutionized genome editing of experimental organisms and hold immense potential for therapeutic applications. However, despite significant advances in our understanding of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, concerns remain over the potential for off-target effects. Recent studies have used whole-genome sequencing of gene-edited embryos or animals to search for de novo mutations ( DNMs ), which may represent candidate changes introduced by poor editing fidelity. However, these studies used strain-matched, but not pedigree-matched controls, and thus were unable to reliably distinguish generational or colony-related differences from true DNMs. Here, we used a trio design and whole-genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, where 10 of the embryos were mutagenised with well-characterised gRNAs targeting the coat colour Tyrosinase ( Tyr ) locus. We found that if CRISPR mutagenesis were causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos, then the number of these mutations is not statistically distinguishable from the background rate of DNMs occurring due to other processes.
Stomatal pores on plant leaves regulate CO2 uptake for photosynthesis and water loss by transpiration. Blue light is one of the environmental signals that control stomatal aperture, and the signal transduction cascades that link light perception to stomatal opening are still largely unknown. Here, we report two new players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 ( HRB1 ) and Protein Phosphatase 7 ( PP7 ), and their genetic and biochemical interactions in the control of stomatal aperture. Mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both HRB1 and PP7 are expressed in guard cells in response to a light-to-dark or dark-to-light transition. HRB1 interacts with PP7 through its N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif and requires a functional PP7 for its stomatal opening response. HRB1 is phosphorylated in vivo, and PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1. We propose that a modification of HRB1 by PP7 under blue light is essential to acquire a proper conformation or to bring in new components for the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex. This study may furnish strategies that allow plants to enjoy the advantages of both constitutive and ABA-induced protection under water-limiting conditions.
The C. elegans Mediator subunit MDT-15 is a transcriptional coregulator that plays a critical role in integrating metabolic responses to ingested materials, including nutrients, xenobiotics, and heavy metals. MDT-15 is a component of the Mediator complex, which is targeted by many transcriptional regulatory factors. In this study, we demonstrate that MDT-15 is required for the induction of detoxification genes in response to certain xenobiotics and heavy metals, and that depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene renders C. elegans hypersensitive to toxin exposure. MDT-15 appears to selectively affect stress responses related to ingestion, as it does not abrogate other stress responses, such as thermotolerance. Our findings suggest that MDT-15 integrates several transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor both the availability and quality of ingested materials. We propose a model whereby MDT-15 coordinates systemic adaptation to ingestion-related stress, ensuring maintenance of health and longevity. MDT-15 integrates expression of metabolic genes by interacting with at least two metabolic regulatory factors, NHR-49 and SBP-1, and may similarly integrate the transcriptional response to environmental stressors such as xenobiotics and heavy metals by employing a different set of regulatory factors.
Hippocampal spatial map formation is central to an animal's ability to navigate its environment. We hypothesize that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information. Since co-firing implies spatial overlap of place fields, a map encoded by co-firing will be based on connectivity and adjacency, i. e., it will be a topological map. We test this topological hypothesis with a simple model of hippocampal activity, varying three parameters ( firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons ) in computer simulations of rat trajectories in three topologically and geometrically distinct test environments. Using a computational algorithm based on Persistent Homology theory, we find that the patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. Our simulations reveal a “learning region” that highlights the interplay between the parameters in combining to produce hippocampal states that are more or less adept at map formation. For example, within the learning region a lower number of neurons firing can be compensated by adjustments in firing rate or place field size, but beyond a certain point map formation begins to fail. We propose that this learning region provides a coherent theoretical lens through which to view conditions that impair spatial learning by altering place cell firing rates or spatial specificity.
Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) egress from infected cells involves the assembly of virions on lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) in association with components of very low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) synthesis, and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements for and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete. We combined RNA interference ( RNAi ) analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion with live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking to gain a detailed understanding of HCV egress. RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network ( TGN ), VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. Our results support a model wherein HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. We constructed infectious HCV with a tetracysteine ( TC ) tag insertion in core ( TC-core ) to monitor the dynamics of HCV core trafficking in association with its cellular cofactors. TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and this movement can be inhibited by nocodazole. Sub-populations of TC-core localize to the Golgi and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome. Silencing of the recycling endosome component Rab11a results in the accumulation of HCV core at the Golgi. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) and VAMP1 vesicles.
Loss of the imprinted gene Grb10 promotes tumor formation in irradiated Nf1+/- mice. Grb10 is an imprinted gene that is expressed from only one parental allele, and heterozygous loss of the expressed allele results in complete loss of protein expression. In a mouse model of radiotherapy-associated second malignant neoplasms that arise in irradiated NF1 patients, Grb10 expression was found to be widely absent in tumor cell lines. Analysis of cell lines and primary tumors demonstrated that the expressed allele of Grb10 was commonly lost in diverse Nf1 mutant tumors. We show that Grb10 loss can occur during in vivo tumorigenesis, with a functional consequence in untransformed primary cells. In tumors, Grb10 loss independently promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which promotes hyperproliferation, an early feature of tumor development. In the context of a robust Nf1 mutant mouse model of cancer, this work identifies a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumorigenesis. We show that Grb10 is a negative regulator of Ras signaling, and contributes significantly to Ras dysregulation in the setting of Nf1-mediated tumorigenesis. These findings demonstrate a previously undescribed role for an imprinted gene in disease and suggest that mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin.
Learning to predict threat from environmental cues is a fundamental skill in changing environments. Pavlovian threat conditioning is a laboratory example of this process, in which the contingent presentation of predictive cues ( conditioned stimuli, CS ) and aversive events ( unconditioned stimuli, US ) engages a process of associative learning. However, our understanding of this process is fragmented, and different computational models give rise to different and partly opposing predictions for the trial-by-trial dynamics of learning. Here, we investigate human autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlovian fear conditioning. We build on a statistical framework for psychophysiological modelling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses. We then consider previously proposed non-probabilistic models, a simple probabilistic model, and non-learning models, as well as different observation functions to link learning models with ANS activity. Across three experiments, and both for skin conductance ( SCR ) and pupil size responses ( PSR ), a probabilistic learning model best explains ANS responses. Notably, SCR and PSR reflect different quantities of the same model: SCR track a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, while PSR track expected outcome alone. This suggests that the formation and maintenance of Pavlovian threat predictions in humans may rely on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty.
In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the septation initiation network ( SIN ) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathway play essential roles in cytokinesis, septation, and conidiation. The SIN is composed of a conserved SepH ( Cdc7p ) kinase cascade, while the MAPK pathway depends on successive signaling cascade phosphorylation to sense and respond to stress and environmental factors. In this study, we identified a SepH suppressor, PomA, as a negative regulator of septation and conidiation. The pomA mutant is able to cure defects of sepH1 in septation and conidiation, and overexpression of pomA remarkably suppresses septation. Under normal cultural conditions, SepH positively regulates the phosphorylation of MAPK-HogA, while PomA reversely affects this process. In the absence of PbsB, a putative upstream member of HogA, PomA and SepH are unable to affect the phosphorylation level of HogA. Under osmotic stress conditions, the induced phosphorylated HogA is capable of bypassing the requirement of SepH, but not the whole SIN requirement.
Leishmania RNA virus 1 ( LRV1 ) has been associated with the severity of mucosal leishmaniasis ( ML ) in experimental animal models. However, the relationship between LRV1 and the clinical manifestations of tegumentary leishmaniasis ( TL ) in humans is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the presence of LRV1 in patients with TL and its association with the clinical manifestations of the disease. A total of 156 patients with TL were included in the study, of whom 109 had cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ), 38 had mucosal leishmaniasis ( ML ), 5 had concomitant CL and ML, 3 had disseminated leishmaniasis ( DL ), and 1 had diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis ( DCL ). LRV1 was detected in 71. 1% of patients with ML and 36. 7% of patients with CL. The presence of LRV1 was significantly associated with the occurrence of ML ( odds ratio = 2. 93; 95% CI 1. 57–5. 46; p < 0. 001 ). LRV1 was detected in patients infected with Leishmania ( Viannia ) braziliensis, Leishmania ( V. ) guyanensis, Leishmania ( V. ) lainsoni, Leishmania ( Leishmania ) amazonensis, and Leishmania sp. LRV1 is not the only factor contributing to the clinical manifestations of TL, and other factors such as the species of Leishmania and the immune status of the host may also play a role.
Type I interferon ( IFN-I ) plays an important role in the host defense against Streptococcus pneumoniae infection by counteracting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to the blood. Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor ( Ifnar1−/− ) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against the type I interferon receptor exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection, while maintaining comparable bacterial numbers in the lung. In contrast, treatment of mice with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double stranded RNA ( poly ( I:C ) ) dramatically reduced the development of bacteremia following intranasal infection with S. pneumoniae. IFNβ treatment led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of the pneumococcal uptake receptor, platelet activating factor receptor ( PAF receptor ). As a result, IFN-I reduced pneumococcal cell invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers, and Ifnar1−/− mice showed overall enhanced lung permeability. Our data identify IFN-I as an important component of the host immune defense that regulates two possible mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion, i. e. PAF receptor-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration, ultimately limiting progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease.
In this study, we demonstrate that a multi-layer network of spiking neurons is capable of learning a complex foraging task involving pattern discrimination and decision making. The network consists of three layers: an input layer ( I ), a hidden layer ( H ), and an output layer ( O ). The hidden layer employs non-reward modulated spike time dependent plasticity ( STDP ), while the output layer employs reward modulated STDP. We show that the addition of a hidden layer with non-reward modulated STDP creates neurons that respond to specific combinations of inputs, allowing for basic classification of input patterns. When combined with a following layer of neurons implementing rewarded STDP, the network is able to learn discrimination between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled training data. Synaptic noise allows for trial-and-error learning, enabling the network to identify goal-oriented strategies that are effective in solving the task. The study predicts that a set of properties of the spiking neuronal network with STDP is sufficient to solve a complex foraging task involving pattern classification and decision making.
The transcription factor ELF5 has been identified as a key driver of metastasis in luminal breast cancer. In the mouse mammary tumor virus-Polyoma Middle T ( MMTV-PyMT ) model of luminal breast cancer, induction of ELF5 increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors, and greatly increased the size and number of lung metastases. ELF5 was found to recruit myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSCs ) to the tumor, a group of immature neutrophils implicated in vasculogenesis and metastasis. Depletion of MDSCs using specific antibodies prevented ELF5 from driving vasculogenesis and metastasis. Expression signatures in luminal A breast cancers indicated that increased MDSC invasion and inflammation were correlated with ELF5 expression, and increased ELF5 immunohistochemical staining predicted much shorter metastasis–free and overall survival of luminal A patients. Thus, in the MMTV-PyMT mouse mammary model, increased ELF5 levels drive metastasis by co-opting the innate immune system. This finding implicates ELF5 as a defining factor in the acquisition of the key aspects of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer.
The interaction between chromatin loops plays an important role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. These loops can be characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form. In this study, we develop a stochastic model that maps these factors into a 4–state model of stochastic transcription. We first show that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce expression noise, whereas alternating loops have the opposite effects. We then compare the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression and find that the former performs better than the latter in controlling mean expression and in tuning expression noise. However, this control or tuning is distance–dependent, remarkable for moderate loop lengths, and there is a limit loop length such that the difference in effect between the two communication forms almost disappears. Our analysis and results justify the facilitated chromatin–looping hypothesis.
Metabolic engineering increasingly relies on RNA technology to customly rewire the metabolism to maximize production. However, the development of pure riboregulators, which repress gene expression without the need for a coexpressed protein, is limited by the lack of clear design principles. Here, we present a framework for the de novo design of translation inhibiting RNAs ( tiRNAs ), which repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. To develop this framework, we analyzed the influence of all features previously attributed to post-transcriptional gene modulation in a design of experiments ( DOE ). We identified 12 structural and thermodynamic features, of which six were retained after removing correlations from an in silico generated riboregulator library. From this library, 18 riboregulators were selected, constructed, and co-expressed with two target untranslated regions to link the translation inhibiting RNA features to functionality. The pure riboregulators showed repression down to 6% of the original protein expression levels, which could only be partially explained by an ordinary least squares regression model. A partial least squares regression model was constructed and validated to link the properties of translation inhibiting RNA riboregulators to gene repression. This approach enables a more reliable de novo forward engineering of effective pure riboregulators, which further expands the RNA toolbox for gene expression modulation.
Transient associations among neurons are thought to underlie memory and behavior. However, little is known about how such associations occur or how they can be identified. Here we show that when the composite activity of a local neuronal group exceeds a threshold, its activity pattern, as reflected in the local field potential ( LFP ), occurs without distortion at other cortex sites via fast synaptic transmission. These large-amplitude LFPs, which we call coherence potentials, extend up to hundreds of milliseconds and mark periods of loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information much like action potentials at the single-cell level. Coherence potentials have an additional degree of freedom in the diversity of their waveforms, which provides a high-dimensional parameter for encoding information and allows identification of particular associations. Such nonlinear behavior is analogous to the spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.
Nuclear size correlates with cell size, but the mechanism by which this scaling is achieved is not known. Here, we report the results of a systematic genetic screen of fission yeast gene deletion mutants to identify essential factors involved in nuclear size control. Our screen has identified 25 essential factors that alter nuclear size, and our analysis has implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in nuclear size control. This study has revealed lower and more extreme higher nuclear size phenotypes and has identified global cellular processes and specific structural nuclear components important for nuclear size control. In fission yeast, nuclear volume increases steadily with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant nuclear volume to cell volume ( N/C ) ratio throughout interphase. A screen of non-essential S. pombe gene deletion mutants implicated both bulk nucleocytoplasmic transport and regulation of lipid biosynthesis in nuclear size control. This suggests that both the regulation of global cellular processes, balancing levels of nucleoplasmic transcription and cytoplasmic translation, and regulation of the levels of specific structural components of the nucleus are important for nuclear size control. In multicellular organisms, the nucleocytoplasmic ratio varies between cell types, but is generally restricted to a narrow range for cells of each type. Nuclear volume correlates with cell volume across a wide range of cell sizes in both budding and fission yeasts.
Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) is an effective treatment for a variety of neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor ( ET ). The success of closed-loop DBS depends on devising a stimulation strategy that minimizes oscillations in neural activity associated with symptoms of motor disorders. Our work focuses on the use of coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas generating pathological oscillations. We use a reduced form of the Kuramoto model to analyse how a patient should respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude, provided a number of conditions are satisfied. We predict that the best stimulation strategy should be phase specific but also that stimulation should have a greater effect if applied when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. We compare this prediction with data obtained from ET patients and propose a new hybrid strategy which effectively combines two of the closed-loop strategies found in the literature, namely phase-locked and adaptive DBS. Our predictions have been shown to generalize to other models and have been observed in a biologically realistic model of a neural circuit generating oscillations related to Parkinson’s disease.
Schistosomiasis is one of the most common endemic parasitic diseases, affecting over 230 million people worldwide. Schistosoma mansoni is the main causative agent of intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis. Biomphalaria glabrata snails are the intermediate hosts of S. mansoni. To control schistosomiasis, it is essential to develop new molecular monitoring assays for large-scale screening of snails from transmission sites to detect the presence of schistosomes. We developed and evaluated a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP ) assay combined with a simple DNA extraction method to detect S. mansoni in experimentally infected Biomphalaria glabrata snails. The LAMP assay targets a sequence of S. mansoni ribosomal intergenic spacer 28S-18S rRNA and has a detection limit of 0. 1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. The assay was evaluated by examining S. mansoni DNA in snails exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure. We detected S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails by using a commercial DNA extraction kit or a simple heat NaOH extraction method. Our LAMP assay, named Biompha-LAMP, is specific, sensitive, rapid, and potentially adaptable as a cost-effective method for screening of intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples. This assay could be suitable for large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas.
Dengue has been reported as a public health problem in Sri Lanka since the 1960s. The Ministry of Health is responsible for controlling dengue and other disease outbreaks. We estimated the public sector costs of dengue control activities and the direct costs of hospitalizations in Colombo, the most heavily urbanized district in Sri Lanka, during the epidemic year of 2012. The total cost of dengue control and reported hospitalizations was estimated at US$3. 45 million ( US$1. 50 per capita ) in Colombo district in 2012. Personnel costs accounted for the largest shares of the total costs of dengue control activities ( 79% ) and hospitalizations ( 46% ). The results indicated a per capita cost of US$0. 42 for dengue control activities. The average costs per hospitalization ranged between US$216–609 for pediatric cases and between US$196–866 for adult cases according to disease severity and treatment setting. This analysis is a first attempt to assess the economic burden of dengue response in the public health sector in Sri Lanka.
European Y-chromosomal lineages, which are passed down from father to son, have been the subject of intense debate regarding their origins. Previous studies suggested that haplogroup R1b1b2 ( R-M269 ), the most common European Y-chromosomal lineage, originated from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers. However, we show that the geographical distribution of its microsatellite diversity is best explained by its spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic period. This suggests that most European Y chromosomes originate in the Neolithic expansion. The expansion of haplogroups R1b1b2, E1b1b1 ( E-M35 ), and J from the Near East during the Neolithic period makes Europe a prime example of how technological and cultural change is linked with the expansion of a Y-chromosomal lineage. This pattern contrasts with that shown by maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, which suggests a unique role for males in the transition.
Motor learning is a complex process that can be influenced by a variety of factors, including movement variability. It has been suggested that movement variability can increase the speed of motor learning. However, we use computational modeling of motor adaptation to show that variability can have both positive and negative effects on learning. Our model simulations reveal that increased variability does not typically enable faster learning and sometimes even slows it down. In fact, it makes no computational sense for movement variability to generally increase learning speed. We performed computer simulations of error-based learning with a widely accepted optimal learner model and found that the relation between variability and learning rate varies widely in motor adaptation, possibly depending on which computational factor dominates the performance in a specific task. We also performed a meta-analysis of published papers and found that across a wide range of experiments, movement variability has no statistical relation with learning rate. We hypothesize that motor variability is correlated to learning rate in a task-specific way, depending on which factor predominantly affects task performance. Our results suggest that further research is needed to understand the relative importance of the factors involved in motor learning.
RelA, the most potent and ubiquitously expressed member of the NF-κB family, plays a crucial role in cellular immune and inflammatory responses, survival, and proliferation by regulating the transcription of various genes involved in these processes. RelA interacts with transcriptional co-activators such as CREB-binding protein ( CBP ) and its paralog p300 in addition to its cognate κB sites on the promoter/enhancer regions of DNA. The RelA:CBP/p300 complex is comprised of two components: the DNA binding domain of RelA interacts with the KIX domain of CBP/p300, and the transcriptional activation domain ( TAD ) of RelA binds to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300. A phosphorylation event of a well-conserved RelA ( Ser276 ) is prerequisite for the former interaction to occur. Here, we provide the solution structure of the latter component of the RelA:CBP complex by NMR spectroscopy. The structure reveals the folding of RelA–TA2 upon binding to TAZ1 through its well-conserved hydrophobic sites in a series of grooves on the TAZ1 surface. We further show how the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through the negative feedback loop of the NF-κB pathway.
Gene set analysis is a statistical method used to analyze gene expression data by considering predefined groups of genes. However, this method has been mainly applied to cross-sectional studies. Here, we introduce time-course gene set analysis ( TcGSA ), an extension of gene set analysis to longitudinal data. TcGSA is based on random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates and can handle unbalanced data due to missing at random ( MAR ) measurements. It is a hypothesis-driven method that identifies a priori defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account the potential heterogeneity of expression within gene sets. When comparing biological conditions, TcGSA indicates if the time patterns of gene sets significantly differ according to these conditions. We applied TcGSA to two real-life datasets: an HIV therapeutic vaccine trial ( DALIA-1 trial ) and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. TcGSA revealed a significant change in gene expression over time within 69 gene sets during vaccination in the DALIA-1 trial, while a standard univariate individual gene analysis and a standard Gene Set Enrichment Analysis ( GSEA ) for time series failed to detect any significant pattern change over time. In the second dataset, TcGSA allowed the identification of 4 gene sets linked with the influenza vaccine, although they were found to be associated with the pneumococcal vaccine only in previous analyses.
Plasmodium vivax is the second most prevalent malaria parasite after Plasmodium falciparum. However, the spatial epidemiology and geographical distribution of P. vivax are far less well understood than that of P. falciparum. Here, we present the first systematic effort to map the global endemicity of P. vivax. We updated our earlier estimate of the geographical limits of P. vivax transmission to 2010 and used a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach to estimate endemicity within every 5×5 km resolution grid square. The model incorporated data on Duffy negative phenotype frequency to suppress endemicity predictions, particularly in Africa. We used 9, 970 geopositioned P. vivax parasite rate ( PvPR ) surveys collected from 1985 to 2010. Endemicity was predicted within a relatively narrow range throughout the endemic world, with the point estimate rarely exceeding 7% PvPR1–99. The Americas contributed 22% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission, but high endemic areas were generally sparsely populated and the region contributed only 6% of the 2. 5 billion people at risk ( PAR ) globally. In Africa, Duffy negativity meant stable transmission was constrained to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3. 5% of global PAR. Central Asia was home to 82% of global PAR with important high endemic areas coinciding with dense populations particularly in India and Myanmar.
Clumping factor B ( ClfB ) is a cell wall-anchored protein expressed by Staphylococcus aureus that has been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of skin and soft tissue infections ( SSTIs ). Previous studies have demonstrated that ClfB facilitates S. aureus nasal colonization by binding to host ligands such as loricrin and cytokeratin 10 in the anterior nares. However, the role of ClfB in SSTIs has not been investigated until now. This study reveals that ClfB is crucial in determining the structure and bacterial burden of skin abscesses early in infection, and that this is dependent on a specific interaction with loricrin expressed within the abscess tissue. ClfB exerts its effect in the early stage of infection and its interaction with loricrin appears to play a role during pathogenesis. Targeting ClfB using a model vaccine that induced both protective humoral and cellular responses leads to protection during S. aureus skin infection. This study therefore identifies ClfB as an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines.
To achieve the 90-90-90 goals set by UNAIDS, the number of new HIV infections needs to decrease to approximately 500, 000 by 2020. One of the ‘five pillars’ to achieve this goal is pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ). Currently, Truvada ( emtricitabine-tenofovir ) is the only medication approved for PrEP, but it is costly and requires individuals to adhere to a once-daily regimen. To improve PrEP, next-generation regimens, including long-acting formulations, are being investigated. However, pre-clinical testing often fails to translate into clinical efficacy, and quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic and requires long and large trials. To prioritize and help design PrEP regimens, tools are urgently needed that integrate pharmacological, viral, and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. We developed an efficient and exact stochastic simulation approach to predict prophylactic efficacy, as an example for dolutegravir ( DTG ). Combining population pharmacokinetics of DTG with the stochastic framework, we predicted that plasma concentrations of 145. 18 and 722. 23nM prevent 50% and 90% sexual transmissions, respectively. We then predicted the reduction in HIV infection when DTG was used in PrEP, PrEP ‘on demand’, and post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) before/after virus exposure. Our simulations indicated that oral 50mg DTG is non-inferior to Truvada, and the predicted 90% preventive concentrations can guide release kinetics of currently developed DTG nano-formulations.
Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) is known to induce autophagy to enhance its replication. However, how HCV regulates the autophagic pathway remains largely unclear. In this report, we demonstrated that HCV infection induces the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. The induction of Rubicon by HCV is prompt, whereas the induction of UVRAG is delayed, resulting in the accumulation of autophagosomes in the early time points of viral infection. The role of Rubicon in inhibiting the maturation of autophagosomes in HCV-infected cells was confirmed by siRNA knockdown and the over-expression of Rubicon, which enhanced and suppressed the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. Rubicon plays a positive role in HCV replication, as the suppression of its expression reduces HCV replication and its over-expression enhances HCV replication. In contrast, the over-expression of UVRAG facilitates the maturation of autophagosomes and suppresses HCV replication. Our results indicate that HCV, by differentially inducing the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG, temporally regulates the autophagic flux to enhance its replication.
Cyclin Y-like 1 ( Ccnyl1 ) is a newly identified member of the cyclin family that is highly similar in protein sequence to Cyclin Y ( Ccny ). We found that Ccnyl1 is most abundantly expressed in the testis of mice and is about seven times higher than the level of Ccny. Male Ccnyl1-/- mice are infertile, whereas both male and female Ccny-/- mice display normal fertility. These results suggest that Ccnyl1, but not Ccny, is indispensable for male fertility. Spermatozoa obtained from Ccnyl1-/- mice display significantly impaired motility and represent a thinned annulus region and/or a bent head. We found that the protein, but not the mRNA, level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 ( CDK16 ) is decreased in the testis of Ccnyl1-/- mice. Further study demonstrated that Ccnyl1 interacts with CDK16 and this interaction mutually increases the stability of these two proteins. Moreover, the interaction increases the kinase activity of CDK16. We identified the phosphorylation sites of CDK16 by mass spectrometry and revealed that several phosphorylation modifications on the N-terminal region of CDK16 are indispensable for the Ccnyl1 binding and the modulation of CDK16 kinase activity. Our results therefore reveal a previously unrecognized role of Ccnyl1 in regulating spermatogenesis through the interaction and modulation of CDK16.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ) hemolysin ( EHEC-Hly ) is a virulence factor that causes diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome by damaging microvascular endothelial cells. EHEC-Hly exists in two forms: free and associated with outer membrane vesicles ( OMVs ) released by EHEC during growth. We investigated the biological effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, which are the major targets during EHEC infection. We demonstrate that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly does not lyse these cells, but instead triggers their apoptosis. The toxin is internalized by the cells via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs and trafficked with OMVs into endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification, EHEC-Hly escapes from the lysosomes via its pore-forming activity and targets mitochondria. This results in a decrease of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, translocation of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and subsequent activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, leading to apoptotic cell death. The ability of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly to trigger the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells indicates a novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases.
Transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) is accompanied by conserved patterns of histone modification. Histone H2B mono-ubiquitylation ( H2Bub1 ) plays a key role in coordinating co-transcriptional histone modification by promoting site-specific methylation of histone H3. H2Bub1 also regulates gene expression through an unidentified, methylation-independent mechanism. Here, we reveal bidirectional communication between H2Bub1 and Cdk9, the ortholog of metazoan positive transcription elongation factor b ( P-TEFb ), in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that lowering Cdk9 activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate, the transcription processivity factor Spt5, reduces H2Bub1 in vivo. Conversely, mutations in the H2Bub1 pathway impair Cdk9 recruitment to chromatin and decrease Spt5 phosphorylation. Moreover, an Spt5 phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of the histone H3 Lys4 methyltransferase Set1 phenocopies morphologic and growth defects due to H2Bub1 loss, suggesting independent, partially redundant roles for Cdk9 and Set1 downstream of H2Bub1. Genome-wide analyses by chromatin immunoprecipitation also demonstrate opposing effects of Cdk9 and H2Bub1 on distribution of transcribing RNAPII.
Yellow fever virus ( YFV ) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America and Africa. We reconstructed the evolutionary history of YFV by analyzing the prM/E gene region from 133 viral isolates sampled from 22 countries over 76 years. Our phylogenetic analysis revealed that the currently circulating strains of YFV arose in Africa within the last 1, 500 years and emerged in the Americas following the slave trade approximately 300–400 years ago. These viruses then spread westwards across the continent and persist to this day in the jungles of South America. Our results illustrate how gene sequence data can be used to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and document the role of human migration in the spread of infectious disease. We found no major difference in evolutionary dynamics among viruses circulating in South America or Africa, and neither population exhibited the increases in virus diversity expected of epidemic expansion. The virus established a sylvatic enzootic cycle within the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins vectored by Haemagogus and Sabethes mosquitoes following devastating urban outbreaks in port cities on both the east and west coasts of South America.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, was studied in an infant mouse model of colonization, disease, and transmission, both with and without influenza A ( IAV ) co-infection. The model was used to identify vulnerable points in pneumococcal pathogenesis by analyzing population bottlenecks. Our findings reveal that in the setting of IAV co-infection, the organism must pass through single cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. Passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. These observations demonstrate how viral infection, and TLR-dependent innate immune responses it stimulates, drive bacterial contagion.
Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis, is transmitted by the sand fly Phlebotomus orientalis in Eastern Africa. To evaluate exposure to P. orientalis bites in human populations from disease endemic areas, we tested the antibody reactions of volunteers' sera against recombinant P. orientalis salivary antigens. Recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on P. orientalis secreted salivary proteins were produced using either bacterial or mammalian expression systems and tested as antigens for detection of anti-P. orientalis IgG in human sera. Using these recombinant proteins, human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia were screened by ELISA and immunoblotting to identify the potential markers of exposure to P. orientalis bites. Two recombinant proteins, mYEL1 and mAG5, were identified as the most promising antigens showing high correlation coefficients as well as good specificity in comparison to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. The combination of both proteins led to a further increase of correlation coefficients as well as both positive and negative predictive values of P. orientalis exposure. This is the first report of screening human sera for anti-P. orientalis antibodies using recombinant salivary proteins. The recombinant salivary proteins mYEL1 and mAG5 proved to be valid antigens for screening human sera from both Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to P. orientalis bites.
IncC conjugative plasmids and Salmonella genomic island 1 ( SGI1 ) are frequently associated with multidrug resistance in clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. SGI1 is mobilized in trans by IncA and IncC plasmids following its excision from the chromosome, an event triggered by the transcriptional activator complex AcaCD encoded by these helper plasmids. Although SGI1 is not self-transmissible, it carries three genes, traNS, traHS and traGS, coding for distant homologs of the predicted mating pore subunits TraNC, TraHC and TraGC, respectively, encoded by A/C plasmids. We investigated the regulation of traNS and traHGS and the role of these three genes in the transmissibility of SGI1. We found that expression of traNS and traHGS is inducible by AcaCD and that TraNS, TraHS and TraGS are functional proteins. Complementation assays showed that not only do TraNS/HS/GS replace TraNC/HC/GC in the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids but also that traGS and traHS are both required for SGI1 optimal transfer. Furthermore, remodeling of the IncC-encoded mating pore by SGI1 was found to be essential to enhance transfer rate of SGI1 over the helper plasmid.
The polo-like kinase Cdc5 promotes adaptation to the DNA damage checkpoint in Saccharomyces cerevisiae by inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53. We show that Cdc5 is dose-dependent for adaptation and that its overexpression promotes faster adaptation, indicating that high levels of Cdc5 modulate the ability of the checkpoint to inhibit the downstream cell-cycle machinery. To pinpoint the step in the checkpoint pathway at which Cdc5 acts, we overexpressed CDC5 from the GAL1 promoter in damaged cells and examined key steps in checkpoint activation individually. We found that Cdc5 overproduction appeared to have little effect on the early steps leading to Rad53 activation, including checkpoint sensor localization, Mec1-phosphorylation of Rad9, and formation of the Rad9-Rad53 complex. However, damage-induced hyperphosphorylation of Rad53 was significantly reduced, consistent with the observation that cell-cycle arrest is lost during adaptation. Thus, we conclude that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation to allow cells to adapt to DNA damage. This mechanism is likely conserved in S. cerevisiae given that the Rad53 FHA domains and Mec1 phosphorylation sites are similarly required for its hyperphosphorylation.
Electrodiffusive effects in the extracellular space ( ECS ) of the brain play a crucial role in many pathological conditions, such as seizures, stroke, and spreading depression. To understand these pathologies, it is necessary to estimate the transport of ions due to electrodiffusive effects. However, this is currently unfeasible experimentally, but can be achieved with computational models based on biophysical principles and constraints. Previous computational models have been limited to small spatiotemporal scales ( micrometers and milliseconds ) or simplified and idealized 1-dimensional ( 1-D ) transport processes on a larger scale. Here, we present the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck ( KNP ) framework to explore electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. By assuming electroneutrality, the KNP-framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes on the spatiotemporal scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, making it feasible to run simulations on the spatiotemporal scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard desktop computer. We use the 3-D KNP framework to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and the electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. The simulation demonstrates the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework and elucidates the single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS. We envision that future applications of the framework to more complex and biologically realistic systems will be useful in exploring pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS.
The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) has proposed a budget cut of $26. 7 million from the vector-borne diseases program, which could jeopardize surveillance and research activities for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus. In order to demonstrate the consequences of such a measure, we evaluated the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in an economically developed urban environment. We used a mathematical model to generate hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia, and coupled the results with mosquito surveillance and case management costs to estimate the cumulative costs of each response scenario. Our study shows that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude in comparison to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the ones needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens, even without consideration of the cost in human lives and well-being. Our findings provide a science-based justification for the re-assessment of the current proposal to slash the budget of the CDC vector-borne diseases program, and emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance.
Dengue is an important cause of acute febrile illness in children and adults in western Nicaragua. In a prospective study of 740 consecutive patients aged ≥ 1 year presenting with acute febrile illness, we found that 63. 5% were seropositive for dengue at enrollment. The seroprevalence of dengue increased with age and reached >90% in people over the age of 20 years. We identified acute dengue ( serotypes 1 and 2 ) in 38 ( 5. 1% ) patients. Only 8. 1% ( 3/37 ) of confirmed cases were suspected clinically. Dengue was the etiologic agent responsible for 5. 1% ( 38/740 ) of acute febrile illnesses. In addition to confirmatory testing by assaying paired sera for IgM and IgG, 24. 3% were confirmed by PCR. Overall, 470 ( 63. 5% ) of patients were seropositive for dengue IgG at enrollment. The seroprevalence was 22% in those <5 years, 57% in those 5–9 years, 77% in those 10–14 years, 86% in those 15–19 years, 91% in those 20–24 years, 95% in those 25–29 years, and ~100% in those ≥ 30 years. Patients with and without acute dengue presented early ( median 4 [IQR 2–7] vs. 3 days [IQR 1–5], p = 0. 07 ). Those with acute dengue had clinical features similar to those with other acute febrile illnesses.
Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor–like kinase NILR1 is required for the induction of innate immunity to parasitic nematodes. Nematodes are destructive pests that cause billions of dollars in losses annually, and an effective plant defence against them relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) by surface-localised receptors leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity ( PTI ). Here we show that nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitors are capable of inducing PTI in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. We identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, termed NILR1, that is specifically regulated upon infection by nematodes and is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes. NILR1 is the first example of an immune receptor that is involved in the induction of basal immunity ( PTI ) in plants in response to nematodes. Manipulation of NILR1 will provide new options for nematode control in crop plants in the future.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug, has been shown to have anti-schistosomal properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of miltefosine on the surface antigens of S. mansoni adult worms in vitro. We found that miltefosine treatment increased the exposure of worm surface antigens, which were recognized by rabbit antibodies in an indirect immunofluorescence assay. These antibodies were recovered from the worm surface and used to identify the antigens in a western immunoblotting assay. Four proteins were identified as the S. mansoni proteins: fructose-1, 6 bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22. 6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These antibodies were also found to bind to the surface of 3-hour schistosomula and induce immune agglutination of the parasites. This study reveals a novel mode of action of miltefosine as an anti-schistosome agent, where the drug unmasks parasite surface antigens not normally exposed to the host during infection. These antigens could have potential as intervention targets and antibodies against these antigens may act to increase the drug’s anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in the development of resistance to re-infection.
Iron acquisition is a critical aspect of host-pathogen interactions that can have major consequences on the outcome of the disease. To overcome the low solubility and bioavailability of iron, bacteria have evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources such as heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. In the human opportunistic pathogen Bacillus cereus, a surface protein named IlsA binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. Here, we demonstrate that IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. Isothermal titration calorimetry data indicate that IlsA binds several types of ferritins through direct interaction with the shell subunits. UV-vis kinetic data show a significant enhancement of iron release from ferritin in the presence of IlsA. Disruption of the siderophore bacillibactin production drastically reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth and results in attenuated bacterial virulence in insects. We propose a new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus that involves the binding of IlsA to host ferritin followed by siderophore assisted iron uptake. Our results highlight a possible interplay between a surface protein and a siderophore and provide new insights into host adaptation of B. cereus and general bacterial pathogenesis.
The post-translational Kai circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus is a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer, with each monomer consisting of two domains, CI and CII, which can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only the CII domain can be phosphorylated. We present a new, thermodynamically consistent, statistical-mechanical model of the clock. The model is based on two main ideas: i ) ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active conformational state in which its phosphorylation level tends to rise and an inactive one in which it tends to fall; ii ) phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also explains how KaiA, by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor, can stimulate phosphorylation of KaiC, and how the differential affinity of KaiA for the different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. The model shows that the release of ADP from CI slows down as the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises, making the inactive conformational state of KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which not only stabilizes this state further, but also leads to the sequestration of KaiA, and hence to KaiC dephosphorylation.
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) suppresses innate immune signaling to establish persistent infection. Although HBV is a DNA virus, its pre-genomic RNA ( pgRNA ) can be sensed by RIG-I and activates MAVS to mediate interferon ( IFN ) λ synthesis. However, the underlying mechanism explaining how HBV infection fails to induce interferon-αβ ( IFN ) synthesis remained uncharacterized. We demonstrate that HBV induces parkin to recruit the linear ubiquitin assembly complex ( LUBAC ) to mitochondria and abrogates IFN β synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, accumulates unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS via LUBAC, to disrupt MAVS signalosome and attenuate IRF3 activation. This study highlights the novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling which involves LUBAC being recruited to the mitochondria. Parkin silencing restores IFN β synthesis in HBV expressing cells upon stimulation with RIG-I agonist pI:C. These findings establish the novel role of parkin in influencing MAVS signaling during HBV infection and provide molecular mechanisms of HBV-induced suppression of innate immunity.
Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease, is associated with immune responses to enteric bacteria. Here, we report the crystal structure of pfiT, a T cell superantigen encoded by the pfiT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, at 1. 7Å resolution. We also provide a functional analysis of the interaction of pfiT and its homolog, PA2885, with human class II MHC. Both pfiT and PA2885 bound to mammalian cells and stimulated the proliferation of human lymphocytes. This binding was greatly inhibited by anti-class II MHC HLA-DR antibodies, and to a lesser extent by anti-HLA-DQ and DP antibodies, indicating that the binding was class II MHC-specific. Structural analyses established that pfiT belongs to the TetR-family of DNA-binding transcription regulators. The distinct structure of pfiT indicates that it represents a new family of T cell superantigens. Our results indicate that pfiT and PA2885 specifically bind to class II MHC, and primarily to HLA-DR. We also show that pfiT and the superantigen Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen ( MAM ) compete for binding to HLA-DR, indicating that their binding sites overlap.
Nanog is a key regulator of pluripotency in embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and exhibits a disperse distribution within stem cell populations in vivo and in vitro. Recent evidence suggests that Nanog heterogeneity plays a functional role in stem cell fate decisions. In this study, we investigated how allelic control of Nanog expression influences the observed heterogeneity of Nanog in stem cell populations. We developed a multiscale stochastic population balance equation framework that considered allelic control, gene expression noise, and random partitioning at cell division. As a result of allelic Nanog expression, the distribution of Nanog exhibited three distinct states. However, when combined with transcriptional noise, the profile became bimodal. Regardless of their allelic expression pattern, initially uniform populations of stem cells gave rise to the same Nanog heterogeneity within ten cell cycles. We also found that allelic regulation of Nanog facilitates the maintenance of fractions of self-renewing cells with sufficient Nanog content to prevent aberrant loss of pluripotency in stem cell populations with restricted Nanog expression. Our findings highlight the role of allelic control of Nanog expression as a prime determinant of stem cell population heterogeneity and warrant further investigation in the contexts of stem cell specification and cell reprogramming.
The proteome is the complete set of proteins produced by an organism, and the costs and benefits of protein expression shape the evolution and regulation of proteome expression. In microbes, the rate of cellular growth is an important component of organismal fitness, and much of the microbial proteome is devoted to growth in certain environments. However, the percentage of the microbial proteome that is un-utilized in a given environment and how much the un-utilized protein fraction can vary across environments is unknown. To address this challenge, we combined a recently developed genome-scale model of proteome allocation in Escherichia coli with genome-scale absolute proteomics measurements to quantify proteome allocation across 16 distinct environments. We show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments and that accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains >95% of the variance in growth rates of Escherichia coli across 16 distinct environments. We also show that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Furthermore, we show that unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.
Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) is a complex disease influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified multiple loci associated with T2D in populations of European descent, but the transferability of these findings to other ethnic groups is not well understood. To address this, we performed GWAS in three major ethnic populations of Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Asian Indians in Singapore. Our meta-analysis of 3, 955 Chinese, 2, 034 Malays, and 2, 146 Asian Indians ( 2, 010 cases, 1, 945 controls, 794 cases, 1, 240 controls, and 977 cases, 1, 169 controls, respectively ) showed strong associations with T2D at the CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci, which have been consistently associated with T2D in multiple global populations. The effect sizes in our Chinese and Indian populations were similar or even larger than those reported in European studies, despite comparable frequencies of the implicated alleles. We also observed evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity at these loci, as well as variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations. These findings highlight the value of surveying across diverse racial/ethnic groups to fine-map causal variants and identify population-specific variants.
Cryptococcus neoformans is a basidiomycetous budding yeast in which nuclear division takes place in the daughter cell during mitosis. Here, we show that the evolutionarily conserved Aurora B kinase Ipl1 is required for timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis. Ipl1 is essential for viability and regulates structural integrity of microtubules. Ipl1-depleted cells exhibit a significant delay in kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration due to compromised stability of cytoplasmic microtubules. We previously proposed that cytoplasmic microtubules and cortical dyneins promote atypical nuclear division in C. neoformans by generating an in silico model of mitosis. By introducing additional parameters to the model, we predict that an effective cortical bias generated by cytosolic Bim1 and dynein regulates dynamics of kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. Indeed, in vivo alterations of Bim1 or dynein cellular levels delay nuclear migration. Our results suggest that Ipl1 spatio-temporally influences Bim1 or/and dynein activity along with microtubule stability to ensure timely onset of nuclear division. We propose that the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope by Ipl1 allows its own nuclear entry that helps in spatio-temporal regulation of nuclear division during semi-open mitosis in C. neoformans.
Medullary thyroid carcinoma ( MTC ) is a rare neuroendocrine tumor of the parafollicular C-cells of the thyroid. We investigated a case of aggressive MTC harboring a somatic RET p. Cys634Arg mutation, a known driver of neoplastic disease, and a germ-line RET p. Cys630= substitution, which was previously considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. Next generation sequencing ( NGS ) revealed that the two mutations were in cis, with no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis showed an increase in RET transcript levels in the patient compared to seven other MTCs harboring the p. Cys634Arg mutation. Minigene expression assays demonstrated that the p. Cys630= substitution was sufficient to explain the increased RET mRNA level. In silico analyses and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the p. Cys630= variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs that enhanced SRp55 recruitment to the mutant allele, leading to more efficient maturation of its pre-mRNA and an increased abundance of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor. These findings document a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression.
Metagenomic sequencing is a promising method for the diagnosis of human infections, as it can capture all the DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. However, complete and accurate characterization of the sequence depends on the availability and quality of genomes for comparison. Recent studies have exposed the presence of contamination in published genomes, which can increase the risk of falsely identifying the wrong pathogen. To address this problem, we have developed a bioinformatics system for eliminating contamination as well as low-complexity genomic sequences in the draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. We applied this software to a comprehensive database of all sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes and removed human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences present in these genomes. We also removed low-complexity genomic sequences, another source of false positives. Using this pipeline, we have produced a database of “clean” eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools. We demonstrate that when attempting to find eukaryotic pathogens in metagenomic samples, the new database provides better sensitivity than one using the original genomes while offering a dramatic reduction in false positives.
Trypanosoma brucei is a protozoan parasite that causes human and animal trypanosomiasis in tropical Africa. The parasite consists of three subspecies: T. b. brucei ( Tbb ), T. b. gambiense ( Tbg ), and T. b. rhodesiense ( Tbr ), which are morphologically indistinguishable but classified according to host specificity, type of disease, and geographical distribution. We evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of T. brucei in Uganda and southwestern Kenya by genotyping 269 isolates at 17 microsatellite loci and screening for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesiense. Our results show that T. brucei isolates from Uganda and southwestern Kenya can be partitioned into three distinct genetic clusters. Clusters 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies designation, host, or date of collection. Our results also show evidence of genetic admixture among the three clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and possibly on-going gene flow between them. The expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhodesiense ( Tbr ), and the emergence of human infective strains ( Tbr ) from non-infective T. b. brucei ( Tbb ) strains of different genetic backgrounds.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein ( TXNIP ) is a multifunctional protein involved in tumor suppression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. However, its role in the inflammatory process remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mice deficient in TXNIP ( Txnip−/− ) are significantly more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) -induced endotoxic shock. In response to LPS, Txnip−/− macrophages produced significantly higher levels of nitric oxide ( NO ) and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ), and an iNOS inhibitor rescued Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death, demonstrating that NO is a major factor in TXNIP-mediated endotoxic shock. This susceptibility phenotype of Txnip−/− mice occurred despite reduced IL-1β secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of NLRP3 compared to wild-type controls. These data demonstrate that TXNIP is a novel molecule that links NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock.
ZTF-8 is a conserved protein from worms to humans that plays a novel role in the repair of both mitotic and meiotic double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) as well as in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in the C. elegans germline. We show that ztf-8 mutants exhibit specific sensitivity to γ-irradiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic nuclear arrest at S-phase accompanied by activation of the ATL-1 and CHK-1 DNA damage checkpoint kinases, as well as accumulation of both mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates, indicating that ZTF-8 functions in DSB repair. ZTF-8 partially co-localizes with the 9-1-1 DNA damage response complex and interacts with MRT-2/Rad1, a component of this complex. The human RHINO protein rescues the phenotypes observed in ztf-8 mutants, suggesting functional conservation across species. We propose that ZTF-8 is involved in promoting repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic DSBs by transducing DNA damage checkpoint signaling via the 9-1-1 pathway. Our findings define a conserved function for ZTF-8/RHINO in promoting genomic stability in the germline.
Motor neuron ( MN ) progenitors in the neural tube differentiate more rapidly than other progenitors. We used single cell transcriptomics to define the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. We found that the MN determinant Olig2 plays a pivotal role just prior to MN differentiation. Olig2 represses expression of the Notch signaling pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes5. Olig2 repression of Hes5 appears to be direct, via a conserved regulatory element within the Hes5 locus that restricts expression from MN progenitors. These findings reveal a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation and demonstrate how Olig2 acts as the developmental pacemaker coordinating the spatial and temporal pattern of MN generation.
Influenza viruses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and the role of T cells in human immunity to influenza remains unclear. Here, we show that cross-reactive T cell responses play an important role in early clearance of infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus ( H1N1pdm ) in nonhuman primates. We first infected 5 rhesus macaques with a seasonal human H1N1 isolate to “prime” cellular immunity. Four months later, we challenged these animals and 7 naive controls with H1N1pdm. In naive animals, CD8+ T cells with an activated phenotype appeared in blood and lung 5–7 days post inoculation ( p. i. ) with H1N1pdm and reached peak magnitude 7–10 days p. i. In contrast, activated T cells were recruited to the lung as early as 2 days p. i. in “primed” animals, and reached peak frequencies in blood and lung 4–7 days p. i. Interferon ( IFN ) -γ Elispot and intracellular cytokine staining assays showed that the virus-specific response peaked earlier and reached a higher magnitude in “primed” animals than in naive animals. This response involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Strikingly, “primed” animals cleared H1N1pdm infection significantly earlier from the upper and lower respiratory tract than the naive animals did, and before the appearance of H1N1pdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. Our results suggest that cross-reactive T cell responses can mediate early clearance of an antigenically novel influenza virus in primates.
Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, is a zoonotic pathogen that is difficult to diagnose because of its lack of specific clinical manifestations in humans and the lack of identifiable features in infected animals. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from the acute and convalescent stages of infection, which are unavailable at early diagnosis. In this study, we developed a Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification ( LAMP ) assay to detect C. burnetii rapidly and sensitively. A universal LAMP primer set was designed to detect the repeated sequence IS1111a of the htpAB gene of C. burnetii using PrimerExplorer V4 software. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was evaluated using known quantities of recombined reference plasmids containing the targeted genes. The specificity of the developed LAMP assay was determined using 26 members of the order Rickettsiae and 18 other common pathogens. The utility of the LAMP assay was further compared with real-time PCR by examining 24 blood samples including 6 confirmed and 18 probable Q fever cases, and 126 animal samples from 4 provinces. The limits of detection of the LAMP assay for the htpAB gene were 1 copy per reaction. The specificity of the LAMP assay was 100%, and no cross-reaction was observed among the bacteria used in the study. The positive rate of unknown febrile patients was 33. 3% for the LAMP assay and 8. 3% for the real-time PCR ( P<0. 05 ). Similarly, the total positive rate of animals was 7. 9% for the LAMP assay and 0. 8% for the real-time PCR ( P<0. 01 ).
Embryonic Stem Cell (ES)-Specific Enhancers Specify the Expression Potential of ES Genes in Cancer. Cancers often display gene expression profiles that resemble those of undifferentiated cells, but the mechanisms controlling these expression programs have yet to be identified. We found that a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations, designated ES-specific enhancers ( ESSEs ) of the hematopoietic cell lineage, are particularly enriched in a group of enhancers. These ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, which are indicative of their chromatin activity states. Strikingly, ESSE methylation is associated with gene transcriptional activity in cancer. Methylated ESSEs are hypermethylated in cancer relative to normal somatic cells and co-localized with silenced genes, whereas unmethylated ESSEs tend to be hypomethylated in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Further analyses of a hypomethylated ESSE downstream to the VEGFA gene revealed a novel regulatory circuit affecting VEGFA transcript levels across cancers and patients. We suggest that the discovered enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of ES genes in cancer.
The effect of population subdivision on the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus on rugged fitness landscapes is investigated in this study. We focus on a generic and minimal model that includes population subdivision into equivalent demes connected by global migration, without requiring significant size changes of the demes, environmental heterogeneity, or specific geographic structure. We determine the optimal speedup of valley or plateau crossing that can be gained by subdivision, if the process is driven by the deme that crosses fastest. We show that isolated demes have to be in the sequential fixation regime for subdivision to significantly accelerate crossing. Using Markov chain theory, we obtain analytical expressions for the conditions under which optimal speedup is achieved: valley or plateau crossing by the subdivided population is then as fast as that of its fastest deme. We demonstrate that subdivision can substantially accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters extending beyond the optimal window. We study the effect of varying the degree of subdivision of a population, and investigate the trade-off between the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs. Finally, we extend our work to the case of a population connected by migration to one or several smaller islands, and show that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus.
Arboviruses, such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses, are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Their ability to infect, replicate and disseminate from the mosquito vector depends on the metabolic environment within the mosquito tissues. Since these viruses are enveloped, viral replication, assembly and release occur on cellular membranes primed through the manipulation of host metabolism. Here, we present the first insight into the metabolic environment induced during arbovirus replication in Aedes aegypti. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we have analyzed the temporal metabolic perturbations that occur following dengue virus infection of the midgut tissue, the primary site of infection and replication. We identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic-profile across early-, mid- and late-infection time points. We observed a marked increase in the lipid content, including glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and fatty acyls, coincident with the kinetics of viral replication. We also identified a central hub in the sphingolipid pathway that influenced dihydroceramide to ceramide ratios as critical for the virus life cycle. This study highlights biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes.
Cardiac arrhythmias are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms of these arrhythmias requires a tight integration of electrophysiological experiments, models, and theory. However, existing models of the transmembrane action potential ( AP ) are complex and varied, leading to dissimilar predictions. Here, we present a parsimonious model of the rabbit AP that is mathematically identifiable by combining a novel Hodgkin-Huxley formulation of the rapid sodium current ( INa ) with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage dependent, time-independent rectifying outward potassium current ( IK ). The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions, including dynamic current-voltage ( I-V ) relationships during the AP upstroke, rapid recovery of AP excitability during the relative refractory period, and steady-state INa inactivation via voltage clamp. Simulations of the model reproduced several important phenomena, including cellular alternans at rates > 250 bpm, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup.
During the sexual cycle of the ciliate Paramecium, the assembly of the somatic genome involves the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding germline sequences ( Internal Eliminated Sequences or IESs ). These IESs are flanked by two TA dinucleotides and their excision is initiated by the introduction of developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ), which depend on the domesticated transposase PiggyMac. The molecular steps and actors involved in the final and precise assembly of somatic genes have remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Ligase IV and Xrcc4p, core components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway ( NHEJ ), are required both for the repair of IES excision sites and for the circularization of excised IESs. The transcription of LIG4 and XRCC4 is induced early during the sexual cycle and a Lig4p-GFP fusion protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus by the time IES excision takes place. Our data indicate that IES excision is a “cut-and-close” mechanism, which involves the introduction of initiating double-strand cleavages at both ends of each IES, followed by DSB repair via highly precise end joining. This work broadens our current view on how the cellular NHEJ pathway has cooperated with domesticated transposases for the emergence of new mechanisms involved in genome dynamics.
Chagas heart disease is a major cause of death in patients with heart failure. However, the mode of death in patients with Chagas heart disease has not been well understood since the introduction of drugs that changed the natural history of heart failure. We sought to study the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease and compare it with non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. We analyzed 342 patients from the REMADHE trial and grouped them according to etiology ( Chagas vs non-Chagas ) and mode of death. The primary end-point was all-cause, heart failure and sudden death mortality. The cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas patients. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups. In the Cox regression model, Chagas etiology, left ventricular end diastolic diameter, creatinine clearance and use of amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure mortality. Left ventricular end diastolic diameter and use of beta-blocker were independently associated with sudden death mortality. Our findings suggest that in severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death. These data challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications for the selection of treatment choices.
Geminiviruses, a type of plant virus, interfere with the NIK1-mediated defense signaling pathway in Arabidopsis by suppressing the kinase activity of the transmembrane receptor-like kinase NIK1. NIK1 is a specific partner and substrate of the geminivirus nuclear shuttle protein ( NSP ) and functions as an immediate downstream effector of the NIK1-mediated response. We identified a ribosomal protein, rpL10A, as a specific partner and substrate of NIK1 that functions as an immediate downstream effector of the NIK1-mediated response. Phosphorylation of cytosolic rpL10A by NIK1 redirects the protein to the nucleus where it may act to modulate viral infection. The NIK1-mediated defense signaling pathway neither activates RNA silencing nor promotes a hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth and development. Geminivirus infection directly interferes with NIK1-mediated nuclear relocalization of rpL10A as a counterdefensive measure by suppressing NIK1 kinase activity through NSP-specific binding to the kinase domain. As a result, rpL10A is trapped within the cytoplasm as punctate corpuscles to prevent the establishment of a host environment that disfavors virus proliferation and/or spread. Furthermore, loss of rpL10A function enhances susceptibility to geminivirus infection, resembling the phenotype of nik1 null alleles.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a thermally dimorphic pathogenic fungus that causes paracoccidioidomycosis in humans. To survive inside the host, P. brasiliensis must adapt to different conditions, including the oxidative stress imposed by immune cells. In this study, we investigated the role of alternative oxidase ( AOX ), an enzyme involved in intracellular redox balancing, during host-P. brasiliensis interaction. We generated a mitotically stable P. brasiliensis AOX ( PbAOX ) antisense RNA ( aRNA ) strain with a 70% reduction in gene expression. We evaluated the relevance of PbAOX during interaction of conidia and yeast cells with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages and in a mouse model of infection. Our results show that PbAOX is important in the fungal defense against oxidative stress imposed by immune cells and is relevant in the virulence of P. brasiliensis. We observed that PbAOX-aRNA conidia and yeast cells had decreased viability after interaction with macrophages. In a mouse model of infection, we showed that absence of wild-type levels of PbAOX in P. brasiliensis results in a reduced fungal burden in lungs at weeks 8 and 24 post-challenge and an increased survival rate. In the presence of H2O2, we observed that PbWt yeast cells increased PbAOX expression and presented a higher viability in comparison with PbAOX-aRNA yeast cells. These data further support the hypothesis that PbAOX is important in the fungal defense against oxidative stress imposed by immune cells and is relevant in the virulence of P. brasiliensis.
Place cells in the hippocampus are thought to support episodic-like memory through attractor dynamics, in which the spatial map of place cells encodes contextual information through firing rate variability. To test whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells, recent experiments morphed one familiar context into another while observing the responses of CA3 cell ensembles. The results suggested a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations, as the average population activity in CA3 transitioned gradually rather than abruptly from one familiar context to the next. However, individual CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and some displayed hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics. We developed a neural network model of the CA3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts to understand whether these seemingly conflicting results are commensurate with attractor network theory. We found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels. These results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells.
Entamoeba histolytica, a microaerophilic protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and extra intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. We investigated the metabolic responses of E. histolytica trophozoites to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide ( H2O2 ) and paraquat ( PQ ) by measuring charged metabolites on capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We found that oxidative stress caused drastic modulation of metabolites involved in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino acid metabolism. Oxidative stress resulted in the inhibition of glycolysis as a result of inactivation of several key enzymes, leading to the redirection of metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. As a result of the repression of glycolysis, the levels of nucleoside triphosphates were decreased. We also showed for the first time the presence of a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica as demonstrated by the increased production of glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol upon oxidative stress. We proposed the significance of the glycerol biosynthetic pathway as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E. histolytica.
IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate, and its dynamic expression pattern is required for proper hematopoiesis. IKAROS interacts with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacetylase ( NuRD ) complex and the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor b ( P-TEFb ) to regulate gene expression. Here, we demonstrate that IKAROS recruits the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to specific genes and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring the Protein Phosphatase 1α ( PP1α ), an IKAROS-binding protein and P-TEFb activator, to CDK9. The expression level of IKAROS influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to gene regulatory regions. We show that an IKAROS mutant that is unable to bind PP1α cannot sustain gene expression and impedes normal differentiation of IkNULL hematopoietic progenitors. Finally, the knock-down of the NuRD subunit Mi2 reveals that the occupancy of the NuRD complex at transcribed regions of genes favors the relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and thereby, promotes transcription elongation. Our data also reveal that the dynamic interaction of IKAROS with the NuRD-P-TEFb complex depends on IKAROS protein levels and that IKAROS-PP1α protein interaction is required for normal hematopoietic differentiation of primary HPCs.
Rabies virus ( RABV ) is an emerging disease of public health significance in the Caribbean island of Trinidad. We investigated the evolutionary history and phylogeography of RABV associated with outbreaks in Trinidad using molecular characterisation and a Bayesian phylogeographic approach. Trinidadian RABV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus ( vampire bat ) related sequences. They fell into two largely temporally defined lineages: Trinidad I ( 1997–2000 ) and Trinidad II ( 2000–2010 ). The Trinidad I lineage was most closely related to RABV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela, while the Trinidad II lineage was most closely related to RABV from Brazil and Uruguay. Phylogeographic analyses support three separate RABV introductions from the mainland, from which each of the three Trinidadian lineages arose. The estimated dates for the introductions and subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution within Trinidad following each introduction. These data also indicate co-circulation of Trinidad lineage I and IIa during 2000.
Cortical area development in the mammalian brain is dependent on the expression patterns of several genes. However, our current understanding of the regulatory interactions between these genes is qualitative and incomplete. We used a Boolean model to determine which interactions and combinations of interactions occur in networks that reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns of Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8 along the anterior-posterior axis. The model treats expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of the expression data currently available. We simulated gene expression patterns created by all possible networks containing the five genes of interest and found that only of these networks were able to reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These networks all lacked certain interactions and combinations of interactions, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. An analysis of the probability of each interaction gave an indication of which interactions are most likely to be present in the gene network regulating cortical area development. We found that repressive interactions are much more likely than inductive ones, but that mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. Overall, our model illuminates the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development and makes novel predictions that can be tested experimentally.
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins play a crucial role in organism development by regulating the expression of developmental genes. PcG proteins achieve this through the PRC2-mediated methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) and PRC1-mediated ubiquitylation of histone H2A on lysine 119 (uH2A). Bmi1 is an integral component of PRC1 and has been shown to be critical for H2A ubiquitylation. Here, we report the genome-wide localization of Bmi1-dependent uH2A in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells using ChIP-Seq technology. Gene promoter averaging analysis reveals a peak of uH2A just inside the transcription start site (TSS) of well-annotated genes. This peak is enriched at promoters containing the H3K27me3 mark and represents the least expressed genes in wild-type MEF cells. In addition, peak finding reveals regions of local uH2A enrichment throughout the mouse genome, including almost 700 gene promoters. Genes with promoter peaks of uH2A exhibit lower-level expression compared to genes that do not contain promoter peaks of uH2A. Moreover, we demonstrate that genes with uH2A peaks have increased expression upon Bmi1 knockout. Importantly, local enrichment of uH2A is not limited to regions containing the H3K27me3 mark. We also describe the enrichment of H2A ubiquitylation at high-density CpG promoters and provide evidence to suggest that DNA methylation may be linked to uH2A at these regions.
Pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA ( PINC ) and retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 ( RbAp46 ) are upregulated in alveolar cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in alveolar cells that remain in the regressed lobules following involution. We show that, in the post-pubertal mouse mammary gland, mPINC is enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitors. mPINC levels increase throughout pregnancy and then decline in early lactation, when alveolar cells undergo terminal differentiation. This reduction in mPINC levels may be necessary for lactation, as overexpression of mPINC in HC11 mammary epithelial cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of mPINC enhances differentiation. We demonstrate that mPINC interacts with RbAp46, as well as other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ), and identify potential targets of mPINC that are differentially expressed following modulation of mPINC expression levels. Our data suggest that mPINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy to prevent abundant milk production and secretion until parturition. Additionally, a PRC2 complex that includes mPINC and RbAp46 may confer epigenetic modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland.
PML/TRIM19, a member of the tripartite motif ( TRIM ) protein family, plays a role in antiviral defense, but its effect on HIV-1 infection is unclear. Here, we show that HIV-1 and other retroviruses trigger the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies as early as 30 minutes post-infection, which last approximately 8 hours with a peak at 2 hours post-infection. PML re-localization is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors and is not observed following infection with unrelated viruses, suggesting it is specifically triggered by retroviral reverse-transcription. We show that PML interferes with an early step of retroviral infection since PML knockdown dramatically increases reverse-transcription efficiency. We demonstrate that PML does not inhibit retroviral infection directly but acts through the stabilization of Daxx. In the presence of PML, cytoplasmic Daxx is found in the vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse-transcription. Daxx not only interferes with exogenous retroviral infections but also inhibits retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses, thus identifying Daxx as a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription.
Protein multiple structure alignment is a computationally prohibitive problem, even when there is agreement on what measure the alignment should optimize. One approach is aligned fragment pair chaining, where short structural fragments are aligned against each other optimally and then chained together in geometrically consistent ways. Ye and Godzik have suggested that adding geometric flexibility may help better model protein structures. We introduce Matt, an aligned fragment pair chaining algorithm that allows local flexibility between fragments in intermediate steps. Small translations and rotations are temporarily allowed to bring sets of aligned fragments closer, even if they are physically impossible under rigid body transformations. After a dynamic programming assembly guided by these “bent” alignments, geometric consistency is restored in the final step. Matt is tested against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on the Homstrad and SABmark benchmark datasets. Matt's global performance is competitive with the other programs on Homstrad, but outperforms the other programs on SABmark, a benchmark of multiple structure alignments of proteins with more distant homology. Matt demonstrates an ability to better align the ends of α-helices and β-strands, an important characteristic of any structure alignment program intended to help construct a structural template library for threading approaches to the inverse protein-folding problem. We postulate that Matt's strong performance comes from its ability to model proteins in different conformational states and its ability to model backbone distortions in more distantly related proteins.
Greatwall ( Gwl ) and Ensa/ARPP19 are key regulators of mitotic entry and exit. Gwl inactivates the counteracting phosphatase PP2A/B55 via its substrates Ensa and ARPP19. However, the dynamic regulation of Gwl activity and the phosphatases that control Gwl kinase and its substrates are poorly understood. To address these questions, we applied a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments using phospho-specific antibodies to monitor Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19 and Cdk substrate phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit. We demonstrate that PP2A/B55 is required for Gwl dephosphorylation at the essential Cdk site Thr194. We also show that Ensa/ARPP19 dephosphorylation is mediated by the RNA Polymerase II carboxy terminal domain phosphatase Fcp1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of neither Fcp1 nor PP2A appears to block dephosphorylation of the bulk of mitotic Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit. Our results suggest a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19 and Cdk substrate dephosphorylation during mitotic exit.
Escape from autologous neutralizing antibodies ( Nab ) is a major obstacle in the development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of escape from Nab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection. Despite the development of high titer autologous Nab, viral escape readily occurred in both subjects. To understand the escape pathways, we created a series of envelope ( Env ) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a corresponding newly transmitted Env. In one subject, escape was driven predominantly by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain ( V3V5 ). In the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. The findings suggest that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and that multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.
Positive and negative selection vary across different portions of plant genomes, but the extent of this variation remains poorly understood. Here, we quantify the amount of selection across the genome of 13 Capsella grandiflora individuals. We show that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, with the exception of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ) and conserved noncoding sequences ( CNSs ) that are conserved across the Brassicaceae family. Estimates of selection on CNSs show strong signals of selection. We also observe reductions in neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Using expression data from leaf tissue, we show that genes that are more highly expressed experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. Overall, we observe widespread positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but our results also suggest that both positive and negative selection on plant noncoding sequence are considerably rarer than in animal genomes.
EBNA2, a transcriptional regulator encoded by Epstein-Barr Virus ( EBV ), drives the cooperative and combinatorial genome-wide binding of two master regulators of B-cell fate, namely EBF1 and RBP-jκ. EBNA2 induces the formation of new binding sites for both RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with transcriptional activation of linked genes that are important for B-lymphoblast function. Our findings suggest that EBV type III latency promotes a B-cell marginal zone developmental program, as the number of RBP-jκ binding sites is largely increased. EBNA2 colocalizes with EBF1 and RBP-jκ at many enhancer and super-enhancer regions in EBV positive lymphoblastoid cell lines. EBNA2 increases the stability and probability of RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding to a specific group of genomic sites and regulatory elements. These findings reveal that EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival.
The Neovolcanic axis ( NVA ) in Mexico acts as a barrier to gene flow among Aedes aegypti populations that differ in vector competence for dengue 2 virus ( DENV2 ). Aedes aegypti is the primary mosquito vector of the four serotypes of dengue virus. Previous studies have shown that Ae. aegypti populations in Mexico are genetically structured and differ in their ability to transmit dengue viruses. We found that Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the NVA differ in their vector competence for DENV2. The average vector competence rate for Ae. aegypti from populations north of the NVA was 0. 55, while the average vector competence rate for Ae. aegypti from populations south of the NVA was 0. 20. Most of this variation was due to midgut infection and escape barriers. In Ae. aegypti north of the NVA, 21. 5% failed to develop midgut infections and 30. 3% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection. In contrast, in Ae. aegypti south of the NVA, 45. 2% failed to develop midgut infections and 62. 8% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection.
Replication in Escherichia coli is driven by the DnaA protein, which cycles between the active ATP-bound form and the inactive ADP-bound form. It has been suggested that DnaA is the main controller of initiation frequency, and that initiation occurs when enough ATP-DnaA has accumulated. However, we have found that cells with more than a 50% increase in the concentration of ATP-DnaA showed no changes in timing of replication. This suggests that although ATP-DnaA is the main actor in initiation of replication, its accumulation does not control the time of initiation. Instead, other factors are required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell’s environment. We propose that E. coli has a robust replication cycle driven by the cycling of the levels of ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA, and that initiation cannot occur unless sufficient amounts of ATP-DnaA at the origin of replication ( oriC ) have licensed this event. We also propose that signals depending on the cell’s environment govern the exact timing of initiation. Our results argue that the DnaA protein, although it constitutes the key feature of the cell cycle motor, is not the limiting factor for precise timing of initiation of replication.
Granger causality is a statistical method used to determine the direction of causality in multivariate time series data. We introduce a novel approach called partial Granger causality to reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous inputs and latent variables in the frequency domain. This method is extensively tested with toy models and successfully applied to experimental datasets, including gene microarray data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo multi-electrode array ( MEA ) local field potentials ( LFPs ) recorded from the inferotemporal cortex of a sheep, and in vivo LFPs recorded from distributed sites in the right hemisphere of a macaque monkey. We demonstrate that an ad hoc definition of causality such as partial directed coherence ( PDC ) in the frequency domain can be misleading, as it often yields contradicting results between the time domain Granger causality and the frequency domain Granger causality.
Local ancestry inference in recently admixed individuals, such as Latino Americans, plays a major role in medical and population genetic inferences. Most existing methods for local ancestry inference are designed for use with genotyping arrays and fail to make use of the full spectrum of data available from sequencing. Here we present new methods for local ancestry inference that leverage continent-specific variants ( CSVs ) to attain increased performance over existing approaches in sequenced admixed genomes. Our approach incorporates the admixed genomes themselves jointly with public datasets, such as 1000 Genomes, to improve the accuracy of CSV calling. We use simulations to show that our approach attains accuracy similar to widely used computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches with large decreases in runtime. We extend our approach to account for low-coverage sequencing and show that accurate local ancestry inference can be attained at low sequencing coverage. Finally, we generalize CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants ( sCSVs ) and show that in some cases it is possible to determine the sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments on the basis of sCSVs. Our approach makes use of alleles that are found to be present only in individuals from a given continental group. We have shown that the density of such CSVs is high enough across the genome to allow for fast and accurate inference of local ancestry.
Circadian periodicity in gene expression has been described in the hypothalamus and multiple peripheral tissues in mammals, with 10%–15% of all genes oscillating in a daily rhythm regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses of periodicity have been limited by the small size of datasets and high levels of stochastic noise. Here, we propose a new approach that applies digital signal processing algorithms separately to each group of genes oscillating in the same phase, combined with statistical tests for periodicity. This method identifies circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of all expressed genes. Consequently, circadian oscillation in gene expression should be evaluated in any study related to biological pathways. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations or regulation of environmental factors should be considered in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations.
Recombination is a key process in evolutionary biology and genetics that generates genetic diversity. However, the precise location of both crossover ( CO ) and non-crossover ( NCO ) recombination events has been difficult to determine. To gain insight into recombination in an avian system, we performed whole-genome re-sequencing of a three-generation pedigree of the collared flycatcher. We identified 325 CO events at a median resolution of 1. 4 kb, with 86% of the events localized to regions < 10 kb. Observed CO rates were in agreement with data from linkage mapping and were higher in male ( 3. 56 cM/Mb ) than in female meiosis ( 2. 28 cM/Mb ). CO events were non-randomly distributed in the genome with several distinct hot-spots and a concentration to genic regions. We further identified 267 NCO events, whose location was significantly associated with CO locations. We detected a significant transmission bias in favour of ‘strong’ ( G, C ) over ‘weak’ ( A, T ) alleles at NCO events, providing direct evidence for the process of GC-biased gene conversion in an avian system.
Repeat-proteins are a class of polypeptides composed of near repetitions of 20– to 40–amino acid stretches that fold up into non-globular, elongated architectures. The inherent symmetries in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure of repeat-proteins can be analyzed as a quasi–one-dimensional problem. We present a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, whose collective ensemble are treated as spin variables. The overall folding properties of a complete “domain” ( the stability and cooperativity of the repeating array ) can be derived from this microscopic description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies there are simple relations for the experimental observables: folding free-energy ( ΔGwater ) and the cooperativity of denaturation ( m-value ). We show how the parameters for the “coarse-grained” description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. We present a case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide ( TPR ) repeat proteins and quantitatively relate the results to the experimentally observed folding transitions. We speculate that natural repeat proteins are “poised” at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions.
Hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism are major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ). These conditions lead to activation of the integrated stress response ( ISR ) or unfolded protein response ( UPR ), but the extent to which these stress pathways influence HCC pathogenesis has not been tested. Here, we show that the ISR-regulated transcription factor CHOP promotes liver cancer. CHOP expression is up-regulated in liver tumors in human HCC and two mouse models thereof. We demonstrate that CHOP-null mice are resistant to chemical hepatocarcinogenesis and exhibit attenuation of both apoptosis and cellular proliferation. These mice are also resistant to fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Global gene expression profiling suggests that deletion of CHOP reduces the levels of basal inflammatory signaling in the liver. Our results are consistent with a model whereby CHOP contributes to hepatic carcinogenesis by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation.
Leishmania aethiopica is the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) in Ethiopia and can cause severe and complicated cases such as diffuse CL ( DCL ), mucocutaneous leishmaniasis or extensive CL. Despite the substantial burden, evidence-based treatment guidelines are lacking. We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies reporting on treatment outcomes of CL due to L aethiopica to help identify potentially efficacious medications for clinical trials. We identified 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL presumably due to L aethiopica. The most commonly used drugs were antimonials ( n = 201 ), pentamidine ( n = 150 ) and cryotherapy ( n = 103 ). The majority of studies reported on patients being treated in L aethiopica endemic regions, but only three of these studies did species identification in all reported cases. The evidence-base for treatment of complicated CL due to L aethiopica is extremely limited. While antimonials remain the most available CL treatment in Ethiopia, their efficacy and safety in CL should be better defined. Most importantly, alternative first line treatments ( such as miltefosine or paromomycin ) should be explored. High quality trials on CL due to L aethiopica are urgently needed, exploring group sequential methods to evaluate several options in parallel.
Circadian rhythms are daily oscillations in physiological and behavioral processes that are controlled by an internal biological clock. In this study, we have reconstituted a circadian oscillator in vitro with three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, that displays the salient properties of circadian rhythms, including self-sustained 24-h periodicity that is temperature compensated. We have analyzed the biochemical basis of this oscillator by quantifying the time-dependent interactions of the three proteins by electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis to elucidate the timing of the formation of complexes among the Kai proteins. The data are used to derive a dynamic model for the in vitro oscillator that accurately reproduces the rhythms of KaiABC complexes and of KaiC phosphorylation, and is consistent with biophysical observations of individual Kai protein interactions. We have also used fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) to confirm that monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers occurs. The model demonstrates that the function of this monomer exchange may be to maintain synchrony among the KaiC hexamers in the reaction, thereby sustaining a high-amplitude oscillation. Finally, we have applied the first perturbation analyses of an in vitro oscillator by using temperature pulses to reset the phase of the KaiABC oscillator, thereby testing the resetting characteristics of this unique circadian oscillator.
The relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and behavioral performance has been extensively studied in event-related potential ( ERP ) studies. However, the vast majority of these studies have only investigated a monotonic relationship between the two. Recent findings suggest that across-trial variability can correlate with behavioral performance independent of trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U- shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output. Using electrocorticography ( ECoG ) in patients undergoing invasive brain monitoring for neurosurgical treatment, we found strong evidence for an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual stimulus detection task. When the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity is closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times are faster. This relationship is present not only in the post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity, but also in the pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory brain dynamics. Our findings are consistent with the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and support attractor network theories, which postulate that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance, and proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance.
Sexual development is a key evolutionary innovation of eukaryotes, and mating compatibility in fungi is governed by the mating type ( MAT ) loci. In basidiomycetes, the ancestral state is hypothesized to be tetrapolar, with two genetically unlinked MAT loci containing homeodomain transcription factor genes ( HD locus ) and pheromone and pheromone receptor genes ( P/R locus ). However, there are also basidiomycetes with bipolar mating systems, which can arise through genomic linkage of the HD and P/R loci. In the order Tremellales, bipolarity is found only in the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. Here, we describe the analysis of MAT loci from 24 species of the Trichosporonales, a sister order to the Tremellales. In all of the species analyzed, the MAT loci are fused and a single HD gene is present in each mating type, similar to the organization in the pathogenic Cryptococci. However, the HD and P/R allele combinations in the Trichosporonales are different from those in the pathogenic Cryptococci. This suggests that fusion of the HD and P/R loci occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and pathogenic Cryptococci, supporting the hypothesis of convergent evolution towards fused MAT regions. The gene content and gene order within the fused MAT loci are highly conserved in the Trichosporonales, and there is no apparent suppression of recombination extending from the MAT loci to adjacent chromosomal regions.
Chagas disease, the most important vector-borne disease in Latin America, is caused by non-domiciliated vectors such as Triatoma dimidiata in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. While regional initiatives have successfully controlled domiciliated vectors, non-domiciliated vectors remain responsible for a significant transmission risk. A mathematical model was developed to predict the temporal variations in abundance of non-domiciliated vectors inside houses. The model was fitted to two years of field data from the Yucatán Peninsula and accurately predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found to be effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction in bug abundance, and it decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. In contrast, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. Our results suggest that control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying, but that insect screens may offer an effective and sustainable alternative for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
Feather patterning in avian skin relies on an integrated reaction-diffusion-taxis system that involves coupled fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling together with mesenchymal cell movement. This system is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration occurring through a positive feedback loop centred on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, mechanically compressing the epidermis to rapidly intensify FGF20 expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of Ectodysplasin A ( EDA ), which initiates the expression of FGF20. The EDA wave spreads across a mesenchymal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchymal cells required to begin to form a feather bud. In flighted birds, the key role of the EDA/Ectodysplasin A receptor ( EDAR ) pathway in vertebrate skin patterning has been recast to activate this process in a quasi-1-dimensional manner, imposing highly ordered pattern formation. We find that the skin of chicken, duck, ostrich, and emu embryos have pronounced differences in their feather arrangements. The absence of FGF20 in the scaleless mutant leads to a failure of feather primordium formation, demonstrating a defining role for the epidermis in avian skin patterning.
Filoviruses, which include Ebola and Marburg viruses, can be present in the body fluids of infected people and survivors. A rapid systematic review of 33 studies found that filoviruses were detected in most types of body fluids, but not in every sample from every patient. The presence of filoviruses in body fluids was highly variable, and most body fluids taken more than 16 days after the onset of illness were usually negative. In the six studies that used both RT-PCR tests for filovirus RNA and tissue culture, RT-PCR tests gave positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture. This suggests that most non-blood, RT-PCR positive samples are likely to be culture negative and possibly of low infectious risk. However, it is not apparent how relatively infectious many body fluids are during or after illness, even when culture-positive, because most test results come from more severe cases. Contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission because of the known high viral loads in blood.
Neuronal spike timing adaptation can be described with a fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model in which the exponent of the fractional derivative can vary from 0 to 1, with 1 representing the normal derivative. This model can reproduce upward and downward spike adaptations found experimentally in neocortical pyramidal cells and tectal neurons in vitro by varying only the fractional exponent. The model also produces spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability with power-law distribution. The fractional model generates reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input and reflects the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation. In this context, the fractional order leaky integrate-and-fire model is a unified mathematical and computational framework that can be used to describe power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity. The fractional derivative can capture relationships between the distribution of conductances that can be complicated to model using explicit techniques. The emergent effect of these membrane correlations is a non-Markovian process that can be modeled with a fractional derivative, representing a non-local process in which the value of the variable is determined by integrating a temporal weighted voltage trace, also called the memory trace.
Paracoccidioides spp., the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, is able to defend itself against reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) produced by host effector cells by expressing different antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases ( SODs ). In this study, we identified six SODs isoforms encoded by the Paracoccidioides genome and determined their expression levels in representative isolates of the phylogenetic lineages of Paracoccidioides spp. ( S1, PS2, PS3 and Pb01-like ). We found that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 were similarly expressed during the yeast phase, while in mycelia PbSOD1 expression was slightly higher for S1, PS2 and P. lutzii isolates. Importantly, we observed an increased expression of PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 during the transition process, exposure to oxidative agents and interaction with phagocytic cells, suggesting that these proteins could assist in combating the superoxide radicals generated during the host-pathogen interaction. Using PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 knockdown strains we showed that these genes are involved in the response of the fungus against host effector cells, particularly the oxidative stress response, and in a mouse model of infection. Our data suggest that PbSOD3 expression is linked with a pronounced extracellular activity while PbSOD1 seems more related to intracellular requirements of the fungus.
Intrinsically disordered/unstructured proteins ( IDPs ) are extremely sensitive to proteolysis in vitro, but show no enhanced degradation rates in vivo. It has been suggested that IDPs are preferentially associated with chaperones in the cell, which may offer protection against degradation by proteases. To test this inference, we analyzed pairwise interaction data from high-throughput interaction studies to see if predicted disorder correlates with the tendency of chaperone binding by proteins. Our major finding is that disorder predicted by the IUPred algorithm actually shows negative correlation with chaperone binding in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa species. This means that IDPs in the cell tend to avoid being bound to chaperones. The effect may be correlated with the presence of ordered domains, as observed with Pfam domains. We also found that binding of chaperones to disordered proteins is frequently accompanied by binding to other proteins, suggesting that IDPs use chaperones not for folding, but for assistance with association with other proteins.
The Drosophila genes spalt major ( salm ) and spalt-related ( salr ) encode Zn-finger transcription factors that are regulated by the Decapentaplegic ( Dpp ) signalling pathway in the wing imaginal disc. These transcription factors are required for cell survival and proliferation in the central region of the wing disc, as well as for vein patterning in the lateral regions. To identify direct Salm and Salr target genes, we compared the expression profile of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs in microarray experiments. We found that candidate Salm/Salr target genes include both genes whose expression is turned off and genes whose expression is positively regulated by Salm/Salr. Furthermore, loss-of-function phenotypic analysis of these genes indicates that a fraction of them are required for wing growth and patterning. The identification and analysis of candidate Salm/Salr target genes opens a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing, linking the activity of the Dpp pathway to the development of this epithelial tissue. Our analysis uncovered an unsuspected complexity in the transcriptional landscape regulated by Salm/Salr, consisting of batteries of activated and repressed genes.
Protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) is a critical regulator of centriole duplication in the C. elegans embryo. We have identified two PP1 orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators, I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22, as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels. ZYG-1 is the C. elegans homolog of Plk4 and is required for centriole duplication. Down-regulation of PP1 activity either directly or by mutation of szy-2 or sds-22 can rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. This is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels. Our data indicate that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism. While moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication to a zyg-1 mutant, strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification via the production of more than one daughter centriole. Our results thus define a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle.
Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a zoonotic disease that has been expanding rapidly in Brazil. In the municipality of Campinas, southeastern Brazil, the first autochthonous case of VL was reported in 2009 in a dog living in an upscale residential condominium located inside an environmentally protected area ( EPA ). Since then, disease transmission has remained restricted to dogs inhabiting two geographically contiguous condominiums within the EPA. We conducted a cross-sectional study to investigate Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals and sand flies using molecular tools and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1. 5% and 1. 2% were observed in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six species of sand flies were identified as potential vectors or transmitters of Leishmania, including Lutzomyia longipalpis, the main vector of VL in Brazil. Natural infection by L. ( L. ) infantum was recorded in one sand fly and two wild mammals, a white-eared opossum ( Didelphis albiventris ), a known reservoir of VL. The proximity between infected animals, human residences and forest areas suggests that the EPA has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in similar scenarios, i. e. wild areas that undergo environmental modifications, is evident.
Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) is a highly metastatic type of tumor that is frequently reported in South Asia. Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) is an oncogenic virus that is closely associated with NPC, and several viral proteins have been found to promote the migration and invasiveness of NPC cells. However, not all tumor tissues express these viral oncoproteins, suggesting that other mechanisms may contribute to the aggressive behavior of NPC tumor cells. In this study, we investigated the role of the EBV-encoded microRNA miR-BART9 in NPC. We found that miR-BART9 is highly expressed in all EBV-positive NPC tissues and promotes the migration and invasiveness of NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. Computational analysis revealed that miR-BART9 may target E-cadherin, a membrane protein that is pivotal in preserving cell-cell junctions and the epithelial phenotype. Through biochemical assays and functional rescue analysis, we confirmed that miR-BART9 specifically inhibits E-cadherin to induce a mesenchymal-like phenotype and promote the migration of NPC cells. These results indicated that miR-BART9 is a prometastatic viral miRNA and suggested that high levels of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive NPC cells may contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor cells. Our findings indicate that miR-BART9 is a significant viral contributor to the migratory and invasive capability of EBV-infected tumor cells.
We present ggsashimi, a command-line tool for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. Given a genomic region, ggsashimi creates sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software. ggsashimi uses popular bioinformatics file formats, is annotation-independent, and allows the visualization of splicing events even for large genomic regions by scaling down the genomic segments between splice sites. It is freely available at https://github. com/guigolab/ggsashimi. ggsashimi is implemented in Python and internally generates R code for plotting. The tool was developed to address the limitations of current sashimi plot implementations, including the need for specialized annotation formats and the inability to visualize splicing events for large genomic regions. ggsashimi eliminates the need for specialized annotation formats and supports summarized views for hundreds of samples. We compared ggsashimi with the sashimi-plot built-in available within the Integrative Genomics Viewer ( IGV ) and found that ggsashimi provides enhanced visualization of splicing events by applying aggregation of samples belonging to the same group and shrinkage of intron lengths.
We propose a probabilistic model of cis-regulatory module ( CRM ) evolution that captures different modes of evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites ( TFBSs ) and background sequences. The model explicitly treats the special properties of CRM sequences, including substitutions and indels in background sequences, and constraints and turnover of TFBSs. We present a computational framework that uses this model to solve the problems of CRM alignment and prediction. Our alignment method is similar to existing methods of statistical alignment but uses conserved binding sites to improve alignment. Our CRM prediction method deals with the inherent uncertainties of binding site annotations and sequence alignment in a probabilistic framework. We demonstrate that our program is able to improve both alignment and prediction of CRM sequences over several state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real data. We also use alignments produced by our program to study binding site conservation in genome-wide binding data of key transcription factors in the Drosophila blastoderm, with two intriguing results: ( i ) the factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm and ( ii ) binding sites in distal bound sequences tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions. Our approach is implemented as software, EMMA ( Evolutionary Model-based cis-regulatory Module Analysis ), ready to be applied in a broad biological context.
The piRNA ( PIWI-interacting RNA ) pathway in Drosophila is known to silence transposons in the germline. However, it is unclear if this pathway has additional functions during development. Here we show that mutations in the Drosophila piRNA pathway genes, armi, aub, ago3, and rhi, lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during the cleavage stage of embryonic divisions. Additionally, aub and armi show defects in telomere resolution during meiosis and the cleavage divisions; and mutations in lig-IV, which disrupt non-homologous end joining, suppress these fusions. By contrast, lig-IV mutations enhance chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show that aub and armi mutations disrupt telomere binding of HOAP, which is a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduce expression of a subpopulation of 19- to 22-nt telomere-specific piRNAs. Mutations in rhi and ago3, by contrast, do not block HOAP binding or production of these piRNAs. These findings uncover genetically separable functions for the Drosophila piRNA pathway. The aub, armi, rhi, and ago3 genes silence transposons and maintain chromosome integrity during cleavage-stage embryonic divisions. However, the aub and armi genes have an additional function in assembly of the telomere protection complex.
In November 2007, a large hemorrhagic fever ( HF ) outbreak was reported in Bundibugyo District, Western Uganda. The outbreak was caused by a newly discovered ebolavirus species, named Bundibugyo ebolavirus, which is distantly related to the Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus found in western Africa. The new virus was identified using a combination of classic laboratory methods and a recently developed random-primed pyrosequencing approach. The outbreak resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths, with a case fatality rate of approximately 36%. This is lower than the case fatality rates observed for Zaire ebolavirus ( 80–90% ) and Sudan ebolavirus ( 50–55% ). The new virus was detected in eight specimens using a broadly reactive ebolavirus antigen capture assay and an IgM capture assay based on Zaire ebolavirus reagents. The Uganda Virus Research Institute was able to quickly transfer antigen-capture, IgM, IgG, and real-time PCR assays to the affected area to facilitate rapid identification and isolation of Ebola cases for efficient control of the outbreak. The discovery of Bundibugyo ebolavirus has important implications for the design of future diagnostic assays to monitor Ebola HF disease in humans and animals, as well as ongoing efforts to develop effective antivirals and vaccines.
Alzheimer's disease ( AD ) is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity in its progression patterns among patients. The Global Deterioration Scale ( GDS ) and Functional Assessment Staging procedure ( FAST ) describe seven stages in the course of AD from normal aging to severe dementia. However, there has been no quantitative study of the amount of heterogeneity in AD progression rates and their variances among patients for each stage of AD. To address this, we used statistical analysis to reconstruct GDS/FAST stage durations in a cohort of 648 AD patients with an average follow-up time of 4. 78 years. We found that the standard deviations for GDS/FAST stages 4–6 are comparable with their mean durations, indicating large variations in the AD progression among patients. This is consistent with the existence of several sub-groups of AD patients, which differ by their patterns of decline. Our findings are consistent with previous reports of high variability in the temporal progression of AD, with patients transiting the stages of the disease having time-courses ranging from months to decades. The underlying reasons for such variations remain largely uncertain, and it is plausible that a combination of many different factors is responsible for a high variability of AD progression rates.
Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus has been shown to be a superior adaptation strategy compared to conventional synaptic plasticity and neuronal turnover in a simplified hippocampal memory model. Here, we extend this model to include realistic, spatially driven input firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex. We compare network performance across a sequence of spatial environments using three distinct adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. We confirm that additive neurogenesis is a superior adaptation strategy when using realistic, spatially structured input patterns. We then show that a more biologically plausible neurogenesis rule that incorporates cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells has an overall performance significantly better than any one of the three individual strategies operating alone. This adaptation rule can be tailored to maximise performance of the network when operating as either a short- or long-term memory store. We also examine the time course of adult neurogenesis over the lifetime of an animal raised under different hypothetical rearing conditions. Finally, we show that place cells can emerge and refine in a realistic manner in our model as a direct result of the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer.
Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African trypanosomiasis, expresses three virtually identical glutathione peroxidase ( Px ) -type enzymes in the cytosol ( Px I–II ) and mitochondrion ( Px III ). These enzymes detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides and can be replaced by α-tocopherol or Trolox. In the absence of cytosolic Px I and Px II, parasites undergo rapid lipid peroxidation and cell lysis. We show that the lysosome is the primary site of oxidative damage and that cytosolic trypanothione/tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases protect the lysosome from iron-induced membrane peroxidation. This process is closely linked to the high endocytic rate and distinct iron acquisition mechanisms of the infective stage of T. brucei. The respective knockout of cytosolic Px I–II in the procyclic insect form resulted in cells that were fully viable in Trolox-free medium.
Melanocytes are pigment cells that produce eumelanin, the pigment responsible for skin, hair, and eye color. Melanosomes are organelles within melanocytes where eumelanin accumulates and is transferred to keratinocytes. Melanophilin ( PMEL ) is an amyloidogenic protein that forms intralumenal fibrils within early stage melanosomes. Here, we report that inactivation of the Pmel gene ( Pmel−/− ) results in spherical melanosomes in melanocytes from hair, skin, and eye tissues. This is in contrast to the rod-shaped melanosomes present in wild-type animals. The Pmel−/− mice are fully viable, fertile, and display no obvious developmental defects. However, inactivation of Pmel has only a mild effect on the coat color phenotype in four different genetic backgrounds, with the clearest effect in mice also carrying the brown/Tyrp1 mutation. This suggests that other previously described alleles in vertebrates with more striking effects on pigmentation are likely dominant-negative mutations. Despite the mild effect on visible pigmentation, inactivation of Pmel led to a substantial reduction in eumelanin content in hair, demonstrating that PMEL has a critical role in maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation.
Dengue vector control remains the primary method to prevent dengue infections, and environmental interventions represent a sustainable and safe approach. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of three environmental methods for dengue vector control: ( a ) container covers with and without insecticides, ( b ) waste management and clean-up campaigns, and ( c ) elimination of breeding sites by rendering potential mosquito breeding sites unusable or by eliminating them. Nineteen studies were eligible for the systematic review, and sixteen contributed data to the meta-analysis. Study quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste management without direct garbage collection and elimination of breeding places. Both the systematic review and meta-analysis showed a weak effect of the interventions on larval populations, with no obvious differences between the results of each individual method. For the meta-analysis, both container covers without insecticides and waste management with direct garbage collection achieved the strongest reductions for the Breteau index, whereas for the pupae per person index, container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places showed the strongest effects. Each of the investigated environmental methods showed some effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp. mosquitoes. However, there is a need for more comparable high-quality studies at an adequate standard to strengthen this evidence.
Small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by selectively stalling the ribosome have been identified as a new strategy for therapeutic development. One such compound, PF-06378503 ( PF8503 ), inhibits the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol in preclinical models. However, it is not known how PF8503 impacts the physiology of cells or ribosome quality control pathways. Here, we used a genome-wide CRISPRi screen to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of PF8503. The two most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness in the presence of PF8503 were the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and the helicase ASCC3, which bind to the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations of the compound. In contrast, translation quality control proteins Pelota and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. Genetic interaction experiments revealed that ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2, and functions downstream of HBS1L. These results identify new connections between ribosome quality control pathways and provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation, which will aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) promotes widespread destruction of cellular mRNAs to block host gene expression and evade immune detection. The viral protein SOX is responsible for this phenotype, but the mechanism of SOX-induced mRNA turnover has remained unknown. Here, we report that KSHV SOX stimulates cellular transcriptome turnover via a unique mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. Transcripts in SOX-expressing cells exhibit extended poly ( A ) polymerase II-generated poly ( A ) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. SOX-induced polyadenylation changes correlate with its RNA turnover function, and inhibition of poly ( A ) tail formation blocks SOX activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly ( A ) binding proteins are critical cellular cofactors for SOX function, the latter of which undergoes striking nuclear relocalization by SOX. SOX-induced mRNA turnover represents both a novel mechanism of host shutoff as well as a new model system to probe the regulation of poly ( A ) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.
Bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, induce the production of type III interferon ( IFNλ ) in the lung. IFNλ signaling is mediated by the IL-28R receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the respiratory tract and is essential for host defense against some viral pathogens. However, the role of IFNλ in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens is not well understood. In this study, we found that IFNλ is induced in the course of bacterial airway infection and results in downregulation of the microRNA miR-21, sustained expression of PDCD4, and increased proinflammatory cytokine production. Mice lacking the IFNλ receptor, IL-28R, or PDCD4 had significantly improved clearance of both airway pathogens and less pulmonary pathology associated with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines. These data suggest that during bacterial pneumonia, IFNλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR-21 regulation of PDCD4. Furthermore, we found that IFNλ and PDCD4 are conserved elements in the response to airway pathogens and that the selective expression of IL-28R may be important in the specific cytokine responses evoked by different pathogens.
Sleeping sickness, also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis ( HAT ), is a serious disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or T. brucei rhodesiense. In the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ), we conducted a retrospective study on 781 patients with advanced stage-2 HAT admitted between 1989 and 2012. The study aimed to investigate mortality trends and risk factors for death in these patients. We found that death rates varied depending on the treatment regimen: 17. 2% in the standard melarsoprol schedule, 12. 1% in the short schedule melarsoprol, 5. 4% in the first-line eflornithine, 9. 1% in the NECT treatment regimen, and 36% in the group treated with eflornithine due to advanced disease. After adjusting for treatment, we found that clinical dysfunction on admission, high protidorachy, presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ), and high cytorachy were significant predictors of death. A multivariable analysis within treatment groups retained clinical status on admission and high protidorachy as significant predictors of death. The study highlights the importance of clinical manifestations in assessing disease severity and the need for an objective test to assess HAT clinical severity.
Isolation profoundly affects social behavior in all animals, including humans, and has serious effects on health. Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model to study small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior. However, longer-term analysis of large groups of flies is hampered by the lack of effective and reliable tools. We describe a novel framework for the accurate tracking of multiple flies, their behavior classification and a method to study social network dynamics. We use this framework to study the effects of isolation on social network dynamics and perform the first genome-wide gene expression analysis to correlate transcriptomic and behavioral changes upon social isolation in male Drosophila. Our results show strong and specific effects of isolation on social network dynamics, metabolic gene expression and animal physiology. We observe that isolation significantly and swiftly enhances individual and local social network parameters depicting near-neighbor relationships. We explore the genome-wide molecular correlates of these behavioral changes and find that whereas behavior changes throughout the six days of isolation, gene expression alterations occur largely on day one. These changes occur mostly in metabolic genes, and we verify the metabolic changes by showing an increase of lipid content in isolated flies.
Diarrheal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in resource-limited settings. The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has developed evidence-based guidelines for the management of diarrheal disease, but adherence to these guidelines is often suboptimal. We evaluated the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the WHO diarrheal disease management guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation, in a clinical pilot study conducted in rural Bangladesh during the fall 2015 cholera season. The study consisted of a 6 week pre-intervention and 6 week intervention period with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. A total of 841 patients were enrolled, and the primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for prescriptions of intravenous ( IV ) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at the district and sub-district hospitals, and when IV fluids were prescribed, the volume better adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin increased, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased, and zinc adherence increased. These findings demonstrate that a smartphone-based tool can improve guideline adherence and support the hypothesis that technology-enabled decision-support tools can promote evidence-based practice in resource-limited settings.
Host–parasite interactions are complex, making it difficult to predict how they will respond to climate change. In particular, host and parasite traits such as survival and virulence may have distinct temperature dependencies that must be integrated into models of disease dynamics. To address this, we fitted a mechanistic model of within-host parasite population dynamics to experimental data from Daphnia magna and its natural microsporidian parasite, Ordospora colligata. We used the metabolic theory of ecology ( MTE ) to specify model parameters comprising host aging and mortality, as well as parasite growth, virulence, and equilibrium abundance. The MTE-based model effectively predicted host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection across temperature while using less than half the parameters compared to modeling temperatures discretely. Our results serve as a proof of concept that linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host–parasite framework can be used to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level.
GABAergic interneurons play an important role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells ( PCs ) by controlling the distribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition. Here, we propose a functional role for a network motif consisting of parvalbumin- ( PV ), somatostatin- ( SOM ) and vasoactive intestinal peptide ( VIP ) -expressing interneurons. PV interneurons mainly inhibit the perisomatic regions and basal dendrites of PCs, while SOM interneurons mainly target the apical dendrites of PCs and strongly inhibit other interneuron types. VIP interneurons mainly connect to the dendrite-targeting SOM neurons, thereby providing a disinhibitory circuit for the distal dendrite of PCs. We hypothesize that a subnetwork consisting of SOM and VIP neurons is optimized to efficiently control the PV/SOM-mediated redistribution of somatic and dendritic inhibition. Using a computational model, we show that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. Moreover, we demonstrate that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled. We have shown that the microcircuit comprising excitatory PCs and inhibitory PV, SOM and VIP neurons can act as an amplifier that translates weak input onto VIP cells into large changes in the somato-dendritic distribution of inhibition onto PCs.
Microbiome-wide association studies compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples to link specific microbes to host phenotypes. However, abundance differences reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype, but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. We found that microbial interactions can easily generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight. Using techniques from statistical physics, we developed a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Our method corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in the inflammatory bowel disease. We show that realistic microbial interactions produce a large number of spurious associations between particular members of the microbiome and phenotypes. These indirect associations can be removed by a simple procedure based on maximum entropy models from statistical physics.
Dengue and West Nile viruses are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia is a bacterium that can be used to block the replication and transmission of these viruses in mosquitoes. However, the effect of Wolbachia on pathogen replication and transmission is heavily influenced by the host-Wolbachia interaction and the model of infection. In this study, we compared the effect of Wolbachia in two infection models, stable transinfected and transiently infected mosquitoes, on the replication and transmission of two flaviviruses, DENV and WNV ( Kunjin strain ). Our results indicate that Wolbachia had similar blocking effects in both stable and transient models of infection. However, the magnitude of the blocking effect was significantly lower in mosquitoes transiently infected with Wolbachia. No evidence was found for any enhancement of either DENV or WNV ( Kunjin strain ) infection in Ae. aegypti infected with Wolbachia, supporting a role for Wolbachia as an effective and safe means for restricting transmission of these viruses.
Cilia are microtubule-based cellular organelles that mediate signal transduction and are composed of several distinct regions: the basal body, the transition zone ( TZ ), and the cilia shaft. In C. elegans, the cilia shafts of amphid channel and phasmid sensory cilia are subdivided into two regions defined by different microtubule ultrastructure: a proximal doublet-based region adjacent to the TZ, and a distal singlet-based region. We show that the InvC is conserved and distinct from the doublet region in C. elegans. The InvC and doublet region genes can be sorted into two modules—nphp-2+klp-11 and arl-13+unc-119—which are both antagonized by the hdac-6 deacetylase. The genes of this network modulate the sizes of the NPHP-2 InvC and ARL-13 doublet region. Glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting of InvC and doublet region components; rather, glutamylation is modulated by nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119. We conclude that the C. elegans InvC is distinct from the doublet region, and that components in these two regions interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, ciliary microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization.
Myelination and remyelination in the central nervous system ( CNS ) require profound morphological changes in oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells of the CNS. Here, we demonstrate that the basal polarity complex protein Scribble is required for CNS myelination and remyelination. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes where it is localised to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble expression in cultured oligodendroglia results in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. In transgenic mice, conditional elimination of Scribble expression in myelinating glia results in disrupted myelin initiation during development and following focal demyelination, as well as disrupted longitudinal extension of the myelin sheath. At later stages of myelination, Scribble acts to negatively regulate myelin thickness and suppresses the extracellular signal-related kinase ( ERK ) /mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAP ) kinase pathway. Furthermore, Scribble localises to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion.
Streptolysin S ( SLS ) is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor that plays a key role in the virulence of Group A Streptococcus ( GAS ), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impetigo, necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Although SLS was thought to be produced exclusively by GAS and related streptococci, evidence suggests that a number of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum and Staphylococcus aureus, produce related peptides. Notably, the L. monocytogenes cluster is found exclusively among a subset of lineage I strains, which are responsible for the majority of outbreaks of listeriosis. Expression of these genes results in the production of a haemolytic and cytotoxic factor, designated Listeriolysin S ( LLS ), which contributes to the virulence of the pathogen as assessed by murine- and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil–based studies. In silico analysis reveals that gene clusters potentially encoding SLS-like factors are also present in some of the most notorious Gram-positive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum.
Mycetoma is a chronic granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. The disease is characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains, which are surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. We investigated the expression of interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) and matrix metalloprotease-9 ( MMP-9 ) in the mycetoma granuloma and their correlation with the severity of the disease. We obtained surgical biopsies from 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma and evaluated IL-17 and MMP-9 expression in the mycetoma granuloma using immunohistochemistry. We found that IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was mainly expressed in Zones II and III. MMP-9 was more highly expressed in Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis biopsies compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. We also found that MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to the levels of IL-17 ( p = 0. 001 ). The only significant association between MMP-9 and the patients’ characteristics was the disease duration ( p<0. 001 ). There was an insignificant correlation between the IL-17 levels and the patients’ demographic characteristics.
Molecular recognition by intrinsically disordered proteins ( IDPs ) commonly involves specific localized contacts and target-induced disorder to order transitions. However, some IDPs remain disordered in the bound state, a phenomenon coined “fuzziness”, characterized by IDP polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity and a dynamic ensemble of disordered bound-state conformations. The transcriptional activation domain of the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family ( EAD ) is an IDP that exhibits many features of fuzziness, with multiple EAD aromatic side chains driving molecular recognition. We hypothesized that EAD-target binding involves polycation-π contacts between a disordered EAD and basic residues on the target. Herein we evaluated the polycation-π hypothesis via functional and theoretical interrogation of EAD variants. The experimental effects of a range of EAD sequence variations, including aromatic number, aromatic density and charge perturbations, all support the cation-π model. Moreover, the activity trends observed are well captured by a coarse-grained EAD chain model and a corresponding analytical model based on interaction between EAD aromatics and surface cations of a generic globular target. EAD-target binding, in the context of pathological Ewing's Sarcoma oncoproteins, is thus seen to be driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. Such a highly versatile mode of molecular recognition offers a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, codes for two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and Lon-2. Previous studies have shown that B. burgdorferi Lon-1 is upregulated transcriptionally by exposure to blood in vitro, while Lon-2 is not. We sought to clarify the functional roles of these two proteases in B. burgdorferi. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in the NH2-terminal substrate binding domains, which may reflect differences in substrate specificity. Recombinant Lon-1 manifested properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro but did not complement an E. coli Lon mutant, while Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. We conclude that B. burgdorferi Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, by virtue of its blood induction, may be important in host adaptation from the arthropod to a warm-blooded host.
Antibody-dependent phagocytosis ( ADP ) is a function of the immune system that is thought to play a role in controlling viral infections. However, the role of ADP in HIV-1 infection is unknown. In this study, we sought to directly measure the ability of antibodies to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions by phagocytic cells. We found that HIV-1 virions are poor targets for phagocytosis by phagocytic effector cells, including THP-1 and U937 cells, as well as freshly isolated primary monocytes from healthy individuals. In contrast, HIV-1 virions coated with gp41 or gp41-derived peptides were efficiently phagocytosed by gp41-specific monoclonal antibodies. We found that a minimum of a few hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, which is similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses that are readily phagocytosed. We also found that virion-decorated cells were targets for ADP or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. Our findings suggest that ADP of virions may not play a role in preventing HIV infection, likely due to the paucity of trimers and the consequent inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link FcyRs on phagocytes. However, ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells and cells on the verge of infection.
Hookworm infection is a highly endemic disease in many countries around the world, yet its global economic and health impact is not well known. We developed a computational simulation model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection in every country, WHO region, and globally in 2016 from the societal perspective. Using 2004 and 2010 disability weight estimates, we found that hookworm infection resulted in a total of 2, 126, 280 and 4, 087, 803 disability-adjusted life years ( DALYs ) worldwide, respectively. Excluding cognitive impairment outcomes, total productivity losses varied with the probability of anemia and calculation method used, ranging from $7. 5 billion to $138. 9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages and ranging from $2. 4 billion to $43. 9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy for annual wages. The economic and health burden of hookworm infection exceeded published estimates for a number of diseases that have received more attention than hookworm, such as rotavirus. Even though hookworm is classified as a neglected tropical disease, certain large countries that are transitioning to higher income countries, such as Brazil and China, still face considerable hookworm burden.
Developmental hypoxia is a major cause of chronic neurodevelopmental impairments in humans, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We have found that hypoxia disrupts pathfinding of forebrain neurons in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ), leading to errors in which commissural axons fail to cross the midline. The pathfinding defects result from activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor ( hif1 ) pathway and are mimicked by chemical inducers of the hif1 pathway or by expression of constitutively active hif1α. We identified ephrinB2a as a target of hif1 pathway activation and showed that knock-down of ephrinB2a rescued the guidance errors. We also found that the receptor ephA4a is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons. By targeting a constitutively active form of ephrinB2a to specific neurons, we found that ephrinB2a mediates the pathfinding errors via a reverse-signaling mechanism. Finally, we found that magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing upregulation of ephrinB2a. These results demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the CNS in response to hypoxia, and they support a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium.
Paracoccidioidomycosis ( PCM ) is an endemic fungal disease of pulmonary origin caused by the thermally dimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. The disease tends to run a chronic progressive course and disseminates to different sites including the lungs, oral mucous membranes, skin, adrenal glands, and reticuloendothelial system. In this study, we developed a mouse model of pulmonary PCM by intranasally inoculating male BALB/c mice with P. brasiliensis conidia. We used high resolution computed tomography ( HRCT ) and histopathology to evaluate and quantify pulmonary damage in the infected mice. HRCT was performed every four weeks to determine pulmonary lesions, quantify lung density, and reconstruct and quantify lung air structure. Histopathology and histomorphometry were also used to analyze lung lesions. Three different patterns of lesions were evidenced by HRCT and histopathology: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tumoral. The lesions were mainly located around the hilus and affected more frequently the left lung. HRCT showed that 80% of the Pb-infected mice had peri-bronchial consolidations associated with a significant increase in upper lung density at the 4th week post-challenge. Histopathology revealed that consolidation was equivalent to a confluent granulomatous reaction, while nodules corresponded to individual compact granulomas. Confluent granulomas formed pseudo-tumoral masses that obstructed large bronchi at the 16th week of infection. This study demonstrated that conventional HRCT is a useful tool for evaluation and quantification of pulmonary damage occurring in experimental mouse PCM.
Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ), a disease endemic in many parts of the world. In areas where VL is common, a large number of infected individuals remain asymptomatic and are able to mount a protective cellular immune response. Here, we propose the use of an interferon-gamma release assay ( IFN-γRA ) as a novel marker for latent L. donovani infection. We modified a commercial IFN-γRA kit ( QuantiFERON ) to evaluate five different leishmania-specific antigens: H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen ( CSA ), and soluble leishmania antigen ( SLA ). We evaluated the assay on blood samples from active VL patients, cured VL patients, non-endemic healthy controls, and healthy endemic controls. The assay based on SLA had a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 100%. Our findings suggest that a whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. Interestingly, active VL patients showed a positive IFN-γ response to stimulation with leishmania antigen, which is contradictory to the conventional finding of a non-proliferative antigen-specific response of peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is an enteric pathogen that can establish persistent infections in the gastrointestinal tract and cause relapsing enteritis and autoimmune disorders. In order to establish a persistent infection, the bacteria have to overcome the hostile environment of the intestinal epithelium and colonize the underlying gut-associated lymphatic tissues. Here, we show that the CNFY toxin, which enhances the translocation of the antiphagocytic Yop effectors, induces inflammatory responses that result in extensive tissue destruction, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance. However, suppression of CNFY function increases interferon-γ-mediated responses, comprising non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This process is accompanied by a preterm reprogramming of the pathogen's transcriptional response towards persistence, which gives the bacteria a fitness edge against host responses and facilitates establishment of a commensal-type lifestyle.
Magnaporthe oryzae is a fungal pathogen that causes rice blast, a devastating disease of rice. To successfully colonize and reproduce in host plants, pathogens need to overcome the innate defenses of the plant. We identified a novel pathogenicity gene in M. oryzae, named DES1, that regulates counter-defenses against host basal resistance. DES1 was identified by screening for pathogenicity-defective mutants in a T-DNA insertional mutant library. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DES1 encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, and its homologs are strictly conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes. Targeted gene deletion of DES1 had no apparent effect on developmental morphogenesis, including vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressorium formation, and appressorium-mediated penetration. However, the Δdes1 mutant was hypersensitive to exogenous oxidative stress and the activity and transcription level of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases, were severely decreased in the mutant. In addition, ferrous ion leakage was observed in the Δdes1 mutant. In the interaction with a susceptible rice cultivar, rice cells inoculated with the Δdes1 mutant exhibited strong defense responses accompanied by brown granules in primary infected cells, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), the generation of autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction in neighboring tissues. The Δdes1 mutant displayed a significant reduction in infectious hyphal extension, which caused a decrease in pathogenicity.
Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in Ghana, and mapping its distribution is essential to determine where control programs should operate. However, because it is impractical to assess infection prevalence in every potentially endemic community, model-based geostatistics ( MBG ) is increasingly being used to predict prevalence and determine intervention strategies. To assess the accuracy of MBG predictions for Schistosoma haematobium infection in Ghana, school surveys were evaluated at 79 sites to yield empiric prevalence values that could be compared with values derived from recently published MBG predictions. Based on these findings, schools were categorized according to WHO guidelines so that practical implications of any differences could be determined. Using the mean predicted values alone, 21 of the 25 empirically determined ‘high-risk’ schools requiring yearly praziquantel treatment would have been undertreated, and almost 20% of the remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically-determined absence of infection. This translates into 28% of the children in the 79 schools being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment in the absence of any demonstrated need.
Sperm guidance in the Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) reproductive tract is a complex process that is not well understood. We have shown that C. elegans oocytes synthesize a heterogeneous mixture of F-series prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) precursors provided in yolk lipoprotein complexes. These prostaglandins function collectively and largely redundantly to promote sperm guidance. We have partially delineated the F-series prostaglandin metabolism pathways in C. elegans using genetics and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Our results show that omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs, including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, are converted into more than 10 structurally related F-series prostaglandins. Disruption of omega-3 PUFA synthesis triggers compensatory up-regulation of prostaglandins derived from omega-6 PUFAs. We have also identified a conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme that functions to inhibit prostaglandin metabolism, possibly by diverting their precursors into an alternative pathway. Our results support the model that multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins function together to promote sperm motility important for fertilization.
Immunogenicity of biotherapeutics is a major barrier to their development and clinical application. To address this issue, we have developed algorithms that simultaneously optimize proteins for reduced T cell epitope content and high-level function. In silico analysis of this dual objective design space reveals that there is no single global optimum with respect to protein deimmunization, but rather a spectrum of designs that exhibit tradeoffs between immunogenic potential and molecular function. The leading edge of this design space is the Pareto frontier, i. e. the undominated variants for which no other single design exhibits better performance in both criteria. Here, we have designed, constructed, and experimentally evaluated the Pareto frontier of a therapeutic enzyme. Our results represent the first systematic and rigorous assessment of the functional penalty that must be paid for pursuing progressively more deimmunized biotherapeutic candidates. We have produced 18 of these Pareto optimal variants and subjected them to a rigorous experimental analysis of key performance parameters. The predictions underlying the design process correlated well with experimental analyses of protein function, and we observed that incremental deletion of T cell epitopes leads to a relative escalation in concomitant loss of function.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that elevated temperature increases the frequency of meiotic crossovers ( COs ) via the Type I recombination pathway, which is sensitive to interference. COs are essential for proper chromosome segregation during meiosis, and their frequency and distribution are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, we demonstrate that elevated temperature induces hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis and that the extra COs are derived from the Type I pathway. We also show that heat-induced COs are not the result of an increase in DNA double-strand breaks and that the hyper-recombinant phenotype is likely specific to thermal stress rather than a more generalized stress response. Our findings provide initial mechanistic insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may offer practical applications for plant breeding.
Biomedical research is becoming increasingly challenging to navigate due to the rapid growth of new results in the scientific literature, particularly in molecular biomedicine. To address this challenge, we describe a novel computational approach that combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate the analysis of experimental data. This approach, called the Hanalyzer, extracts information from external resources, tracks knowledge provenance, and combines all sources into a knowledge network that represents the integration of all sorts of relationships between a pair of genes. The knowledge network is then combined with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualized in a tool that facilitates the knowledge-based analysis of that data. We demonstrate the use of the Hanalyzer on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development. The tool was critical in the creation of hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development; each of these hypotheses was validated by further experimental work. We also describe a Cytoscape plugin called CommonAttributes that allows the user to trace the provenance of links in the knowledge network and directly access the underlying data sources and publications.
Helminth parasites, such as Fasciola hepatica, secrete extracellular vesicles ( EVs ) that can be internalised by host immune cells to modulate host immunity. While the molecular cargo of EVs has been characterised in many parasites, little is known about the surface-exposed molecules that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with the host cell surface to initiate vesicle docking and subsequent internalisation. Using a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins displayed on the outer membrane surface of two EV sub-populations ( termed 15k and 120k EVs ) released by adult F. hepatica, we describe 380 surface proteins including virulence factors, membrane transport proteins and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis show that the 120k EVs have an endosomal origin and may be released from the parasite via the protonephridial ( excretory ) system whilst the larger 15k EVs are released from the gastrodermal epithelial cells that line the fluke gut.
MicroRNAs ( miRNAs ) are small non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. In plants, miRNAs are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs ( pri-miRNAs ) by RNA polymerase II, then cleaved into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 ( DCL1 ). We identified a cycling DOF transcription factor, CDF2, which interacts with DCL1 and regulates the accumulation of a population of miRNAs. CDF2 binds directly to the promoters of some miRNAs and works as a transcription activator or repressor for these miRNA genes. In addition, CDF2 binds preferentially to the pri-miRNAs regulated by itself and affects DCL1-mediated processing of these pri-miRNAs. We found that CDF2 regulates a group of pri-miRNAs at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels to maintain proper levels of their mature miRNAs. This regulation is important for plant development, as CDF2 works in the same pathway as miR156 or miR172 to control flowering. We also found that CDF2 regulates the expressions of components involved in miRNA biogenesis, which may affect miRNA biogenesis through regulating the levels of these components.
Folliculogenesis, the process by which follicles develop in the ovary to produce ova, is a highly regulated process that requires bidirectional communication between the oocyte and granulosa cells. This communication is essential for the proliferation of granulosa cells and the transition from primary to secondary follicles, a key phase of folliculogenesis. Here, we report that oocyte geranylgeranyl diphosphate ( GGPP ), a metabolic intermediate involved in protein geranylgeranylation, is required for the establishment of oocyte-granulosa cell communication. GGPP levels increase in oocytes during early follicular development and are synthesized from farnesyl diphosphate ( FPP ) by geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase ( Ggpps ). Depletion of GGPP in oocytes impairs the proliferation of granulosa cells, the transition from primary to secondary follicles, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GGPP depletion inhibits Rho GTPase geranylgeranylation and its GTPase activity, which is responsible for the accumulation of cell junction proteins in the oocyte cytoplasm and the failure to maintain physical connection between oocyte and granulosa cells. GGPP depletion also blocks Rab27a geranylgeranylation, which might account for the impaired secretion of oocyte materials such as Gdf9. Moreover, GGPP administration restores the defects in oocyte-granulosa cell contact, granulosa cell proliferation, and primary-secondary follicle transition in Ggpps depletion mice.
RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of messenger RNA using a DNA template. Despite extensive biochemical and biophysical studies, it has been unclear whether the “secondary channel” is the only route for nucleoside triphosphate ( NTP ) to reach the active site of the enzyme or if the “main channel” could be an alternative. We have built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble based on multiple sources of existing structural data and used Molecular Dynamics ( MD ) simulations together with structural analysis to shed light on NTP entry pathways. We found that although both channels have enough space to allow NTP loading, the percentage of MD conformations containing enough space for NTP loading through the secondary channel is twice higher than that of the main channel. Further energetic study based on MD simulations with NTP loaded in the channels has revealed that the diffusion of the NTP through the main channel is greatly disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between the NTP and the highly negatively charged backbones of nucleotides in the non-template DNA strand. Taken together, our results suggest that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription.
Dengue is a major public health problem in Thailand and Cambodia, where children below 15 years of age are especially affected. Although dengue is a reportable disease in both countries, the degree to which reported incidence underrecognizes the true disease burden is unknown. We estimated the magnitude of dengue underrecognition and established more accurate disease burden estimates for these countries by utilizing dengue incidence calculated from laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases in prospective cohort studies. Cohort studies were conducted among children aged <15 years by members of a dengue field site consortium over at least 2 dengue seasons. Age-group specific multiplication factors ( MFs ) were computed by comparing data from three cohort studies to national surveillance data in the same province and year. In Thailand, 14, 627 person-years of prospective cohort data were obtained in two provinces and 14, 493 person-years from one province in Cambodia. The average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed dengue was 23/1, 000 and 25/1, 000 in Thailand, and 41/1, 000 in Cambodia. Calculated MFs in these provinces varied by age-group and year ( range 0. 4–29 ). Average age-group specific MFs were then applied to country-level reporting data and indicated that in Thailand a median 229, 886 ( range 210, 612–331, 236 ) dengue cases occurred annually during 2003–2007 and a median 111, 178 ( range 80, 452–357, 135 ) cases occurred in Cambodia in children <15 years of age.
Natural killer ( NK ) cells have been shown to directly contribute to the control of viral replication, but their role in orchestrating global antiviral defense is not well understood. To address this question, we examined the consequences of specific defects in the ability of NK cells to control mouse cytomegalovirus ( MCMV ) on antiviral CD8 T cell responses. By using congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses, we demonstrated that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection in vivo. We identified the underlying mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit IFN-α/β production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through the early control of cytomegalovirus, which dramatically reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells ( pDCs ) for cytokine production, preserves the conventional dendritic cell ( cDC ) compartment, and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation in the face of NK cell control of viral replication. Our data demonstrate that the ability of NK cells to respond very early to cytomegalovirus infection critically contributes to balance the intensity of other innate immune responses, which dampens early immunopathology and promotes optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Thus, the extent to which NK cell responses benefit the host goes beyond their direct antiviral effects and extends to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and to the promotion of adaptive immunity.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, we have identified four major rRNA gene variants that are differentially expressed in plants with a disrupted nucleolin-like protein gene ( Atnuc-L1 ). The most highly represented rRNA gene variant, which is normally inactive in wild-type plants, is reactivated in Atnuc-L1 mutants. We show that the accumulation of pre–rRNAs in Atnuc-L1 mutant plants originates from RNA Pol I transcription and is processed accurately. Moreover, we demonstrate that disruption of the AtNUC-L1 gene induces loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone epigenetic marks at rRNA genes. These data reveal a novel mechanism for rRNA gene transcriptional regulation in which the nucleolin protein plays a major role in controlling active and repressed rRNA gene variants in Arabidopsis.
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) gene expression is regulated in part by histone deacetylation, a process mediated by the histone deacetylase 1 ( HDAC1 ) protein. In this study, we identified candidate HDAC1-interacting proteins in the context of HCMV infection, including the viral proteins pUL38 and pUL29/28. We confirmed the interaction of pUL38 and pUL29/28 with HDAC1 by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. HDAC1 is a component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase protein complex ( NuRD ), and we found that pUL38 and pUL29/28 associated with the MTA2 component of NuRD. Knockdown of the NuRD constituents RBBP4 and CHD4 inhibited HCMV immediate-early RNA and viral DNA accumulation, suggesting that multiple components of the NuRD complex are needed for efficient HCMV replication. We also found that the growth of pUL29/28- or pUL38-deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating infected cells with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, and that transient expression of pUL29/28 enhanced activity of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter assay. Importantly, induction of the major immediate-early reporter activity by pUL29/28 required functional NuRD components. We propose that pUL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) is the major cause of pneumonia among infants. Here we elucidated the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection and traced its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. We used whole genome-fragment phage display libraries ( GFPDL ) expressing linear and conformational epitopes in the RSV fusion protein ( F ) and attachment protein ( G ) to determine the epitope repertoires of polyclonal serum antibodies from infants prior to and following RSV infection. We observed modest changes in the anti-F epitope repertoires post-RSV infection, while anti-G epitope repertoires revealed a 100-fold increase in the number of bound phages following infection. The G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-terminus of the G ectodomain, along with increased reactivity to the central conserved domain ( CCD ). We also observed a steady increase in RSV-F epitope repertoires from young children to adults. Importantly, several novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in the F-p27. In all age groups, antibody binding to pre-fusion F was 2–3 folds higher than to post-fusion form. For RSV-G, antibody responses were high following early RSV infection in children, but declined significantly in adults. This study identified unlinked evolution of anti-F and anti G responses and supportive evidence for immune pressure driven evolution of RSV-G.
Emodepside, a veterinary anthelmintic, has been reported to have macrofilaricidal effects against adult filarial nematodes. Here, we explore the mode of action of emodepside using adult Brugia malayi, one of the species that causes lymphatic filariasis. Our results show that emodepside potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels and that the male is more sensitive than the female. We found that emodepside targets SLO-1 K channels and that the slo-1f isoform, found in muscles of males, is more sensitive to emodepside than the slo-1a isoform found in muscles of females. Selective RNAi of the slo-1a isoform in female worms increased emodepside potency. In silico modeling identified an emodepside binding pocket in the same RCK1 region of different species of filaria that is affected by these splice variations. Our observations show that emodepside has potent macrofilaricidal effects and alternative splicing in the RCK1 binding pocket affects potency. Therefore, the evaluation of potential sex-dependent effects of an anthelmintic compound is of importance to prevent any under-dosing of one or the other gender of nematodes once given to patients.
The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( LF ) relies on rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ) to determine where annual mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. These tests detect a Wuchereria bancrofti glycoprotein in the blood of infected persons via a carbohydrate moiety recognized by the monoclonal antibodies AD12 and DH6. 5. Loiasis cross-reactivity with LF RDTs has recently been recognized as a serious obstacle to LF elimination in loiasis-endemic areas. To better understand the nature of this cross-reactivity, we used the DH6. 5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa loa antigens from the sera of individuals with a positive RDT due to loiasis. Immunoblot analysis revealed many circulating AD12/DH6. 5-reactive antigens, and proteomic analysis identified multiple L. loa proteins in LF RDT-positive loiasis sera. These included both secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting that they may be released by dying L. loa adult worms and/or microfilariae. Unlike the single high molecular weight W. bancrofti circulating filarial antigen that is reliably present in the blood of persons with bancroftian filariasis, reactive L. loa antigens appeared to be only transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with loiasis. These key differences between the circulating antigens of W. bancrofti and L. loa can be used to differentiate positive results generated by both species and may lead to improved diagnostic tests for LF and loiasis.
Primary cilia are sensory and developmental signalling organelles extending from the surface of most eukaryotic cells. Defects in these organelles cause ciliopathies, such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ), affecting multiple physiological and developmental processes. Cilia formation, maintenance and function depend on intraflagellar transport ( IFT ), which is driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dynein motors and regulated by the Bardet-Biedl syndrome ( BBS ) cargo-adaptor protein complex, or BBSome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, we employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs within a short timespan during late embryogenesis. Using whole-organism RNA-Seq libraries, we discovered a signature expression profile highly enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM-161, CCDC-104, and RPI-1. From a list of 185 candidate ciliary genes, we uncovered orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CCDC149, and RAB28 as conserved cilium-associated components. Further analyses of C. elegans RAB-28, recently associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, reveal that this small GTPase is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons where it dynamically associates with IFT trains.
The brain represents the outside world by relying on neural responses to external stimuli. However, it is unclear how the brain can “decode” these responses without independent access to the stimuli. We investigate what can be learned about a space of stimuli using only the action potentials ( spikes ) of cells with stereotyped—but unknown—receptive fields. Using hippocampal place cells as a model system, we show that one can ( 1 ) extract global features of the environment and ( 2 ) construct an accurate representation of space, up to an overall scale factor, that can be used to track the animal's position. Unlike previous approaches to reconstructing position from place cell activity, this information is derived without knowing place fields or any other functions relating neural responses to position. We find that simply knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying stimulus space; this may enable the brain to construct its own internal representations. We find that the simple knowledge of which groups of hippocampal place cells fire together is enough to ( 1 ) extract global topological features of the environment, and ( 2 ) reconstruct an accurate geometric representation of physical space within which the animal's position can be faithfully tracked. We have shown that, in the case of hippocampal place cell activity, global topological features of a two-dimensional environment as well as an accurate geometric reconstruction of physical space—including the animal's position within it—can be inferred from spikes alone.
The NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β play a critical role in the pathogenesis of viral fulminant hepatitis ( FH ), a severe disease with high mortality resulting from excessive inflammation in the infected liver. We show that mice infected with murine hepatitis virus strain-3 ( MHV-3 ), a model for viral FH, manifest with severe disease and high mortality in association with a significant elevation in IL-1β expression in the serum and liver. In contrast, mice deficient in the IL-1β receptor ( IL-1R1-/- ) or treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist ( IL-1Ra ) show reductions in virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. Furthermore, IL-1R1 deficiency appears to debilitate virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 ( FGL2 ) production in macrophages and CD45+Gr-1high neutrophil infiltration in the liver. We also show that mice deficient in p47phox, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( NADPH ) oxidase subunit that controls acute reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production, present with reductions in NLRP3 inflammasome activation and subsequent IL-1β secretion during viral infection. Moreover, mice deficient in NLRP3 and Caspase-1, two essential components of the inflammasome complex, also show reduced IL-1β induction and ameliorated hepatitis.
Severe anemia and iron deficiency are important causes of morbidity in pre-school children in the tropics, and hookworm infections are considered a key factor. However, the contribution of the two main hookworm species, Ancylostoma duodenale ( A. duodenale ) and Necator americanus ( N. americanus ), to the disease burden is rarely assessed due to limitations of current diagnostic methods. In this study, we used multiplex real-time PCR to determine the prevalence of A. duodenale and N. americanus, as well as their contribution to severe anemia and bone marrow iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi. We found that 34. 1% of the severely anemic cases and 27. 0% of the non-severely anemic controls were infected with hookworms. The prevalence of A. duodenale and N. americanus was 26. 1% and 4. 9%, respectively. We also found that moderate and high load A. duodenale infections were positively associated with severe anemia ( adjusted odds ratio: 2. 49 ( 95%CI 1. 16–5. 33 ) and 9. 04 ( 95%CI 2. 52–32. 47 ), respectively ). Furthermore, iron deficiency was positively associated with the intensity of A. duodenale infection ( adjusted odds ratio: 3. 63 ( 95%CI 1. 18–11. 20 ) ; 16. 98 ( 95%CI 3. 88–74. 35 ) and 44. 91 ( 95%CI 5. 23–385. 77 ) for low, moderate and high load, respectively ).
In Caenorhabditis elegans, meiotic double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) can be repaired via homologous recombination ( HR ) or non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ). HR is required for the formation of interhomolog crossovers ( COs ), which are necessary for meiotic chromosome segregation. Here, we identify COM-1, the homolog of CtIP/Sae2/Ctp1, as a crucial regulator of DSB repair pathway choice during C. elegans gametogenesis. COM-1 is not required for the initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but instead promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting the NHEJ complex Ku. In the absence of COM-1, germ cells repair meiotic DSBs via NHEJ, resulting in a lack of COs, extensive chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality. In contrast, animals defective for both COM-1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. COM-1 acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at the early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase and thereby safeguards timely CO formation. Our results uncover the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identify a critical role for COM-1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells.
Melioidosis is a disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei that results in high mortality rates in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. To better understand the immune response to B. pseudomallei, a caprine melioidosis model of aerosol infection was developed. In this model, B. pseudomallei was delivered as an intratracheal aerosol to outbred goats. The humoral immune response was analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and the antigenic proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. The results showed a greater humoral response with IgG antibodies compared to IgM antibodies throughout the course of the infection. Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins already reactive for IgG and IgM in most of the goats. After infection, the number of IgG reactive proteins increased as the disease progressed. Early stage infection showed immune reaction to chaperone proteins GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK. These proteins were detected in all serum samples after infection, with GroEL immunogenically dominant. The heat shock protein GroEL1 elicited the strongest goat antibody immune response compared to other antigens.
Cyclin B1–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( Cdk1 ) activation is the key event that initiates mitotic entry, triggered by a positive feedback loop at the end of G2. Cyclin B1–Cdk1 is inactivated by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome–dependent destruction of cyclin B1 in metaphase, allowing mitotic exit and cell division. We used a novel approach to determine the temporal development of cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity in single cells. By quantifying both dephosphorylation of Cdk1 and phosphorylation of the Cdk1 target anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome 3, we found that cyclin B1–Cdk1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation. Importantly, we discovered that cytoplasmic cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus in prophase. We propose that gradually increasing cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression. In line with the observed kinetics, cyclin B1–Cdk1 levels required to enter mitosis are lower than the amount of cyclin B1–Cdk1 needed for mitotic progression. We propose that distinct thresholds for cyclin B1–Cdk1 activity exist that control successive mitotic events.
HIV-1 vaccines have failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies ( Nabs ) capable of protecting against diverse HIV-1 subtypes. HIV-1 superinfection ( SI ), defined as sequential infections from different source partners, has been shown to lead to a broader and more potent Nab response compared to single infection. However, it is unclear whether SI impacts epitope specificity and if the epitopes targeted after SI differ from those targeted after single infection. Here, we examined the post-SI Nab responses from 21 Kenyan women who were collectively exposed to subtypes A, C, and D and superinfected after a median time of ~1. 07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples were collected at a median time point ~2. 72 years post-SI. We focused on 4 main epitopes on the HIV-1 Envelope, including the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. Using standard epitope mapping techniques, we found that SI did not induce a dominant Nab response to any one of these epitopes in the 21 women. Computational sera delineation analyses also suggested that 20 of the 21 superinfected women’s Nab responses could not be ascribed a single specificity with high confidence. These data are consistent with a model in which SI with diverse subtypes promotes the development of a broad polyclonal Nab response, and thus would provide support for vaccine designs using multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of Nabs.
Congenital human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) infection is the leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide. HCMV infection has been shown to dysregulate the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells ( NPCs ). As an important downstream effector of Notch signaling, the transcriptional regulator Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 ( Hes1 ) is essential for governing NPC fate and fetal brain development. In the present study, we report that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected NPCs. The HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein ( IE1 ) is involved in Hes1 degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes1 ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes1. A C-terminal acidic region in IE1, spanning amino acids 451 to 475, is required for IE1/Hes1 physical interaction and IE1-mediated Hes1 ubiquitination, but is dispensable for IE1/Sp100A interaction and ubiquitination. Our study suggests a novel mechanism linking downregulation of Hes1 protein to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by HCMV infection. Our findings also complement the current knowledge of herpesviruses by identifying IE1 as the first potential HCMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.
Divergence of transcription factor ( TF ) binding in Drosophila embryos has been studied in four species: Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila yakuba, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and Drosophila virilis. Genome-wide binding of four TFs involved in early anterior-posterior patterning was measured by ChIP-seq, while gene expression was measured by mRNA-seq. We found that mRNA levels are much better conserved than individual TF binding events, and that changes in a gene's expression are poorly explained by changes in adjacent TF binding. However, highly bound sites, sites in regions bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding. This suggests that a considerable amount of TF binding is weakly or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection. We found that the genomic binding of A-P factors has changed extensively along the Drosophila tree with little effect on downstream gene expression. We identified two potential genetic sources of binding divergence: alterations of BCD, HB, GT, and KR-specific motifs drive a portion of the binding divergence. We also found that mRNA levels are highly correlated between species, with the correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance. Overall, we conclude that TF binding has diverged considerably within the Drosophila genus.
Lymphatic filariasis is a major public health problem in India, and the National Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis ( NPELF ) aims to eliminate the disease by 2015. Monitoring and evaluation of the programme requires impact assessments in at least one sentinel and one spot-check site in each implementation unit ( IU ). Transmission assessment surveys ( TAS ) that assess antigenaemia ( Ag ) in children in IUs that have completed at least five rounds of mass drug administration ( MDA ) each with >65% coverage and with microfilaria ( Mf ) levels <1% in the monitored sites form the basis for stopping the MDA. However, this multi-step process is likely to miss sites with transmission potential ( ‘hotspots’ ) and its statistical assumptions for sampling and threshold levels for decision-making have not been validated. We carried out a large-scale epidemiological study in two primary health centres in Thanjavur district, India, endemic for bancroftian filariasis that had undergone eight rounds of MDA. The prevalence and intensity of Mf ( per 60 µl blood ) were 0. 2% and 0. 004 respectively in the survey that covered >70% of 50, 363 population. The corresponding values for Ag were 2. 3% and 17. 3 Ag-units respectively. We identified 7 “residual” ( Mf-prevalence ≥1%, irrespective of Ag-status in children ) and 17 “transmission” ( at least one Ag-positive child born during the MDA period ) hotspots, and an Ag-prevalence of ∼1% in children ( equivalent to 0. 4% community Mf-prevalence ) as a possible threshold value for stopping MDA.
Dengue fever is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions, and controlling its vector, the Aedes aegypti mosquito, is essential for disease prevention. One of the most commonly used methods for dengue vector control is the application of temephos, an organophosphate larvicide, to water storage containers. A systematic literature review was conducted to assess the community-effectiveness of temephos in controlling both vectors and dengue transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other interventions. The review included 27 studies, of which 11 were single intervention studies and 16 were combined intervention studies. The results showed that temephos was effective in reducing entomological indices when used as a single intervention, but this effect was not sustained when used in combination with other chemical vector control methods. The effectiveness of temephos was found to be dependent on several factors, including the quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental factors such as organic debris, temperature, and exposure to sunlight. The review also identified several limitations of temephos use, including the need for reapplication, reluctance to apply temephos to drinking water, and operational aspects such as cost, supplies, time, and labour.
The Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and the replication fork-associated factor Csm3 play important roles in the establishment of cohesion at the pericentromere, the region surrounding the centromere where sister chromatids are held together by the cohesin complex. We show that the Ctf19 complex directs the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere, while Csm3 is essential for ensuring the functionality of cohesin in holding sister centromeres together. The Ctf19 complex is required for the enhancement of cohesin in the pericentromere, and two of its peripheral proteins, Iml3 and Chl4, direct increased cohesin association with the pericentromeric region during both mitosis and meiosis. In the absence of Iml3 and Chl4, cohesin binding at the pericentromere is reduced and this has important implications for sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation. Csm3 is crucial in ensuring the integrity of the replisome and its association with cohesion establishment factors as it traverses the protein-DNA barrier that surrounds the centromere. The resultant enhanced cohesion in the vicinity of the centromere safeguards the fidelity of chromosome segregation. We conclude that the Ctf19 complex plays similar roles in pericentromeric cohesion establishment during mitosis and meiosis, and that the Ctf19 complex and Csm3 are highly conserved.
Dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DF/DHF ) is a major public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions, with an estimated 100 million infections occurring annually. To better understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of dengue pathogenesis, we conducted a systems level characterization of serum metabolome and lipidome in adult patients with primary dengue infection at early febrile, defervescence, and convalescent stages. Using liquid chromatography- and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, we identified 60 differential metabolites in a relatively large sample size of 44 patients and 50 healthy controls. The main metabolite classes were free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Major perturbed metabolic pathways included fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and the steroid hormone pathway. These changes suggest a multifactorial nature of human host responses to dengue infection. Analysis of phospholipids and sphingolipids revealed association with lymphocytes and platelets numbers, and these metabolites were significantly perturbed during the early stages and normalized to control levels at the convalescent stage, suggesting their potential utility as prognostic markers. Our findings provide a first detailed description of the metabolome changes in patients with acute dengue infection and offer a global molecular view that leads to the overall homeostatic physiological outcome of DF.
Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) have been the focus of increasing research efforts in recent decades, yet significant gaps remain in diagnostic and treatment tools. To better understand the global research landscape, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of NTD research with a focus on German contributions. We searched the SCOPUS database for articles published between 2002 and 2012 with German author affiliations, and extracted metadata to build co-authorship research networks. We identified 1, 187 publications with at least one German author affiliation out of 26, 833 worldwide publications on 11 NTDs, and processed 972 publications for the five most published-about diseases. We extracted 4, 007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil. We identified strong performers on an individual level by using classic parameters ( number of publications, h-index ) and social network analysis parameters ( betweenness centrality ). The research network characteristics varied strongly between diseases. We found that the share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research, underlining the need to identify barriers and expand Germany’s research activities towards NTDs.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) have been targeted in Haiti since 2000 with a strong mass drug administration (MDA) program led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population and its international partners. By 2012, Haiti’s neglected tropical disease (NTD) program had reached full national scale and was able to stop treatment for LF throughout almost all of the country. The success of the program can be attributed to several key programmatic elements, including strong community awareness through a multi-channel communication and education campaign facilitated by voluntary drug distributors, community trust of the drug distributors, directly observed treatment, easy access to treatment through numerous distribution posts and a strong drug supply chain, and quality data collection to guide MDA strategies. As a result, Haiti achieved 100% geographical coverage in 2012, with almost all districts consistently achieving well above the epidemiological coverage targets of 65% for LF and 75% for STH. The program also resulted in a significant reduction in the burden of infection, with 45 communes reaching the target threshold for stopping treatment for LF. By taking advantage of sustained international financial and technical support, Haiti’s MDA campaign resulted in steady progress toward LF elimination and the development of a strong foundation for ongoing STH control.
Alphaproteobacteria, such as Sinorhizobium meliloti, require tight regulation of the cell cycle to coordinate genome replication, segregation, and cell division. During symbiosis with legume hosts, S. meliloti undergoes cellular differentiation, resulting in massive genome amplification, cell branching and/or elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. The master regulator CtrA has been shown to play a key role in cell cycle regulation in Caulobacter crescentus, and recent research suggests that CtrA may also be important in S. meliloti. Here, we investigated the regulation and function of CtrA in S. meliloti. We found that depletion of CtrA causes cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to that observed in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. We also showed that the cell cycle regulated proteolytic degradation of CtrA is essential in S. meliloti, suggesting a possible mechanism of CtrA depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using ChIP-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis, we found that S. meliloti CtrA regulates similar processes as C. crescentus CtrA, but does so through different target genes. For example, S. meliloti CtrA negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system, whereas C. crescentus CtrA regulates the expression of the Fts complex to control the timing of cell division.
Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. The ability of F. tularensis to multiply and survive in macrophages is critical for its virulence. We identified a mutant strain of the F. tularensis live vaccine strain ( LVS ) that was unable to multiply intracellularly and was strongly attenuated for virulence in mice. This mutant had a transposon insertion in a gene encoding a putative γ-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ), which we designated ggt. We demonstrated that the GGT activity of F. tularensis allows the bacterium to utilize glutathione ( GSH ) and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as sources of cysteine to ensure intracellular growth. GSH is the most abundant source of cysteine in the host cytosol, and the ability of F. tularensis to utilize it as a source of cysteine constitutes a paradigm of bacteria–host adaptation. We showed that the ggt mutant was unable to utilize GSH and γ-glutamyl-cysteine dipeptide as sources of cysteine, and that only the addition of free cysteine could compensate for its enzymatic deficiency. We also demonstrated that the F. tularensis GGT can functionally complement an E. coli GGT-deficient strain, and that it can cleave the γ-glutamyl-cysteine bond of the dipeptide γ-Glu-Leu.
Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major are protozoan parasites that alternate between flagellated promastigotes in insect vectors and amastigotes enclosed in phagolysosome-like Parasitophorous Vacuoles ( PVs ) of infected mammalian host cells. To determine if PVs of these Leishmania species can fuse with each other, mouse macrophages in culture were infected with non-fluorescent L. amazonensis amastigotes and then superinfected with fluorescent L. major amastigotes or promastigotes. Live imaging of infected cells revealed that PVs containing L. amazonensis amastigotes did not fuse with PVs containing L. major amastigotes. However, PVs containing L. major promastigotes did fuse with pre-established L. amazonensis PVs. In these chimeric vacuoles, L. major promastigotes remained motile and multiplied, but did not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, within their own PVs, L. major promastigotes differentiated into proliferating amastigotes. The results indicate that PVs, presumably customized by L. major amastigotes or promastigotes, differ in their ability to fuse with L. amazonensis PVs. Additionally, a species-specific PV was required for L. major destruction or differentiation.
Eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research. Here, we show that native, membrane-expressed HIV-1 Env trimers can elicit potent neutralizing antibodies ( nAbs ) that bind to quaternary epitopes involving glycan-deficient patches proximal to the CD4 binding site. Two of eight rabbits immunized with virus-like particles ( VLPs ) expressing trimers and one of twenty rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer, followed by a protein boost, developed unusually potent nAb titers. All three sera neutralized via quaternary epitopes and exploited natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of JR-FL gp120. Specifically, trimer VLP sera took advantage of the unusual absence of a glycan at residue 197, while the neutralizing DNA trimer serum targeted the absence of a glycan at residue 230, also proximal to the CD4 binding site. Our data show that strain-specific holes in the glycan fence can allow the development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes and that cross-neutralization can occur in the absence of protecting glycan.
Buruli ulcer ( BU ) is a chronic skin and subcutaneous tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. While antibiotic treatment with a combination of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin has improved treatment outcomes and reduced recurrence rates, wound healing is often delayed in a proportion of patients. To better understand the wound healing process in BU patients, we have performed immunohistochemical investigations on tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions collected before, during and after antibiotic treatment. We have identified a set of markers that allow monitoring wound healing in BU lesions by immunohistochemistry. These markers include α-smooth muscle actin ( αSMA ) positive myofibroblasts, which produce extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins such as pro-collagen 1 and tenascin, and are found in fibronectin rich areas. We have also identified ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation, a marker for translation initiation, in many cells, including myofibroblasts, after antibiotic treatment. In addition, we have observed dermal tissue remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 ( CK16 ) expression in the epidermis in healing wounds. We have also found that the mTor pathway is activated in myofibroblasts emerging in antibiotic treated BU lesions, which may help to discriminate between healing and non-healing wounds in BU.
Mitochondrial trafficking in adult mammalian peripheral axons has been shown to increase in response to impulse conduction in vivo. Using confocal imaging of saphenous nerves in anaesthetised mice, we found that electrical stimulation of myelinated and unmyelinated axons increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in comparison to silent axons. Higher frequency conduction ( 50 Hz ) further increased anterograde, but not retrograde, mitochondrial traffic by rapidly increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and gradually increasing their velocity. Similarly, topical application of capsaicin to skin innervated by the saphenous nerve increased mitochondrial traffic in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. We also found that stationary mitochondria in axons conducting at higher frequency became shorter, suggesting that they may supply additional mitochondria to the trafficking population through enhanced fission. Mitochondria recruited to the mobile population did not accumulate near Nodes of Ranvier, but continued to travel anterogradely. This pattern of mitochondrial redistribution suggests that the peripheral terminals of sensory axons represent sites of particularly high metabolic demand during physiological high frequency conduction.
Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis ( SCT ) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by loss of function mutations in Filamin B ( FLNB ) and characterized by progressive vertebral fusions. FLNB acts as a signaling scaffold by linking the actin cytoskeleton to signal transduction systems, yet the disease mechanisms for SCT remain unclear. Employing a Flnb knockout mouse, we found that the intervertebral discs ( IVDs ) of Flnb–/–mice undergo rapid and progressive degeneration during postnatal development as a result of abnormal cell fate changes in the IVD, particularly the annulus fibrosus ( AF ). The AF cells lose their typical fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes. This change is characterized by hallmarks of endochondral-like ossification including alterations in collagen matrix, expression of Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossification of the disc tissue. We show that conversion of the AF cells into chondrocytes is coincident with upregulated TGFβ signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP induced p38 signaling as well as sustained activation of canonical and noncanonical target genes p21 and Ctgf.
Viruses, such as the orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus ( THOV ), have evolved mechanisms to target host antiviral responses. Here, we report that THOV targets the general transcription factor TFIIB by re-localizing it into the cytoplasm, generating a TFIIB depleted nuclear environment. Our data indicate that TFIIB is critical for the de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) to promoter start sites, but is not required for regulated gene expression from paused promoters. Since many immune genes require de novo recruitment of Pol II, targeting of TFIIB by THOV represents a mechanism to affect immune responses while keeping other cellular transcriptional activities intact. Thus, interference with TFIIB activity may be a favourable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation.
Human parvovirus B19 ( B19V ) infection of primary human erythroid progenitor cells ( EPCs ) causes cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2-phase, characterized by a 4N DNA content. The viral NS1 protein is a key factor in disrupting the cell cycle, and a putative C-terminal transactivation domain ( TAD2 ) within NS1 is responsible for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. The TAD2 domain plays a pivotal role in G2-phase arrest by activating the ATR ( ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related ) pathway. Activated ATR phosphorylates CDC25C at serine 216, which in turn inactivates the cyclin B/CDK1 complex without affecting nuclear import of the complex. The ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway is activated during B19V infection of EPCs, and ATR activation plays an important role in B19V infection-induced G2-phase arrest. Importantly, the DNA damage response ( DDR ) induced by B19V infection is essential for viral DNA replication but is dispensable for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a medically important mosquito-borne virus that causes disease ranging from uncomplicated dengue to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) and dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ), characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. DENV nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1 ) has been shown to induce endothelial hyperpermeability in a systemic mouse model and human pulmonary endothelial cells, where it disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx-like layer. Here, we investigated the relative contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways to DENV NS1-induced vascular leak. In vivo, we demonstrated that DENV NS1 triggers localized vascular leak in the dorsal dermis of wild-type C57BL/6 mice, but not in mice deficient in TLR4 or TNF-α receptor. In vitro, we showed that human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 do not produce inflammatory cytokines ( TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 ) and that blocking these cytokines does not affect DENV NS1-induced endothelial hyperpermeability. Finally, we demonstrated that DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in vivo can be blocked using inhibitors targeting molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption. Taken together, these data indicate that DENV NS1-induced endothelial cell-intrinsic vascular leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components.
In budding yeast, the integrity of the septin ring at the bud neck is crucial for cytokinesis, proper spindle positioning, and the spindle position checkpoint ( SPOC ). The SPOC delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis as long as the anaphase spindle does not properly align with the division axis. Here, we show that the redundant ubiquitin-ligases Dma1 and Dma2 control septin dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of the Elm1 kinase to the bud neck. Indeed, dma1 dma2 mutant cells show reduced levels of Elm1 at the bud neck and Elm1-dependent activation of Kin4. Artificial recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck of the same cells is sufficient to re-establish a normal septin ring, proper spindle positioning, and a proficient SPOC response in dma1 dma2 cells. Our data indicate that septin dynamics and SPOC function are intimately linked and support the idea that integrity of the bud neck is crucial for SPOC signalling. We propose a model for SPOC signalling where Dma1 and Dma2 regulate both septin ring dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud neck.
Humans have evolved to survive and thrive in a wide range of environments, and natural selection has likely played a central role in this adaptation. Here, we present the results of a genome-wide scan for evidence of positive selection in response to climatic variation. We find that SNPs with the strongest correlations between allele frequencies and climate across 61 worldwide populations are enriched for genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs. Among the most extreme signals, several overlap with those from genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ), including SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. We also find an enrichment of strong signals in gene sets related to UV radiation, infection and immunity, and cancer. Our results imply that adaptations to climate have shaped the spatial distribution of variation in humans.
Short QT syndrome ( SQTS ) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterised by an abbreviated QT interval and an increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. The N588K mutation in the rapid-delayed rectifier K+ current ( IKr ) -linked SQT1 variant of SQTS was studied using Markov chain ( MC ) and Hodgkin-Huxley ( HH ) models. MC models were found to be superior in reproducing experimental data regarding the effects of the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. These ionic channel models were incorporated into human ventricular action potential ( AP ) models and into 1D and 2D idealised and realistic transmural ventricular tissue simulations and into a 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588K mutation abbreviated ventricular cell AP duration at 90% repolarization ( APD90 ) and decreased the maximal transmural voltage heterogeneity ( δV ) during APs. This resulted in decreased transmural heterogeneity of APD90 and of the effective refractory period ( ERP ). However, with consideration of transmural heterogeneity of IKr density in the intact tissue model, not only did the N588K mutation lead to QT-shortening and increases in T-wave amplitude, but δV was found to be augmented in some local regions of ventricle tissue, resulting in increased tissue vulnerability for uni-directional conduction block and predisposing to formation of re-entrant excitation waves. In 2D and 3D tissue models, the N588K mutation facilitated and maintained re-entrant excitation waves due to the reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. Thus, in SQT1 the N588K-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular re-entry, increasing the lifespan of re-entrant spiral waves and the stability of scroll waves in 3D tissue.
Collective motion in groups of animals is a complex phenomenon that has been studied using a variety of simple models. However, these models may lack important elements necessary to predict the motion of each individual in the collective. Here, we report that deep attention networks can obtain a model of collective behaviour that is simultaneously predictive and insightful thanks to an organization in modules. Using simulated trajectories, the model recovers the ground-truth interaction rule used to generate them, as well as the number of interacting neighbours. For experimental trajectories of large groups of 60-100 zebrafish, the model obtains that interactions between pairs can be described as repulsive, attractive or as alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond only to alignment or alignment mixed with repulsion at close distances. The model also shows that each zebrafish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbours. The weights are higher for neighbours that are close, in a collision path or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. The network also extracts that the number of interacting individuals is dynamical and typically in the range 8–22, with 1–10 more important ones.
HIV-1 drug resistance is a major threat to the long-term efficacy of antiretroviral treatment, with around 10% of ART-naïve patients in Europe infected with drug-resistant HIV type 1. To understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance evolution, we employ a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV cohort. We model the viral phylogeny using stochastic birth–death–sampling processes with two types: hosts infected by a sensitive or resistant strain. This allows us to quantify fitness cost as the ratio between transmission rates of hosts infected by drug resistant strains and transmission rates of hosts infected by drug sensitive strains. We consider eight resistance mutations in the reverse transcriptase and one mutation in the protease gene. Among the considered resistance mutations, only the 90M mutation in the protease gene was found to have significantly higher fitness than the drug sensitive strains. The following mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were found to be less fit than the sensitive strains: 67N, 70R, 184V, 219Q. The remaining resistance mutations did not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility within the Swiss HIV cohort. These patterns are consistent with alternative measures of the fitness cost of resistance mutations. Overall, we have developed and validated a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations.
The Elongator complex, which includes the histone acetyl transferase Sin3/Elp3, has been shown to play a role in the modification of certain tRNAs. In this study, we show that the fission yeast Sin3/Elp3 is important for oxidative stress survival and that cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 are unable to modify the uridine wobble nucleoside of certain tRNAs. We also show that other tRNA modifying activities, such as Ctu1-Ctu2, are essential for normal tolerance to H2O2. We demonstrate that the main H2O2-dependent genes, including those coding for the transcription factors Atf1 and Pcr1, are highly expressed mRNAs containing a biased number of lysine-coding codons AAA versus AAG. These mRNAs are poorly translated after stress in cells lacking Sin3/Elp3 or Ctu2, whereas a mutated atf1 transcript with AAA-to-AAG lysine codons is efficiently translated in all strain backgrounds. Our results suggest that the lack of a functional Elongator complex results in stress phenotypes due to its contribution to tRNA modification and subsequent translation inefficiency of certain stress-induced, highly expressed mRNAs.
Nef is a viral protein required for sustained HIV-1 replication in vivo and is associated with accelerated progression to AIDS. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which Nef increases the infectivity of cell-free virions. We found that Nef renders HIV-1 virions refractory to the broadly-neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10, which target the membrane-proximal external region ( MPER ) of TMgp41. Nef conferred as much as 50-fold resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, but had no effect on neutralization by MPER-specific nAb Z13e1, the peptide inhibitor T20, nor by a panel of nAbs and other reagents targeting gp120. This effect was observed with Nef from a diverse range of HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as with HIV-1 virions bearing Env from CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic viruses, clade B and C viruses, or primary isolates. We found that this activity requires Nef myristoylation, but is genetically separable from other Nef functions such as the ability to enhance virus infectivity and to downregulate CD4. We also found that glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV substituted for Nef in conferring resistance to 2F5 and 4E10, indicating that this activity is conserved in a retrovirus that does not encode Nef.
Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos, the snail intermediate host of the carcinogenic liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini, is the leading cause of cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) in the Greater Mekong sub-region of Thailand. Despite the severe public health impact of Opisthorchis-induced CCA, little is known about the molecular interactions occurring between the parasite and its snail intermediate host. To address this knowledge gap, we characterized the transcriptomes of uninfected and O. viverrini-infected B. siamensis goniomphalos using high-throughput ( Illumina ) sequencing and extensive bioinformatic analyses. We identified 7, 655 differentially expressed genes ( DEGs ), associated with 43 distinct biological pathways, including immune defense mechanisms against parasites. Amongst the DEGs with immune functions, transcripts encoding distinct proteases displayed the highest down-regulation in Bithynia specimens infected by O. viverrini; conversely, transcription of genes encoding heat-shock proteins and actins was significantly up-regulated in parasite-infected snails when compared to the uninfected counterparts. The present study lays the foundation for functional studies of genes and gene products potentially involved in immune-molecular mechanisms implicated in the ability of the parasite to successfully colonize its snail intermediate host.
Complement receptor 1 ( CR1, CD35 ) has been identified as a mediator of Mycobacterium leprae entry into phagocytes. We investigated the role of CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 ( sCR1 ) levels in susceptibility to leprosy in a case-control study with Brazilian leprosy patients. Nine CR1 polymorphisms were haplotyped in 213 leprosy patients ( 47% multibacillary ) and 297 controls. We found that individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs3849266*T in intron 21 and rs3737002*T in exon 26 presented twice higher susceptibility to leprosy ( OR = 2. 43, p = 0. 017 ). Paucibacillary patients with these variants presented lower sCR1 levels, thus reducing the anti-inflammatory response ( p = 0. 040 and p = 0. 046, respectively ). Furthermore, the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form ( OR = 3. 04, p = 0. 01 ) and presented the intronic rs12034383*G allele, which was associated with higher gene expression ( p = 0. 043 ). We also found an inverse correlation between sCR1 levels and mannose-binding lectin ( initiator molecule of the lectin pathway of complement, recognized by CR1 ) ( R = -0. 52, p = 0. 007 ). Our results suggest a regulatory role for CR1 polymorphisms on mRNA and sCR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing susceptibility to leprosy, probably by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation.
Metabolomic profiling and whole-genome genetic association data have been used to comprehensively explore gene regulatory networks and investigate the effects of genetic variation at the molecular level. We investigated sex-specific differences of serum metabolite concentrations and their underlying genetic determination in more than 3, 300 independent individuals from the KORA F3 and F4 cohorts. Metabolite concentrations were measured for 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, and C6-sugars. A linear regression approach revealed significant concentration differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites ( p-values<3. 8×10−4; Bonferroni-corrected threshold ). Furthermore, sex-specific genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) showed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus ( carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1, significance level: p<3. 8×10−10; Bonferroni-corrected threshold ) for glycine. Our study provides new important insights into sex-specific differences of cell regulatory processes and underscores that studies should consider sex-specific effects in design and interpretation.
Genome-scale metabolic networks are widely used for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations. However, the solution space for the metabolic flux state of the cell is typically very large, and optimization-based approaches are necessary for predicting the active metabolic state under specific environmental conditions. The objective function used in such optimization algorithms is directly linked with the biological hypothesis underlying the model and is therefore one of the most relevant parameters for successful modeling. We show that the resulting optimization problem is sensitive towards stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network, leading to different simulation results when using numerically different but biochemically equivalent stoichiometry representations. This sensitivity makes biological interpretation intrinsically subjective and ambiguous. We propose a new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance ( MiMBl ), which decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of the desired objective functions. MiMBl casts objective functions using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. We demonstrate that the use of stoichiometry representation independent algorithms is fundamental for unambiguously linking modeling results with biological interpretation. MiMBl allowed us to expand the scope of metabolic modeling in elucidating the mechanistic basis of several genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Plague is a highly virulent, re-emerging disease in Madagascar, and the ecology of which has been scarcely studied in Africa. We investigated the relationship between plague distribution and the population genetic structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. We conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology, each covering about 150–200 km2 within the Madagascan plague focus. The seroprevalence levels in the rat populations mimicked those previously reported for humans. As expected, rat populations displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differs between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not related everywhere to the effective dispersal of rats. Genetic diversity estimates suggested that plague epizootics had only a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir. Human social activities may also be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic flatworm that causes schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The parasite's ability to maintain a long-term intravascular residence in its definitive host is due in part to the presence of a heptalaminate-covered, syncytial tegument on its surface. This surface layer is composed of a number of proteins, including members of the Ly6 family, which have been shown to induce protective immunity in experimental models. Here, we present a comprehensive reanalysis of the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family ( SmLy6A-K ), which extends the number of members to eleven, including three novel proteins. We show that the previously identified vaccine candidate Sm29 ( renamed SmLy6D ) is a unique double uPAR/Ly6 domain-containing representative and that all SmLy6 proteins are likely to be cell surface-bound due to the presence of canonical cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI-anchor sites. Using a cohort of S. mansoni-infected Ugandan males, we report IgG1 ( as well as IgG4 and IgE ) responses against two surface-bound representatives ( SmLy6A and SmLy6B ) before and after praziquantel treatment. We show that IgG1 levels against SmLy6A and SmLy6B drop significantly after treatment, while IgG1 levels against a sub-surface tegumental antigen, SmTAL1, rise.
Cells in the Drosophila retina have well-defined morphologies that are attained during tissue morphogenesis. We present a computer simulation of the epithelial tissue in which the global interfacial energy between cells is minimized. Experimental data for both normal cells and mutant cells either lacking or misexpressing the adhesion protein N-cadherin can be explained by a simple model incorporating salient features of morphogenesis that include the timing of N-cadherin expression in cells and its temporal relationship to the remodeling of cell-cell contacts. The simulations reproduce the geometries of wild-type and mutant cells, distinguish features of cadherin dynamics, and emphasize the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. The simulations also indicate that N-cadherin protein is recycled from inactive interfaces to active interfaces, thereby modulating adhesion strengths between cells. We demonstrate that the model describes characteristic shape changes in such mutants, distinguishes between different mechanisms of how cadherin levels are attained and controlled, and incorporates important dynamical features in morphogenesis, such as the temporal sequence of cadherin expression and cell-cell contact remodeling.
MT1-MMP is a membrane protease that plays a central role in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadopodia, which are membrane protrusions involved in cancer cell invasion. Previous studies have suggested that a continuous supply of MT1-MMP is required for ECM degradation, but the turnover rate of MT1-MMP and its contribution to ECM degradation at invadopodia have not been clarified. To address this problem, we performed FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching) experiments with fluorescence-tagged MT1-MMP on a single invadopodium and found that the recovery depended primarily on vesicle transport, with time constants of 26 s and 259 s. We then constructed a computational model based on the observed kinetics of the FRAP experiments and found that it successfully reproduced the experimental results. Next, we inhibited the vesicle transport both experimentally and in simulation, and found that it blocked ECM degradation. The degree of the reduction in ECM degradation depended on the degree of the reduction in the MT1-MMP turnover. Our experiments and simulations have established the role of the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP in ECM degradation at invadopodia, and our computational model provides a new tool to design and evaluate intervention strategies in cancer cell invasion.
HIV-1 drug resistance is a major obstacle in the treatment of HIV-1 infection. However, the process by which drug-resistant HIV-1 arises and spreads spatially within an infected individual is poorly understood. In this study, we used a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase ( RT-SHIVmne027 ) to examine how drug resistance spreads within a host and how spatial structure impacts its emergence. Four macaques were infected with RT-SHIVmne027 and treated with RT inhibitors to induce the emergence of two of the most prevalent drug resistance mutations ( DRMs ) in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase ( RT ) : K103N and M184V. We obtained comprehensive single-genome sequence ( SGS ) data from four different compartments ( peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymph node, vagina, and gut ) and the blood at four time points. The resulting sequences reveal a dynamic system in which viral RNA ( vRNA ) rapidly acquires drug resistance concomitantly across compartments through multiple independent mutations. The blood and lymph nodes were found to be compartmentalized rarely, while both the blood and lymph node were more frequently different from mucosal tissues. Our findings suggest that even oft-sampled blood does not fully capture the viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut where vRNA turnover was faster than the plasma and vDNA retained fewer wild-type viruses than other sampled compartments.
Morphogenesis is the process by which tissues and organs acquire their shape and form. Here we show that feedback regulation of stem or progenitor cell self-renewal can lead to growth bistability or bimodality, with ultrasensitive switching between high and low ( or zero ) growth states. A necessary condition for such behavior is the simultaneous presence of saturable positive and negative feedback. We mathematically define the conditions required for underlying phenomena such as bistability, ultrasensitivity and spatial self-organization to arise in such systems, and show how they can be used to drive the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds and fingers, which are the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis. We further show that even though such phenomena arise out of the opposing interactions of diffusible factors, the patterns that arise are not Turing patterns. We explore the effects of mixed feedback in final-state systems, which may be inherently better representations of lineage dynamics during morphogenesis, even in self-renewing tissues.
Myopia, or nearsightedness, is the most common eye disorder, resulting primarily from excess elongation of the eye. We report the largest ever genome-wide association study on myopia in Europeans, with 45, 771 participants. We performed a survival analysis on age of myopia onset and identified 22 significant associations, two of which are replications of earlier associations with refractive error. Ten of the 20 novel associations identified replicate in a separate cohort of 8, 323 participants who reported if they had developed myopia before age 10. These 22 associations explain 2. 9% of the variance in myopia age of onset and point toward a number of different mechanisms behind the development of myopia. One association is in the gene PRSS56, which has previously been linked to abnormally small eyes; one is in a gene that forms part of the extracellular matrix ( LAMA2 ) ; two are in or near genes involved in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal ( RGR and RDH5 ) ; two are near genes known to be involved in the growth and guidance of retinal ganglion cells ( ZIC2, SFRP1 ) ; and five are in or near genes involved in neuronal signaling or development. These novel findings point toward multiple genetic factors involved in the development of myopia and suggest that complex interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina may underlie the development of myopia in humans.
The role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming has been investigated using a closed-loop model. The lamprey has a central pattern generator ( CPG ) circuit that activates muscles for locomotion and adjusts the activity in response to sensory inputs from the environment. The CPG is modeled as chains of coupled oscillators, with pairs of phase oscillators representing the left and right sides of segments along the lamprey body. The emergent curvature of the body serves as an input to the CPG oscillators, closing the loop. We consider two forms of curvature-based feedback: directional feedback, which excites or inhibits oscillators on the same side depending on the sign of a chosen gain parameter, and magnitude feedback, which provides a symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effect to oscillators on both sides. We find that directional feedback does not affect beat frequency, but changes the duration of muscle activity. In contrast, magnitude feedback tends to increase beat frequency and reduces the energetic cost to the lamprey when the gain is high and positive. These results indicate that the same magnitude of curvature-based feedback on the CPG with different functional forms can cause distinct differences in swimming performance.
The global phylogeography of HIV is characterized by compartmentalized local epidemics dominated by a single subtype, indicating strong founder effects. We hypothesized that the competition of viral strains at the epidemic level may involve an advantage of the resident strain that was the first to colonize a population. To test this hypothesis, we developed a stochastic modelling framework to simulate HIV epidemics over dynamic contact networks. We simulated epidemics in which the second strain was introduced into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state epidemic, and assessed whether, and on what time scale, the second strain was able to spread in the population. We found that the spread of the second strain occurred on a much slower time scale compared with the initial expansion of the first strain. With strains of equal transmission efficiency, the second strain was unable to invade on a time scale relevant for the history of the HIV pandemic. To become dominant over a time scale of decades, the second strain needed a considerable ( >25% ) advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. The inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase. Our simulations confirmed a strong first comer advantage in the competition dynamics of HIV at the population level, which may explain the global phylogeography of the virus and may influence the future evolution of the pandemic.
The organization of muscle structure and function is a complex process that spans multiple length scales, from the sarcomere to the muscle bundle. We hypothesized that boundary conditions in the extracellular space potentiate the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for directed sarcomeregenesis. To test this hypothesis, we developed a quantitative model of how the cytoskeleton of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes organizes with respect to geometric cues in the extracellular matrix. Our results indicate that distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from two temporally-ordered, organizational processes: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. Our results suggest that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulate the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton and that a positive feedback loop is responsible for initiating the break in symmetry, potentiated by extracellular boundary conditions, is required to polarize the contractile cytoskeleton. Our model recapitulates the elegant protein choreography of the sarcomere assembly, where an ensemble of proteins assembles repetitively along the length of the actin fiber template.
Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacterium, is being trialled as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. We examined the invasive potential of the wMel Wolbachia strain in Brazilian Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in the laboratory and in the field. In the laboratory, we found that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission, and no evident detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. Next, we performed mark-release-recapture experiments in two areas of Rio de Janeiro where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future. We characterized the mosquito populations in relation to the socio-demographic conditions at these sites, and at three other future release areas. We constructed mathematical models using both the laboratory and field data, and used these to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood that the Wolbachia infection frequency could reach 100% following mosquito release. Our results suggest that the wMel strain of Wolbachia will likely be able to successfully invade five distinct field sites around the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We found that the most important factor influencing the spread of Wolbachia at any of the field sites was local mosquito abundance. Our results provide a useful framework for the ongoing field-releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti in Brazil, and will likely hold similar utility for future releases of these mosquitoes in other similarly heterogeneous urban landscapes.
Histone H3 lysine 4 methylation ( H3K4me ) is an important epigenetic modification that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression in plants. In this work, we identified a JmjC domain-containing protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses all three forms of H3K4me in rice. Loss-of-function mutation of the JMJ703 gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase ( CKX ) genes in the mutant. Analysis of the crystal structure of the catalytic core domain ( c-JMJ703 ) of the protein revealed a general structural similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD2 proteins that are H3K9 and H3K36 demethylases. However, several specific features were observed in the structure of c-JMJ703. Key residues that interact with cofactors Fe ( II ) and N-oxalylglycine and the methylated H3K4 substrate peptide were identified and were shown to be essential for the demethylase activity in vivo. These residues are conserved in known H3K4 demethylases, suggesting that they may be involved in the specificity for H3K4 demethylation. Our results demonstrate that JMJ703 is essential for plant cell division and stem elongation and specifically demethylates mono-, di-, and trimethylated H3K4 in vivo and in vitro.
The HIV-1 capsid is a critical component of the virus that plays a central role in all infectious steps, from reverse transcription to integration site selection. The capsid is the target of multiple host cell and pharmacologic ligands, but the mechanistic basis for how these ligands influence infection is not well understood. Here we show that a multi-subunit interface formed exclusively within CA hexamers mediates binding to linear epitopes within cellular cofactors NUP153 and CPSF6, and is competed for by the antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand is anchored via a shared phenylalanine-glycine ( FG ) motif to a pocket within the N-terminal domain of one monomer, and all but BI-2 also make essential interactions across the N-terminal domain: C-terminal domain ( NTD:CTD ) interface to a second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into CA monomers prevents high affinity interaction with CPSF6 and PF74, and abolishes binding to NUP153. The second interface is conformationally dynamic, but binding of NUP153 or CPSF6 peptides is accommodated by only one conformation. NUP153 and CPSF6 have overlapping binding sites, but each makes unique CA interactions that, when mutated selectively, perturb cofactor dependency. These results reveal that multiple ligands share an overlapping interface in HIV-1 capsid that is lost upon viral disassembly.
Dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya viruses are transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti, which has a large and poorly assembled genome. The current genome assembly contains 4, 758 scaffolds, few of which have been assigned to a chromosome. To improve the genome assembly, we scored a large number of SNPs in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypti and generated a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were found on the same scaffold. We corrected these errors and were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome. We found that there are large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres, which can extend to as much as 47% of the chromosome. To illustrate the utility of this new genome assembly, we mapped a gene that makes Ae. aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi, and generated a list of candidate genes that could be affecting the trait.
Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses, is a major target of vector control programs in tropical countries. Despite the availability of new trapping devices, most mosquito surveillance programs are still based on traditional household larval surveys. We report the results of a multicentric entomological survey using four types of traps ( ovitrap, MosquiTRAP, Adultrap, and BioGent-Sentinel ) to compare the entomological indices generated by these different surveillance tools in terms of their sensitivity to detect mosquito density variation. The study was conducted in five mid-sized cities representing variations of tropical climate regimens. Surveillance schemes using traps for adults or eggs were applied monthly to three 1 km2 areas per city. Simultaneously, larval surveys were performed. The House Index was consistently low in most cities, with median always 0. Traps rarely produced null indices, pointing to their greater sensitivity in detecting the presence of Ae. aegypti in comparison to the larval survey. All investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring the seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. Ideally, traps should be used in combination with vector control strategies to improve our response to dengue and other diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti.
APOBEC3G ( A3G ) is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses, including HIV-1, and is able to deaminate cytidines to uridines in single-stranded DNA replication intermediates. A3G contains two canonical cytidine deaminase domains ( CDAs ), of which only the C-terminal one is known to mediate cytidine deamination. By exploiting the crystal structure of the related tetrameric APOBEC2 ( A2 ) protein, we identified residues within A3G that have the potential to mediate oligomerization of the protein. Using yeast two-hybrid assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and chemical crosslinking, we show that tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127 within the enzymatically inactive N-terminal CDA domain mediate A3G oligomerization, and this coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. In addition to the importance of specific residues in A3G, oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent. Homology modelling of A3G onto the A2 template structure indicates an accumulation of positive charge in a pocket formed by a putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine residues at positions 24, 30, and 136 within this pocket resulted in reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization. We propose that occupation of the positively charged pocket by RNA promotes A3G oligomerization, packaging into virions and antiviral function.
The bric-a-brac locus in Drosophila melanogaster is a major-effect quantitative trait locus (QTL) responsible for variation in cuticular pigmentation. Here, we show that natural bric-a-brac alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation reflect a cumulative impact of polymorphisms that affect three functional regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. These polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level, as confirmed by analysis of allele-specific expression at the bric-a-brac locus. Our results establish that a single QTL can act through a confluence of multiple molecular mechanisms and that sequence variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can have significant quantitative effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. The bric-a-brac locus is composed of two anciently duplicated paralogs, bab1 and bab2, which are involved in patterning the adult abdomen, legs, and ovaries. Evolutionary changes in bric-a-brac regulation have played a central role in the macroevolutionary diversification of Drosophila color patterns.
Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcus ) is a persistent cause of invasive and mucosal disease in humans despite the widespread use of antibiotics and vaccines. Its ability to adapt through the uptake and incorporation of new genetic material from the surrounding microbial community is a key factor in its persistence. This adaptation is controlled by a tightly regulated quorum sensing system that is triggered by the extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide ( CSP ). We demonstrate that CSP can stimulate the production of a diverse array of blp bacteriocins. This cross stimulation occurs through increased production and secretion of the bacteriocin pheromone, BlpC, and requires a functional competence regulatory system. We show that a highly conserved motif in the promoter of the operon encoding BlpC and its transporter mediates the upregulation by CSP. The accumulation of BlpC following CSP stimulation results in augmented activation of the entire blp locus. Using biofilm-grown organisms as a model for competition and genetic exchange on the mucosal surface, we demonstrate that DNA exchange is enhanced by bacteriocin secretion, suggesting that co-stimulation of bacteriocins with competence provides an adaptive advantage. The blp and com regulatory pathways are believed to have diverged and specialized in a remote ancestor of pneumococcus, but have maintained a regulatory connection that promotes competition and adaptation by targeting for lysis a wide array of potential competitors while simultaneously providing the means for incorporation of their DNA.
Poliovirus IRES-mediated translation is dependent on the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA. The interaction between cellular proteins PCBP2 and SRp20 has been shown to function synergistically in viral translation. Here, we demonstrate that SRp20 dramatically re-localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of poliovirus-infected neuroblastoma cells during the course of infection. SRp20 partially co-localizes with PCBP2 in the cytoplasm of infected cells and is associated with PCBP2 bound to poliovirus RNA, indicating that this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. We generated a mutated version of SRp20 lacking the RNA recognition motif ( SRp20ΔRRM ) and found that this protein is localized similar to the full length SRp20 and partially co-localizes with PCBP2 during poliovirus infection. Expression of this mutated version of SRp20 results in a ∼100 fold decrease in virus yield for poliovirus when compared to expression of wild type SRp20, possibly via a dominant negative effect. These results are consistent with a model in which SRp20 interacts with PCBP2 bound to the viral RNA, and this interaction functions to recruit ribosomes to the viral RNA in a direct or indirect manner. The co-sedimentation of SRp20 and PCBP2 with 40S ribosomal subunits in extracts from poliovirus-infected cells is consistent with these proteins functioning in translation initiation complex formation for poliovirus IRES-mediated translation.
The neural crest ( NC ) is a population of embryonic stem cells that gives rise to various cell types, including neurons, glia, and melanocytes. Mutations in genes and pathways regulating NC development lead to neurocristopathies, a spectrum of human developmental disorders. To identify molecular pathways regulating NC development, we established an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ( ENU ) mutagenesis screen in a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10LacZ/+. Out of 71 pedigrees analyzed, we identified and mapped four heritable loci, called modifier of Sox10 expression pattern 1–4 ( msp1–4 ), which show altered NC patterning. The msp1 locus was identified as a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, Erbb3msp1, carrying a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the protein. Biochemical analysis of the mutant protein showed that ERBB3 is expressed on the cell surface, but its ligand-induced phosphorylation is dramatically reduced by the msp1 mutation. These findings highlight the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB3 receptor function and activation. This study underscores the utility of using an ENU mutagenesis screen to identify genetic pathways regulating NC development and to dissect the roles of discrete protein domains.
Schistosomiasis mansoni is a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni that affects millions of people worldwide. In this study, we investigated the factors that influence susceptibility to reinfection with S. mansoni in a rural Ugandan fishing community. We used data from a multi-disciplinary longitudinal reinfection study to examine the influence of age, sex, and ethnic background on susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminth drug treatment. We also investigated whether schistosome-specific IgE and IgG4 immune responses could account for any remaining variations in susceptibility to reinfection. We found that observed ethnic- and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, as opposed to biological differences in susceptibility to infection. However, age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure and appeared linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegumental antigen SmTAL1, which itself was significantly related to resistance to reinfection. This study highlights the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings to understand the ecology of a population and make more robust conclusions.
Clonorchiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the liver fluke Clonorchis sinensis. The number of eggs per gram of feces ( EPGs ) is the best method to estimate worm burden in infected humans. The present study investigated the correlation between EPGs and worm burden in human clonorchiasis. A total of 60 residents, 50 egg-positive and 10 egg-negative, from Sancheong-gun, Korea, participated in the study between 2006 and 2009. They were diagnosed by egg positivity in feces using the Kato-Katz method. After administration of praziquantel, they were purged with cathartics on the next day, and then discharged adult worms were collected from their feces. A positive correlation between EPGs and numbers of worms was demonstrated ( r = 0. 681, P<0. 001 ). Worm recovery rates were 9. 7% in cases of EPGs 1–1, 000 and 73. 7% in those of EPGs over 1, 000. No worms were detected from egg-negative subjects. The numbers of the worms are significantly correlated with the egg counts in human clonorchiasis. It is estimated that at least 110 worms are infected in a human body with EPGs around 3, 000, and egg productivity of a worm per day is around 4, 000.
Fluconazole resistance in Candida glabrata, a human fungal pathogen, is often mediated by gain-of-function mutations in the PDR1 gene. To identify novel targets for combination therapy, we performed an unbiased genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing a C. glabrata PDR1+ gain-of-function allele. Eighteen synthetically lethal S. cerevisiae genetic mutants were identified, one of which was the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5. Deletion or drug-mediated inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles. Moreover, deletion or drug-mediated inactivation of Gcn5 inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. We confirmed that loss of Gcn5 function is lethal in C. glabrata cells expressing the PDR1+L280F fluconazole resistant allele and demonstrated that chemically inhibiting Gcn5 renders both S. cerevisiae and the orthologous C. glabrata mutant inviable. These data demonstrate that targeting Gcn5, a synthetically lethal interacting partner of PDR1L280F, offers a new paradigm for the treatment of drug-resistant infection.
Poliovirus ( PV ) infection induces the formation of distinct membranous organelles that are involved in genome replication and virus assembly. The spatiotemporal dynamics of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate ( PI4P ) and membranous structures during PV infection have been studied in this work. Two PV mutants, termed EG and GG, which exhibit aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, were used to illuminate the pathway of formation of PV-induced membranous structures. Genome replication and/or virus assembly were substantially delayed in these mutants. Changes to the PI4P pool were observed as early as 30 min post-infection in wild-type PV. PI4P remodeling occurred even in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor, and was accompanied by formation of membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appeared in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 h post-infection, a time too slow for these structures to be responsible for genome replication. Our results are consistent with PV inducing temporally distinct membranous structures for genome replication ( tubules ) and virus assembly ( vesicular clusters ). We suggest that the pace of formation, spatiotemporal dynamics, and the efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion may be set by both the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and the capacity for P3 processing to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins.
Chagas disease is a neglected trypanosomiasis with enormous social and economic impact in most countries of Latin America. In order to develop new and more effective drugs with fewer side effects than the currently available chemotherapy, a multi-step cascade strategy was developed to identify new molecular classes of cruzain inhibitors by focusing on non-peptidic non-covalent ligands. We carried out virtual screening of the ZINC Database using ligand- and target-based virtual screening methods, followed by enzymatic assays, X-ray crystallography and structure-activity relationship ( SAR ) studies of the most promising hits. This approach led to the identification of 12 non-covalent binding cruzain inhibitors with affinity values in the low micromolar range ( 3–60 µM ) acting through a competitive inhibition mechanism. The most potent cruzain inhibitors were assayed against T. cruzi-infected cells and two compounds were found to have trypanocidal activity. Using compound Nequimed42 as precursor, an SAR was established in which the 2-acetamidothiophene-3-carboxamide group was identified as essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition activities. The IC50 value for compound Nequimed42 acting against the trypomastigote form of the Tulahuen lacZ strain was found to be 10. 6±0. 1 µM, tenfold lower than that obtained for benznidazole, which was taken as positive control.
Yellow fever ( YF ) remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in tropical areas of the world. The only available vaccine against YF is the attenuated YF virus 17D/17DD vaccine, which generates both long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and strong T-cell responses. However, this vaccine has toxic side effects that can be fatal on rare occasions. This study presents the development and evaluation of two non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations against YF. The two formulations consist of DNA encoding the full-length envelope protein ( p/YFE ) or the full-length envelope protein fused to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal, LAMP-1 ( pL/YFE ). The immune responses triggered by these formulations were evaluated in H2b and H2d backgrounds, corresponding to the C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice strains, respectively. Both DNA constructs were able to induce very strong T-cell responses of similar magnitude against almost all epitopes that are also generated by the YF 17DD vaccine. The pL/YFE formulation performed best overall. In addition to the T-cell response, it was also able to stimulate high titers of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies comparable to the levels elicited by the 17DD vaccine. More importantly, the pL/YFE vaccine conferred 100% protection against the YF virus in intracerebrally challenged mice. These results indicate that pL/YFE DNA is an excellent vaccine candidate and should be considered for further developmental studies.
The nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA has been identified as a direct transcriptional activator of the chitobiose utilization genes in Vibrio cholerae. Chitobiose is a chitin disaccharide that is required for the persistence and evolution of V. cholerae in the marine environment. The chb operon encodes genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of chitobiose, and is regulated by the orphan sensor kinase ChiS. However, the mechanisms downstream of ChiS activation that result in expression of the chb operon are poorly understood. Using an unbiased transposon mutant screen, we found that SlmA is a regulator of the chb operon. SlmA is a member of the TetR family of proteins, which are generally transcriptional repressors. However, we found that SlmA binds directly to the chb operon promoter and is required for transcriptional activation of this locus and for chitobiose utilization. We also found that DNA-binding, but not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for transcriptional activation. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcriptional regulator in V. cholerae in addition to its established role as a cell division licensing factor.
We present a novel nonlinear programming ( NLP ) framework for solving computationally challenging parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Such problems involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations as well as many experimental data sets and parameters. The proposed framework is computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. It uses a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and enables the use of computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed framework by solving estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. We show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1, 704 experimental data points can be solved in less than 3 minutes, while an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours. We also create large instances to show that the proposed framework is scalable and can solve problems with up to 2, 352 parameters, 2, 304 differential equations, and 20, 352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The proposed framework is flexible and can be broadly applied to dynamic models of biological systems, enabling the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, perform model selection, and handle outliers.
West Nile virus ( WNV ) dissemination and the inflammatory response against WNV in the outbred Swiss Webster ( SW ) mouse model were evaluated using the nCounter, a high throughput digital gene expression system. The nCounter Mouse Inflammation gene expression kit containing 179 inflammation related genes was used to analyze gene expression changes in multiple tissues over a nine day course of infection in SW mice following intraperitoneal injection with WNV. Expression analysis of spleen, lung, liver, kidney and brain of SW mice infected with WNV revealed that Cxcl10 and Il12b are differentially expressed in all tissues tested except kidney. Data stratification of positively confirmed infected ( WNV ( + ) ) versus non-infected ( WNV ( − ) tissues allowed differentiation of the systemic inflammatory gene response from tissue-specific responses arising from WNV infection. Significant changes in gene expression were found in WNV ( − ) spleen, lung, liver and brain tissues. In WNV ( + ) livers, Stat1, Tlr2, chemokines Cxcl1, Cxcl3, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, cytokines Il6, Il18, cytokine-related gene Il1r and cytokine agonist Ilrn were significantly upregulated. In WNV ( − ) brain tissues, Csf2 and Cxcl10 were significantly upregulated. Similar gene and protein expression kinetics were found for Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4 and Ccl5 and correlated with the presence of infectious virus.
During an outbreak of rabies in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique in 2014, we investigated the epidemiology, clinical features and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites. We reviewed cases of human rabies and animal bites from April to July 2014 and conducted a community investigation in July and August in the neighborhoods where cases of human rabies resided. We detected 14 cases of human rabies, all of whom had a recent history of dog bite, and 819 cases of animal bites, of which 97. 8% were caused by dogs. Only one of the 14 rabid dogs had been immunized. Factors significantly associated with human rabies were: age <15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by unimmunized dog, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. We found that implementation of control measures for rabies is poor in Maputo and Matola cities, where cases of human rabies were strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular implementation of post-exposure measures.
The SCN9A gene, which encodes the Nav1. 7 subunit of the voltage-gated sodium channel, has been identified as a potential cause of febrile seizures ( FS ) in a large Utah family. A highly conserved amino acid mutation, p. N641Y, in the SCN9A gene was found in 21 affected family members and was absent in 586 ethnically matched population control chromosomes. To establish a functional role for this mutation in seizure susceptibility, we introduced the orthologous mutation into the murine Scn9a ortholog using targeted homologous recombination. Homozygous Scn9aN641Y/N641Y knockin mice exhibited significantly reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures, and increased corneal kindling acquisition rates compared to wild-type mice. These data strongly support the SCN9A p. N641Y mutation as disease-causing in this family. In addition, we analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients and identified additional highly conserved Nav1. 7 missense variants in 5% of the patients. Furthermore, we sequenced the SCN1A gene in a child with FS who later developed Dravet syndrome and identified a heterozygous frameshift mutation. Subsequent analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients yielded nine Nav1. 7 missense variants ( 8% of the patients ), all in highly conserved amino acids. This study provides evidence for a role of SCN9A in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations.
Morphogenesis, the process by which complex tissue shapes arise through growth, has been a long-standing problem in biology. Here we present the Growing Polarised Tissue ( GPT ) framework, a polarity-based system that can generate a wide range of biological forms through combinatorial interactions between tissue polarity and growth. Tissue is treated as a continuous material within which regionally expressed factors under genetic control may interact and propagate. Polarity is established by signals that propagate through the tissue and is anchored in regions termed tissue polarity organisers that are also under genetic control. Rates of growth parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity may then be specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth depends on how specified growth patterns interact within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue. This constraint leads to the emergence of features such as curvature that were not directly specified by the regulatory networks. We illustrate the value of the GPT-framework for understanding morphogenesis by applying it to a growing Snapdragon flower and indicate how the underlying hypotheses may be tested by computational simulation. We propose that combinatorial interactions between orientations and rates of growth, which are a key feature of polarity-based systems, have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes.
During early HIV infection, multiple CD8+ T cell responses are elicited almost simultaneously, exerting strong selective pressures on different parts of the virus’s genome and selecting for mutations that escape recognition and are beneficial to the virus. These escape mutations can emerge at different times, and it has been observed that the later they emerge, the more slowly they go to fixation. This pattern of escape rate decrease ( ERD ) can arise by distinct mechanisms, including interference among different escape strains. In this study, we investigated how interference between these concurrent escape mutations affects their escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes, and whether it could be a source of the ERD pattern. We developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation and recombination, as well as an interference-free null model assuming initial neutral evolution before immune response elicitation. We found that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern, and that the number of loci and recombination rates substantially affect ERD. We also found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations as well as interference effects. Our results confirm that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations, and that accounting for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations demands novel estimation methodologies based on the analysis of HIV strains, rather than mutation frequencies.
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with resectable disease require effective preoperative chemotherapy to eliminate micrometastasis and improve operability. In this study, we developed a mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment to estimate the cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens in NSCLC. The model takes into account the cancer-related mechanisms of uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. We applied the model to the retrospective data of 13 patients with NSCLC who received cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel in the neoadjuvant context. The selection of model input values was guided by a comprehensive literature survey on cancer-specific proliferation kinetics. A Latin hypercube sampling approach was used to compensate for patient-specific uncertainties. Our results show that the volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis are key features for more accurate estimates of cell killing efficacy. We estimated a range of plausible values for the cell killing efficacy of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens, expressed as the sum of cell kill rates of the two drugs considered. Our methodology provides a quantitative framework for the estimation of in vivo cell killing ability of various chemotherapies, which could serve as a basis for reliable personalized predictions.
Bacteria growing in biofilms are known to exhibit high levels of antibiotic tolerance, which is distinct from inherited antibiotic resistance. In this study, we used random transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific tolerant mutants in Escherichia coli. We found that biofilms formed by amino acid auxotroph mutants are highly tolerant to the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ofloxacin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that amino acid starvation significantly increases the tolerance of biofilm bacteria to ofloxacin. We also showed that the biofilm-specific tolerance to ofloxacin is fully dependent on a functional SOS response upon starvation to both amino acids and carbon source, and partially dependent on the stringent response upon leucine starvation. However, the biofilm-specific ofloxacin tolerance does not involve any of the SOS-induced toxin–antitoxin systems previously associated with the formation of highly tolerant persisters. We further demonstrated that ofloxacin tolerance is induced as a function of biofilm age, which is dependent on the SOS response.
Plasmodium falciparum merozoites invade human erythrocytes to initiate the intra-erythrocytic stage of the parasite life cycle, which is responsible for all pathogenesis and death associated with P. falciparum malaria. Invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum merozoites is a complex multi-step process mediated by specific molecular interactions between red cell surface receptors and parasite protein ligands that reside in apical membrane-bound organelles known as micronemes and rhoptries. Timely secretion of these parasite ligands to the merozoite surface is critical for successful invasion. Here, we identify cAMP as a key regulator that triggers the timely secretion of microneme proteins enabling receptor-engagement and invasion. We demonstrate that exposure of merozoites to a low K+ environment, typical of blood plasma, activates a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adenylyl cyclase to raise cytosolic cAMP levels and activate protein kinase A, which regulates microneme secretion. We also show that cAMP regulates merozoite cytosolic Ca2+ levels via induction of an Epac pathway and demonstrate that increases in both cAMP and Ca2+ are essential to trigger microneme secretion.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted nematode, is one of the most neglected among the neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ). We conducted a systematic literature review of 354 studies from 78 countries to obtain country-specific prevalence estimates of S. stercoralis infection in the general population and to assess the association between S. stercoralis prevalence and different risk groups. A Bayesian meta-analysis was carried out to compare disease odds ratios in different risk groups taking into account the sensitivities of the diagnostic methods applied. The meta-analysis showed an association between HIV-infection and S. stercoralis infection ( OR: 2. 17; 95% CI: 1. 18–4. 01 ), and between alcoholism and S. stercoralis infection ( OR: 6. 69; 95% CI: 1. 47–33. 8 ). Our findings show high infection prevalence rates in the general population in selected countries and geographical regions. S. stercoralis infection is prominent in several risk groups, including refugees, immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from deployment in endemic areas. In developed countries, S. stercoralis remains an issue for immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from deployment in endemic areas, and may call for systematic screening after visits to endemic countries and before initiation of immuno-suppressive treatment.
Stochastic noise at the cellular level plays a fundamental role in circadian oscillations, influencing how groups of cells entrain to external cues and generating cell-autonomous rhythms. However, few studies have investigated how clock perturbations affect stochastic noise. In this study, we show that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall stochastic noise. Using cell-autonomous fibroblast data, we demonstrate that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. We also show that the damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators, and confirm that such a change can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. We further demonstrate the insights that can be gained by applying our method to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. Finally, we hypothesize that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as very few gene perturbations are capable of simultaneously increasing amplitude and lowering stochastic noise.
FtsZ is an essential protein in bacterial cell division that has been identified as a promising target for the development of new antimicrobial drugs to combat the increasing problem of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Recent studies have shown that the allosteric inhibitor PC190723 has in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus FtsZ and in vivo antimicrobial activity. However, the mechanism of drug action and its effect on FtsZ in other bacterial species are unclear. Here, we examine the structural environment of the PC190723 binding pocket in FtsZ from different bacterial species using a statistical method called PocketFEATURE and molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations. Our results show that species and nucleotide-binding state have significant impacts on the structural properties of the binding site, with substantially disparate microenvironments for bacterial species not from the Staphylococcus genus. We predict that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state and that polymerization of FtsZ may enhance PC190723 binding. Our results demonstrate that a drug-binding pocket can vary significantly across species, genetic perturbations, and in different polymerization states, yielding important information for the further development of FtsZ inhibitors.
Lentiviral integrase ( IN ) is a protein that plays a critical role in the integration of viral DNA into the host genome. The cellular protein lens epithelium derived growth factor ( LEDGF ), also known as PC4 and SFRS1 interacting protein 1 ( PSIP1 ) and transcriptional co-activator p75, is the cellular binding partner of lentiviral IN proteins and is required for efficient viral replication. We now present the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core domains ( NTD and CCD ) of HIV-2 IN in complex with the IN binding domain ( IBD ) of LEDGF. The structure reveals primarily charge–charge interactions between the NTD of IN and the IBD of LEDGF. A constellation of acidic residues on the NTD is characteristic of lentiviral INs, and mutations of the positively charged residues on the IBD severely affect interaction with all lentiviral INs tested. We show that the novel NTD–IBD contacts are critical for stimulation of concerted lentiviral DNA integration by LEDGF in vitro and for its function during the early steps of HIV-1 replication. Furthermore, the new structural details enabled us to engineer a mutant of HIV-1 IN that primarily functions only when presented with a complementary LEDGF mutant. These findings provide a structural basis for the high affinity lentiviral IN–LEDGF interaction and pave the way for the development of LEDGF-based targeting technologies for gene therapy.
Cancer stem cells are a subpopulation of cells within a tumor that have the ability to initiate and sustain tumor growth. These cells have an intrinsic set of kinetics that dictate their behavior, including cell migration, proliferation potential, spontaneous cell death, and symmetric cancer stem cell division. We have developed a cellular automaton model that tracks the temporal evolution of cancer stem cells to investigate the emerging intratumoral heterogeneity and determine the evolutionary trajectories of the combination of cell-intrinsic kinetics that yield aggressive tumor growth. Our study suggests that cell proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth. Early increase in proliferation potential yields larger populations of non-stem cancer cells that compete with cancer stem cells and thus inhibit cancer stem cell division, while a reduction in proliferation potential loosens such inhibition and facilitates frequent cancer stem cell division. The sub-population of cancer stem cells in itself becomes highly heterogeneous, dictating population level dynamics that vary from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression. We have identified a set of orthogonal cell kinetics that include cell migration rate, proliferation potential, spontaneous cell death, and symmetric cancer stem cell division. Our study suggests that the clonal diversity that is captured in single tumor biopsy samples represents only a small proportion of the total number of phenotypes.
Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A ( H5N1 ). Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation.
Influenza A virus ( AIV ) migration and persistence in North American wild birds have been poorly understood, hampering the prediction of viral spread and the formulation of preparedness plans. We analyzed 287 newly sequenced AIV samples collected over a 34-year period from North American migratory birds. Using a Bayesian statistical framework, we tested hypotheses of viral migration, population structure and patterns of genetic reassortment. Our results show that despite the high prevalence of Charadriiformes infected in Delaware Bay, this host population does not appear to significantly contribute to the North American AIV diversity sampled in Anseriformes. In contrast, influenza viruses sampled from Anseriformes in Alberta are representative of the AIV diversity circulating in North American Anseriformes. We found that while AIV may be restricted to specific migratory flyways over short time frames, the long-term persistence of AIV is independent of bird flyways, with migration between populations occurring throughout North America. Our analysis of long-term surveillance data provides vital insights for developing predictive models critical for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection.
Influenza A viruses are classified into 16 antigenically distinct subtypes based on their hemagglutinin ( HA ) surface glycoproteins. Most neutralizing antibodies are specific to a particular HA subtype and do not cross-react with other subtypes. However, a novel monoclonal antibody ( MAb ), MAb S139/1, has been generated that shows heterosubtypic cross-reactive neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition of influenza A viruses. MAb S139/1 was found to react with HA subtypes H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13 in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) and showed neutralization and hemagglutination-inhibition activities against particular strains of H1, H2, H3, and H13 subtypes. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb S139/1 were selected from the A/Aichi/2/68 ( H3N2 ), A/Adachi/2/57 ( H2N2 ), and A/WSN/33 ( H1N1 ) strains, and sequence analysis of the HA genes of these escape mutants revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193. A molecular modeling study showed that these amino acids were located on the globular head of the HA and formed a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain of HA. Furthermore, passive immunization of mice with MAb S139/1 provided heterosubtypic protection.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasitic worm, is a major public health concern in remote Aboriginal communities of northern Australia, with prevalence rates as high as 30–40%. A three-year cohort study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in controlling S. stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study included 259 adult Aboriginals living in a remote community in northern Australia. S. stercoralis infection was diagnosed using a commercial ELISA kit with a lower threshold for treatment than recommended. Follow-up was conducted at 6 months and 3 years following ivermectin treatment. The results showed that treatment with ivermectin was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection, from 35. 3% at baseline to 5. 8% at 3 years ( McNemar’s chi2 = 56. 5, p<0. 001 ). The study also suggested that using a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. However, a small group of subjects had persistently positive ELISA serology despite repeated treatment. The study provides evidence that control of chronic S. stercoralis infection in an adult Aboriginal population may be achieved through a process of case finding and treatment, using the current best practice guidelines for treatment.
Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein, PrPSc. Prion strains are hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrPSc and can interfere with each other when a long-incubation period strain ( blocking strain ) inhibits the conversion of a short-incubation period strain ( non-blocking strain ). However, it is unknown if two long-incubation period strains can interfere with each other. Here, we show that co-infection of animals with combinations of long-incubation period strains failed to identify evidence of strain interference. To exclude the possibility that this inability of strains to interfere in vivo was due to a failure to infect common populations of neurons, we used protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference ( PMCAsi ). Consistent with the animal bioassay studies, PMCAsi indicated that both co-infecting strains were amplifying independently, suggesting that the lack of strain interference is not due to a failure to target the same cells but is an inherent property of the strains involved. Importantly, PMCA reactions seeded with long incubation-period strains contained relatively higher levels of remaining PrPC compared to reactions seeded with a short-incubation period strain. We hypothesize that the abundance of PrPC is not limiting in vivo or in vitro, resulting in prion strains with relatively low prion conversion efficiency to amplify independently.
Allosteric regulation is an important mechanism by which proteins control their activity in response to ligand binding. Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions ( IDPs/IDRs ) are prevalent in allosteric regulation, and it was previously thought that intrinsic disorder is favorable for maximizing the allosteric coupling. Here, we propose a comprehensive ensemble model to compare the roles of both order-order transition and disorder-order transition in allosteric effect. Our model reveals that the MWC pathway ( order-order transition ) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway ( disorder-order transition ) in allostery, suggesting a complicated role of IDPs/IDRs in regulatory proteins. We also obtain an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response, which shows that too stable or too unstable states are unfavorable to endow allostery. Our results suggest that the reasons for the prevalence of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation are more complicated than previously thought. We propose that IDPs/IDRs can implement allosteric effect under the lack of ordered structures by stabilizing specific states and shifting the conformational ensemble. The prevalence of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation is determined by all their advantages, but not only by their capacity in endowing allostery.
Prostate cancer is a major cause of male death in the Western world, but few frequent genetic alterations that drive prostate cancer initiation and progression have been identified. β-Catenin is essential for many developmental processes and has been implicated in tumorigenesis in many tissues, including prostate cancer. We have used in vivo genetic studies in the embryo and adult to extend our understanding of the role of β-Catenin in the normal and neoplastic prostate. Our gene deletion analysis revealed that prostate epithelial β-Catenin is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching but is dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin controls the number of progenitors in the epithelial buds and regulates a discrete network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3. 1. β-Catenin overexpression in combination with Pten loss was able to drive progression to invasive carcinoma together with squamous metaplasia. These studies demonstrate that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that an inherent property of high levels of this protein in prostate epithelia is to drive squamous fate differentiation. In addition, they show that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of this disease.
Informed consent is a critical component of biomedical research, particularly in developing countries where disease burden is high. However, there is a need to tailor the consent process to the social and cultural context of the community and potential research participants. We conducted a qualitative study in southern Ethiopia to assess determinants of and approaches to gaining informed consent for a genetic study on podoconiosis ( non-filarial elephantiasis ). The study involved focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews with podoconiosis patients, non-patients, fieldworkers, researchers, local NGO staff, and community leaders. We found that the extent of use of everyday language, the degree to which expectations of potential participants were addressed, and the techniques of presentation of information had a considerable impact on comprehension of information provided about the research. Approaching podoconiosis patients via locally trusted individuals and preceding individual consent with community sensitization were considered the optimal means of communication. We also found that prevailing poverty among podoconiosis patients, the absence of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local NGO were potential barriers for obtaining genuine informed consent.
T cell proliferation in the immune system is a complex process that involves cell proliferation, differentiation, selection, death, and migration of lymphocytes from the thymus to peripheral tissues. Quantifying cell proliferation dynamics requires specific experimental methods and mathematical modelling. Here, we investigate the impact of genetics and aging on the immune system by examining the proliferation dynamics of T lymphocytes across their differentiation stages in the thymus and spleen of mice. We use single-cell multicolour flow cytometry analysis and a generic mathematical model based on Ordinary Differential Equations ( ODEs ) to simulate the evolution of single cell behaviour during various durations of labelling. Our model allows us to fit our data, deduce proliferation rates, and estimate cell cycle durations in sub-populations. Our results reveal that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous and depends on genetic origins, cell differentiation stages in the thymus and spleen, and is altered with age. Our model allows us to infer proliferation rates and cell cycle phase durations from complex experimental data, revealing T cell proliferation heterogeneity and specific signatures.
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) mutations are a common cause of human disease, and about half of these mutations occur in tRNA genes. We report the generation and characterization of the first mitochondrial tRNA pathological mutation in mouse cells, an m. 3739G>A transition in the mitochondrial mt-Ti gene. This mutation recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation described in humans, an m. 4290T>C transition affecting also the human mt-Ti gene. We demonstrate that the pathogenic molecular mechanism induced by both the mouse and human mutations is a high frequency of abnormal folding of the tRNAIle that cannot be charged with isoleucine. We also show that the cells harboring the mouse or human mutant tRNA have exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by an increase in mitochondrial ROS production as a compensatory response. This compensatory mechanism can explain the penetrance pattern of this mutation. We propose that the nature of the pathogenic mechanism combined with the existence of a compensatory mechanism can allow a scenario for the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs in which the fixation of two alleles that are individually deleterious can proceed in two steps and not require the simultaneous mutation of both.
Human triploid cells, which have three sets of chromosomes instead of the normal two, have been found to have an unbalanced expression of X-linked genes compared to autosomal genes. In triploid cells with two active X chromosomes, the expression of X-linked genes is approximately doubled compared to diploid cells. However, in triploid cells with only one active X chromosome, the expression of X-linked genes is further increased, suggesting an epigenetic adjustment in response to the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets. The expression of autosomal genes, on the other hand, is similar in triploid and diploid cells and is strictly proportional to the number of autosomal sets. We found that a small subset of X-linked genes ( ∼7% ) has expression levels that are proportional to the number of autosomal sets, suggesting that they are regulated in a dosage-sensitive manner. These genes are preferentially located on the short arm of the human X chromosome. Overall, our results indicate that the expression of X-linked genes in triploid cells does not strictly respond to an autosomal counting factor and is instead adjusted by an epigenetic mechanism that senses the ratio between the number of active X chromosomes and autosomal sets.
The dN/dS ratio is a widely used measure to quantify evolutionary pressures on proteins by comparing substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. However, this measure was originally developed for application to distantly diverged sequences, where differences represent substitutions that have fixed along independent lineages. Here, we study the expected dN/dS ratio for samples drawn from a single population, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms. We find that in this context, dN/dS is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient, and the hallmark signature of positive selection over divergent lineages, dN/dS>1, is violated within a population. Moreover, the relationship between selection and dN/dS does not follow a monotonic function, and so it may be impossible to infer selection pressures from dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples. Our results have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements among population-genetic samples, as standard tests for selection based on dN/dS are extremely sensitive to violation of the assumption of divergent lineages.
The effect of natural selection on linked neutral divergence between closely and distantly related species has been a long-standing issue in evolutionary biology. Here we show that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species. We find that neutral divergence between closely related species ( e. g. human-primate ) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. We also find that neutral divergence between distantly related species ( e. g. human-rodent ) is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors such as hypermutable CpG sites, GC content, and biased gene conversion. Coalescent models indicate that even when the contribution of ancestral polymorphism to divergence is small, background selection in the ancestral population can still explain a large proportion of the variance in divergence across the genome.
Circadian oscillations in Drosophila are governed by a transcriptional-translational negative feedback loop in which the CLOCK ( CLK ) and CYCLE ( CYC ) bHLH-PAS domain transcription factors activate the expression of the period ( per ) and timeless ( tim ) genes. CLK is the key rhythmic component of the circadian activator in Drosophila, with its DNA-binding and transcriptional activity showing a robust oscillation with an evening peak. In this study, we investigated the role of the CK2 kinase in the control of CLK phosphorylation and function. We show that CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes CLK, while reducing its transcriptional activity. Downregulation of the catalytic α subunit of CK2 induces CLK degradation, even in the absence of PER and TIM. Unexpectedly, the regulatory β subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme is not required for the regulation of CLK stability. In addition, downregulation of CK2α activity decreases CLK phosphorylation and increases per and tim transcription. These results indicate that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. Since the CK1 kinase promotes CLK degradation, we suggest that CLK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas' disease, interacts with the invertebrate host Rhodnius prolixus during its life cycle. We investigated the role of cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase, in this interaction. We treated T. cruzi epimastigotes with anti-cruzipain antibodies or a panel of cysteine peptidase inhibitors ( cystatin, antipain, E-64, leupeptin, iodocetamide or CA-074-OMe ) and analyzed their effect on parasite adhesion to R. prolixus posterior midgut ex vivo. All treatments, except CA074-OMe, significantly decreased parasite adhesion to R. prolixus midgut. Cystatin presented a dose-dependent reduction on the adhesion. We compared the adhesion rate among several T. cruzi isolates and found that the G isolate, which naturally possesses low levels of active cruzipain, adhered to a lesser extent in comparison to Dm28c, Y and CL Brener isolates. Transgenic epimastigotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, chagasin, and that have reduced levels of active cruzipain adhered to the insect gut 73% less than the wild-type parasites. The adhesion of pCHAG parasites was partially restored by the addition of exogenous cruzipain. In vivo colonization experiments revealed low levels of pCHAG parasites in comparison to wild-type. Parasites isolated after passage in the insect presented a drastic enhancement in the expression of surface cruzipain.
Cytoplasmic dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes during mitosis, including centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase spindle elongation, and chromosome segregation, as well as during interphase for vesicle transport and organelle positioning. However, the mechanisms that target and regulate cytoplasmic dynein remain largely unknown. To identify potential regulators of cytoplasmic dynein, we conducted a genome-wide screen for modifiers of dynein function in Caenorhabditis elegans using a sensitized genetic background. We isolated and characterized twenty dynein-specific suppressor genes that, when reduced in function, suppress cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutants but not other conditionally mutant loci. Twelve of these suppressor genes do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when their function is reduced in wild-type worms. We also identified four putative dynein accessory chains that, when reduced in function, suppress cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. Furthermore, we identified 29 additional genes that, when reduced in function, suppress not only cytoplasmic dynein but also loci required for unrelated essential processes.
During programmed genome rearrangements ( PGR ) in the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, physiological DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) drive the elimination of at least 45, 000 germline sequences ( Internal Eliminated Sequences, IESs ) from the somatic nucleus. This process involves a domesticated transposase, PiggyMac, for DNA cleavage, and the Ligase IV component of the non-homologous end-joining ( NHEJ ) pathway for DSB repair at excision sites. To understand how DNA cleavage and DSB repair are coordinated during PGR, we have focused on Ku, the earliest actor of NHEJ-mediated repair. We show that the development-specific Ku70/Ku80c heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus, and that PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage is abolished at IES boundaries in cells depleted for Ku80c, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. We conclude that Ku has been integrated in the Paramecium DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR. Our findings point to the participation of the development-specific Ku70-Ku80c heterodimer in Pgm-dependent DNA cleavage, upstream of its likely function in C-NHEJ-mediated DSB repair.
Prion diseases are characterized by a long pre-clinical incubation period during which time the infectious prion particle and infectivity steadily propagate in the brain. However, the molecular events that accompany early neuronal damage and ultimately conclude with neuronal death remain obscure. In this study, we used laser capture microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons and determined their pre-clinical transcriptional response during prion infection. We found that gene expression within these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases of activity. A major cluster of genes is altered during pre-clinical disease after which expression either returns to basal levels, or alternatively undergoes a direct reversal during clinical disease. This cluster contains a signature highly reminiscent of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid ( NMDA ) receptor signaling and the activation of neuroprotective pathways. Additionally, genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered throughout the disease, culminating in a general decline of gene expression for synaptic proteins. Deregulated miRNAs such as miR-132-3p, miR-124a-3p, miR-16-5p, miR-26a-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-140-5p follow concomitant patterns of expression. Our findings suggest that prion replication results in the persistent stimulation of a programmed response that is mediated, at least in part, by synaptic NMDA receptor activity that initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodelling.
Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that causes experimental visceral leishmaniasis in mice, characterized by the formation of granulomas in the liver. To better understand granuloma formation and function, we have developed an in silico Petri net model that simulates granuloma development throughout the course of infection. The model was extensively validated by comparison with data from experimental studies in mice and robustness was assessed by sensitivity analysis. The model recapitulated the progression of disease seen during experimental infection and predicted changes in cellular composition within granulomas over time. By conducting in silico experiments, we have identified a previously unappreciated level of inter-granuloma diversity in terms of anti-leishmanial activity. Our data suggest that IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells at the core of the granuloma plays a dominant local regulatory role. The model only simulates events within the granuloma that lead to control of parasite load and does not take into account possible regulatory effects of IL-10 outside this environment.
Transcriptional regulation can be viewed as a computational device, with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as the output. We show that different parameterizations of a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation are able to approximate all four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as various equality and inequality operations. This is in contrast to other studies that emphasize logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks. We analyze the accuracy and precision of these approximations, showing that they depend on different sets of parameters, and are thus independently tunable. We demonstrate that networks of these “arithmetic” genes can be combined to accomplish yet more complicated computations by designing and simulating a network that detects statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. We also consider the problem of approximating analytic functions, showing that this can be achieved by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. These observations are important for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and imply new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.
Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) is an RNA virus transmitted by mosquitoes in both sylvatic and urban cycles. CHIKV infection leads to a febrile illness, Chikungunya fever ( CHIKF ), commonly associated with more intense and debilitating outcomes. In Brazil, CHIKV arrived in 2014 through two independent introductions: the Asian/Caribbean genotype entered through the North region and the African ECSA genotype was imported through the Northeast region. Following their initial introduction, both genotypes established their urban cycle among large naive human populations, causing several outbreaks in the Americas. We sequenced CHIKV genomes from a recent outbreak in the Northeast region of Brazil, employing an in-house developed Next-Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) protocol capable of directly detecting multiple known CHIKV genotypes from clinical positive samples. Our results demonstrate that both Asian/Caribbean and ECSA genotypes expanded their ranges, reaching cocirculation in the Northeast region of Brazil. In addition, our NGS data supports the findings of simultaneous infection by these two genotypes, suggesting that coinfection might be more common than previously thought in highly endemic areas.
Horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) is a process by which bacteria acquire new genes from their environment, increasing their genetic diversity and ability to colonize new niches, including the human host. H-NS is a global modulator that targets both core genome and HGT genes, silencing gene expression in response to external stimuli. Here, we show that H-NS discriminates and differentially modulates core and HGT DNA. As an example, the plasmid R27-encoded H-NS protein selectively silences HGT genes and does not interfere with core genome regulation. In contrast, chromosomally-encoded H-NS requires a helper protein, Hha, to differentially modulate HGT and core genes. H-NS-Hha complexes silence HGT DNA, while H-NS homoligomers modulate core genes. The presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have been isolated only from members of this family. The H-NS system in enteric bacteria presents unique evolutionary features. The capacity to selectively discriminate between core and HGT DNA may help to maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent form, giving these bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, which are transmitted by sandflies and cause a range of disease phenotypes in the host. Genome sequencing of three Leishmania species, L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis, has revealed a highly conserved gene content and synteny across the genus, with only a small number of genes differentially distributed between the species. We have used customised oligonucleotide microarrays to confirm that all of the differentially distributed genes are expressed in the disease-promoting intracellular amastigotes of these species, with only a few subject to regulation at the RNA level. In the first large-scale study of gene expression in L. braziliensis, we show that only ∼9% of the genes analysed are regulated in their RNA expression during the L. braziliensis life cycle. Comparing amastigote gene expression profiles between species confirms that Leishmania transcriptomes undergo little regulation, but also identifies conserved genes that are regulated differently between species in the host. We have also investigated whether host immune competence influences parasite gene expression, by comparing RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes derived from either wild-type ( BALB/c ) or immunologically compromised ( Rag2−/− γc−/− ) mice. While parasite dissemination from the site of infection is enhanced in the Rag2−/− γc−/− genetic background, parasite RNA expression profiles are unperturbed. These findings support the hypothesis that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression at the RNA level.
Amphimeriasis, a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimerus spp., has recently been reported as endemic in the tropical Pacific side of Ecuador with a high prevalence in humans and domestic animals. The diagnosis of amphimeriasis is currently based on stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but this method lacks sensitivity and the morphology of the eggs may be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed to date. Here, we report the development and evaluation of a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification ( LAMP ) assay, named LAMPhimerus, for detecting Amphimerus sp. DNA in human stool samples. The LAMP assay was designed to target a sequence of the Amphimerus sp. internal transcribed spacer 2 region and was optimized using DNA obtained from adult worms recovered from animals. The sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assay were evaluated and found to be 76. 67% and 80. 77%, respectively, when tested with 44 human stool samples collected from localities where the fluke is endemic. The LAMP assay was shown to be highly specific for Amphimerus sp. DNA and had a detection limit of 1 pg of genomic DNA. The LAMPhimerus assay has the potential to be adapted for field diagnosis and disease surveillance in amphimeriasis-endemic areas.
Autophagosome-lysosome fusion is a critical step in autophagy, the process by which cells recycle damaged organelles and proteins. In Drosophila, the SNARE protein Syntaxin17 ( Syx17 ) forms a complex with Snap29 and Vamp7/8 to promote autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Here, we show that another SNARE protein, Ykt6, is also required for autophagosome clearance in Drosophila. We find that loss of Ykt6 leads to large-scale accumulation of autophagosomes that are unable to fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. Ykt6 localizes to lysosomes and autolysosomes and forms a SNARE complex with Syx17 and Snap29. However, Ykt6 can be outcompeted from this complex by Vamp7, and overexpression of Vamp7 rescues the fusion defect of Ykt6 loss-of-function cells. We also show that a point mutant form of Ykt6 that is thought to be important for fusion-competent SNARE complex assembly retains normal autophagic activity and restores full viability in mutant animals. These data suggest that Ykt6 acts as a non-conventional, regulatory SNARE in autophagosome-lysosome fusion and that Vamp7 is directly involved in membrane fusion.
Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae ( NTHI ), a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa, is commonly associated with opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. NTHI is able to avert the bactericidal effects of host-derived antimicrobial peptides ( AMPs ), which are a critical component of the host innate immune defense. The Sap ( sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides ) ABC transporter equips NTHI to resist AMPs, but the mechanism of this resistance has remained undefined. We previously demonstrated that the periplasmic binding protein SapA is required for NTHI virulence in vivo. Here, we show that SapA functions to directly counter AMP lethality during NTHI infection by delivering AMPs to the Sap inner membrane complex for transport into the bacterial cytoplasm. We observed that AMPs localize to the bacterial cytoplasm of the parental NTHI strain and are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptidase activity. In contrast, AMPs accumulated in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex. These data support a mechanism of Sap mediated import of AMPs, a novel strategy to reduce periplasmic and inner membrane accumulation of these host defense peptides. This is the first direct evidence that SapA contributes to bacterial virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo.
Active degradation of the multiple antibiotic resistance activator ( MarA ) in Escherichia coli controls the coordination of its downstream targets. MarA has a short half-life of 1–3 minutes due to Lon protease activity and regulates over 60 downstream targets involved in antibiotic resistance and stress response. We show that modifying MarA’s half-life either by knocking down the protease that targets it via CRISPRi or by engineering MarA to protect it from degradation impacts both the rate of coordination and the maximum coordination that downstream genes can achieve. In the context of multi-gene regulation, trade-offs between these properties show that perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist. Increasing MarA’s half-life increases the maximum coordinated diversity between downstream genes, but the rate at which the wild type and MarA fusion generate coordination between downstream genes is different. This suggests that active degradation may allow for a more responsive and agile signaling network. Alternatively, the capacity of a degraded activator to generate phenotypic diversity rapidly may be useful for a few remaining cells to regenerate diversity following antibiotic challenge.
Leishmania major is a protozoan parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis. In this study, we investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 ( MKP-2 ) in the immune response to L. major infection in C57BL/6 mice. We have previously shown that MKP-2 deficient mice are unable to control infection with Leishmania mexicana. However, in the present study, we found that MKP-2 deficient mice were able to control L. major infection with a healing response similar to wild-type mice. Despite this, we observed a reduced TH1 response in MKP-2 deficient mice with lower levels of IFN-γ and TNF-α producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and lower antigen stimulated spleen cell IFN-γ production. We also found that MKP-2 deficient macrophages were more permissive to L. major infection than wild-type macrophages due to increased Arginase-1 expression and reduced iNOS activity. However, LPS/IFN-γ activation was equally effective at controlling parasite growth in MKP-2 deficient and wild-type macrophages. Consequently, the overall TH1/TH2 balance was unaltered in MKP-2 deficient mice and no significant change in disease phenotype was observed.
The development of the ductal network in the mammalian pancreas is a poorly understood process. The pancreas is a branched organ that does not exhibit stereotypic branching patterns and contains a network of ducts that undergo a transition from unconnected microlumens to a mesh of interconnected ducts and finally to a treelike structure. Here, we show that the pancreatic network exhibits stereotypic traits at each developmental stage and changes systematically as the pancreas matures. Using in silico modeling, we deconstruct the main steps of network development into a set of simple rules likely to be conserved for many other glands. The early stage of the network is explained by noisy, redundant duct connection as new microlumens form. The later transition is attributed to pruning of the network based on the flux of fluid running through the pancreatic network into the duodenum. We show that the pancreatic ductal system has stereotypic traits at each stage and that its remodeling can be quantified by standard network measures. Our analysis reveals that although the branches of the pancreas are different between individual mice, the pancreatic network structure is stereotypic at each stage and changes systematically as the pancreas matures.
Kinesin motor proteins drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes that mediate directed movement along microtubules. Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the structural and dynamical features of the kinesin motor domain. We analyzed 114 experimental structures and the results of conventional and accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to map the structural dynamics of the kinesin motor domain. We found that all experimental structures reside in one of three distinct conformational clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like and Eg5 inhibitor-bound. These groups differ in the orientation of key functional elements, most notably the microtubule binding α4–α5, loop8 subdomain and α2b-β4-β6-β7 motor domain tip. However, group membership does not correlate with the nature of the bound nucleotide in a given structure. Instead, groupings are coincident with distinct neck-linker orientations. Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations of ATP, ADP and nucleotide free Eg5 indicate that all three nucleotide states can sample the major crystallographically observed conformations. Our results indicate that the reported ATP and ADP-like conformations of kinesin are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide state and support a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions. Furthermore, simulations highlight sites critical for large-scale conformational changes and the allosteric coupling between distal functional sites.
Bioluminescent reporter systems based on the bacterial Lux system are widely used to measure gene expression. However, the relationship between bioluminescence and gene expression is not straightforward, as bioluminescence is influenced by nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. To address this limitation, we have developed a new mathematical model that relates gene expression to light output in Lux promoter assays. The model includes newly discovered experimental evidence for product inhibition of the LuxAB reaction by FMNH2 and shows a nonlinear relationship between gene expression and light output. We have used the model to provide a method to infer gene expression from light output that can be generally applied to experiments using Lux reporter assays. The model associates changes in bioluminescence with promoter activity rather than viability, so it is important to ensure that there is minimal loss of viability due to experimental conditions in order to correctly interpret the model output. We show examples where a decrease in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a switching off of the promoter, or where an increase in bioluminescence would be better interpreted as a longer period of gene expression. This approach could benefit all users of Lux technology.
Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) and coxsackievirus A16 ( CVA16 ) are the major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease ( HFMD ) in children. The capsid binder GPP3 has been shown to inhibit the replication of these viruses. Here, we present the crystal structure of CVA16 in complex with GPP3, which reveals the key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. Based on this model, we performed in silico docking to investigate the interactions with two next-generation capsid binders, NLD and ALD, which we show to be potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with potentially interesting pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was performed using the available structural information to obtain a deeper insight into those structural features required for capsid binders to interact effectively and also those that confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity.
Necrotic is a serine proteinase inhibitor in Drosophila melanogaster that regulates the Toll-mediated immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections. Following immune-challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated which signals through the Toll receptor, resulting in the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat-body and their export to the haemolymph. Necrotic is synthesised in the fat-body, but its site of degradation has been unclear. We demonstrate that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. The serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localises with the ubiquitin-binding protein, HRS. Mutations which block late endosome/lysosome fusion cause accumulation of Necrotic-positive endosomes, even in the absence of infection. We identify the Lipophorin Receptor-1 ( LpR1 ) as an enhancer of the immune response and show that uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. In conclusion, we identify the cells and the receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster. The scavenging of serpin/proteinase complexes may be a critical step in the regulation of proteolytic cascades.
In the sea urchin larva, left–right ( LR ) asymmetry is established by opposing Nodal and BMP signals. Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side, but the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during LR axis establishment is not clear. Here, we show that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in the small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, we demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for activating the expression of the left-sided genes and the formation of the left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. Our findings show that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins, suggesting that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes.
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) lytic infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle. We show that the block to viral immediate early ( IE ) gene expression during S and G2 phases of the cell cycle can be overcome by both genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, pointing to the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways in controlling IE gene repression. Checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression strictly requires p53 and is mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53 dependent manner. Requirement for the cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) inhibitor p21 downstream of p53 suggests a pivotal role for CDKs in controlling IE gene repression in S/G2. Treatment of S/G2 cells with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine alleviates IE repression independently of p53. Importantly, CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 ( NT2 ) cells. Thus, a timely block to CDK activity not only secures phase specificity of the cell cycle dependent HCMV IE gene expression program, but in addition plays a hitherto unrecognized role in preventing the establishment of a latent-like state.
HIV-1 elite controllers ( EC ) are a small subgroup of patients who control HIV-1 replication in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. These patients are characterized by highly functional HIV-1-specific T cell responses. However, the mechanisms supporting the evolution of effective HIV-1-specific T cell immunity in these patients remain undefined. Here, we show that exposure of conventional dendritic cells ( cDCs ) from EC to HIV-1 leads to a rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of several interferon-stimulated effector genes. These cell-intrinsic immune responses are associated with a reduced induction of SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75, and an accumulation of viral reverse transcripts. Importantly, improved cell-intrinsic immune recognition of HIV-1 in cDCs from elite controllers translates into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. Our data suggest that cell-intrinsic type I interferon secretion in dendritic cells plays an important role in the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, and may be helpful for eliciting functional T cell immunity against HIV-1 for preventative or therapeutic clinical purposes.
We have developed a simple buoyancy-based screening method for identifying Drosophila larvae with increased levels of stored fat. Using this approach, we have identified 66 genes that when mutated increase organismal fat levels. Among these was a sirtuin family member, Sir2. We show that knockdown of Sir2 in the larval fat body results in increased fat levels and that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body in a cell-autonomous manner. Consistent with this function, changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes in Sir2 mutants point to a shift away from catabolism. Surprisingly, although Sir2 is typically upregulated under conditions of starvation, Sir2 mutant larvae survive better than wild type under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars are provided. Our findings point to a Sir2-mediated pathway that activates a catabolic response to amino-acid starvation irrespective of the sugar content of the diet.
Asymmetric cell division is essential for generating cellular diversity in many animal species. In this study, we investigated the evolution of mitotic spindle behavior during the first asymmetric embryonic division of nematodes. We recorded the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, which is an excellent model system to study the biophysical properties of asymmetric spindle positioning. Our collection of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis species constitutes a powerful collection of subcellular phenotypes to study the evolution of various cellular processes across species. Although all species underwent an asymmetric first cell division, they exhibited large intra- and inter-species variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and in several parameters controlling spindle movement, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed frequently during evolution with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, with the exception of spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation each evolved independently. This finding contrasts starkly with expectations based on C. elegans studies and reveals previously unrecognized evolutionary changes in spindle mechanics.
Salmonella Typhimurium ( S. Typhimurium ) and Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) have identical OmpR proteins, which are DNA binding proteins that regulate gene expression in response to environmental changes. However, despite their identical amino acid sequences, the OmpR regulons of S. Typhimurium and E. coli are largely divergent. In S. Typhimurium, OmpR expression is induced by acid pH, whereas in E. coli, it is not. This difference is due to species-specific differences in the promoter regions of the ompR genes and the EnvZ sensor kinase. The ompR gene in S. Typhimurium has an acid-inducible promoter and is positively autoregulated by EnvZ following acid shock. In contrast, the ompR gene in E. coli does not have an acid-inducible promoter and is not autoregulated by EnvZ. The OmpR regulon in S. Typhimurium overlaps with that of E. coli at only 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes, including virulence genes, that are not present in E. coli. We found that OmpR binds to its genomic targets in higher abundance when the DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S. Typhimurium as a result of acid stress and is a requirement for optimal expression of its virulence genes.
Chlamydia trachomatis, a strict intracellular pathogen, secretes a novel effector protein called NUE ( Nuclear Effector ) via a type III secretion mechanism. NUE is a histone methyltransferase that targets histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself ( automethylation ). This is the first description of a bacterial effector that directly targets mammalian histones. NUE is secreted by Chlamydia and translocates to the host cell nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. In vitro methylation assays confirmed NUE's enzymatic activity as a histone methyltransferase. Mutants deficient in automethylation demonstrated diminished activity towards histones, suggesting that automethylation functions to enhance enzymatic activity. We propose to designate CT737 and its homologs in other chlamydiae genomes as NUE, as it is the first nuclear effector identified in chlamydiae. NUE has a preference for mammalian histones over chlamydial Hc1 when used at equal concentrations. Automethylation of NUE may enhance its methyltransferase activity by increasing its affinity for target substrates.
Human height is a highly heritable complex trait, with 80%–90% of variation explained by genetic factors. Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified many common additive variants influencing height, but little attention has been given to the potential role of recessive genetic effects. Here, we investigated genome-wide recessive effects on adult height in over 35, 000 people from 21 different population samples. We found a highly significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity, equivalent to a height reduction of up to 3 cm in the offspring of first cousins compared with the offspring of unrelated individuals. This effect remained after controlling for socio-economic status, an important confounder. However, there was a high degree of heterogeneity among populations: the direction of the effect was consistent across most population samples, but the effect size differed significantly among populations. These results predict that multiple, rare, recessive variants influence human height.
Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In this study, we investigated the phenotype and function of blood monocytes ( MO ) in patients with acute uncomplicated malaria and healthy malaria-exposed individuals. We hypothesized that discrete MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity. We characterized the phenotype of blood MO by flow cytometry and evaluated MO defense function by an in vitro antibody dependent cellular inhibition ( ADCI ) assay. We found that the percentages and absolute numbers of CD16+ MO and CCR2+CX3CR1+ MO were high in a majority of patients with acute uncomplicated malaria. We also found that expression of CCR2 and CX3CR1 on the CD14high ( hi ) MO subset defined two subgroups of patients that differed significantly in their functional ability to limit parasite growth through the ADCI mechanism. Patients with the highest percentages and absolute numbers of CD14hiCCR2+CX3CR1+ MO and the highest mean levels of ADCI activity had lower blood parasitemias than patients with low numbers of CD14hiCCR2+CX3CR1+ MO. These results suggest that some patients' MO can exert a strong ADCI activity during a malaria attack and that discrete MO subpopulations are induced during malaria infection and are associated with anti-parasitic activity.
Schistosoma mansoni infection is associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible CD4 T cell subsets in the blood of HIV-uninfected Ugandan men, but not in the foreskin, according to a cross-sectional study of 34 HIV- and malaria-uninfected men who volunteered for elective circumcision. The study found that S. mansoni-infected men had a higher frequency of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in the blood compared to uninfected men. Additionally, Th17 cells in the blood of S. mansoni-infected men demonstrated enhanced function, producing multiple cytokines. However, these immune alterations were not observed in the foreskin tissue of S. mansoni-infected men. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection is associated with an increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible T cell subsets in the blood, but these immune changes do not extend to the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual Ugandan men.
Filarial nematodes, the causative agents of filarial diseases, maintain a mutualistic relationship with the endosymbiont Wolbachia. Depletion of Wolbachia has been shown to produce profound defects in nematode development, fertility, and viability, making it a promising approach for treating filarial diseases. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Wolbachia from filarial nematodes leads to extensive apoptosis in adult germline cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae ( L4 ). Using whole mount confocal microscopy, we show that apoptosis occurs in the majority of embryonic cells that had not been infected with Wolbachia prior to antibiotic treatment, suggesting that the effects of Wolbachia depletion on apoptosis are non-cell autonomous. The pattern of apoptosis correlates closely with the nematode tissues and processes initially perturbed following depletion of Wolbachia, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization, which are sustained for several months until the premature death of the adult worms. Our observations provide a cellular mechanism to account for the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occurs prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes.
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria, requires extracellular pantothenate to proliferate during the blood stage of its life cycle. Pantothenate is converted into coenzyme A ( CoA ) via a series of five enzymes, with pantothenate kinase ( PfPanK ) being the first enzyme in this pathway. Antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, such as pantothenol and CJ-15, 801, have been shown to kill the parasite by targeting CoA biosynthesis or utilisation. However, the exact mechanism of action of these analogues has not been elucidated. Here, we show that continuous drug-pressuring with pantothenol or CJ-15, 801 selects for mutations in one of the two putative PanK genes of P. falciparum, Pfpank1. These mutations significantly alter PfPanK activity, with some conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pfpank1 coding for a functional PanK that is essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibit a different sensitivity profile to recently-described antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. We provide evidence consistent with different pantothenate analogue classes having different mechanisms of action: some inhibit CoA biosynthesis while others inhibit CoA-utilising enzymes.
Genome-wide association ( GWA ) studies were performed to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time, in African American individuals from four cohorts ( n = 6, 247 ). Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6. 0 microarray, and imputation was performed for 2. 8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) using combined YRI and CEU HapMap phase II panels. We observed a genome-wide significant association ( p<2. 5×10−8 ) between the PR interval and a SNP ( rs3922844 ) within the gene encoding the cardiac sodium channel ( SCN5A ) in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans ( beta = 5. 1 msec per minor allele, 95% CI = 4. 1–6. 1, p = 3×10−23 ). This SNP was also associated with PR interval in individuals of European ancestry ( n = 14, 042 ), but with a smaller effect size ( p for heterogeneity <0. 001 ) and variability explained ( 0. 5% ). Further meta-analysis of the four cohorts identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A ( rs6798015 ), MEIS1 ( rs10865355 ), and TBX5 ( rs7312625 ) that were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian GWA studies.
Tomato mosaic virus ( ToMV ) is a positive-strand RNA virus that replicates its genomic RNA in replication complexes formed on intracellular membranes. Previous studies have shown that a host seven-pass transmembrane protein TOM1 is necessary for efficient ToMV multiplication. In this study, we show that a small GTP-binding protein ARL8, along with TOM1, is co-purified with the ToMV 180K replication protein from solubilized membranes of ToMV-infected tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ) cells. This suggests that a complex containing ToMV replication proteins, TOM1, and ARL8 is formed on membranes in infected cells. In Arabidopsis thaliana, ARL8 consists of four family members, and simultaneous mutations in two specific ARL8 genes completely inhibited tobamovirus multiplication. In an in vitro ToMV RNA translation-replication system, the lack of either TOM1 or ARL8 proteins inhibited the production of replicative-form RNA, indicating that TOM1 and ARL8 are required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis.
In the locust olfactory system, two types of inhibitory motifs, feed-forward ( FF ) and feedback ( FB ) inhibition, have been proposed to shape the firing patterns of Kenyon cells ( KCs ) in the mushroom body ( MB ). FF inhibition was previously thought to be mediated by a population of inhibitory cells in the lateral horn ( LH ), while FB inhibition is mediated by a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron ( GGN ). We developed two models of the locust olfactory system to compare the properties of FF and FB inhibition. We found that both inhibitory motifs were able to maintain sparse KC responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition was able to create a phase response consistent with data recorded in vivo. Our results suggest that GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs. We also found that GGN-mediated inhibition affects both KCs and lateral horn interneurons ( LHNs ), although both classes of neurons respond differently to odor presentations. Our findings describe general rules for FF versus FB inhibition and provide a better understanding of how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity. This knowledge could be used to reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks.
The definitive diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies, is based on laboratory confirmation. Molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) based methods, are increasingly used for diagnosing rabies in humans and for epidemiological analyses. However, it remains a key challenge to obtain relevant specificity and sensitivity with these techniques while ensuring that the genetic diversity of lyssaviruses does not compromise detection. We developed a dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( combo RT-qPCR ) method for pan-lyssavirus detection. This method is based on two complementary technologies: a probe-based ( TaqMan ) RT-qPCR for detecting the RABV species ( pan-RABV RT-qPCR ) and a second reaction using an intercalating dye ( SYBR Green ) to detect other lyssavirus species ( pan-lyssa RT-qPCR ). The performance parameters of this combined assay were evaluated with a large panel of primary animal samples covering almost all the genetic variability encountered at the viral species level, and they extended to almost all lyssavirus species characterized to date. This method was also evaluated for the diagnosis of human rabies on 211 biological samples ( positive n = 76 and negative n = 135 ) including saliva, skin and brain biopsies. It detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested and confirmed the sensitivity and the interest of skin biopsy ( 91. 5% ) and saliva ( 54% ) samples for intra-vitam diagnosis of human rabies. Finally, this method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries ( Cambodia and Morocco ).
Trypanosomiasis, a disease transmitted by tsetse flies, resulted in more than 50% losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana in 2007. A control trial was conducted from May 2007 to October 2007 to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets to control tsetse flies and subsequently reduce the risk of trypanosomiasis in pigs. Two villages were selected, one serving as a control and the other as an experimental village where 24 pigsties were protected with insecticide-treated mosquito nets. The nets were 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester fences with 100 mg/m2 deltamethrin and a UV protector attached to timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring of tsetse fly densities showed a reduction of more than 90% in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. In contrast, the tsetse fly population in the control village was not affected, only displaying seasonal variations. The trypanosome prevalence in pigs was also significantly reduced in the protected village, decreasing from 76% to 8% after six months, compared to 60% in the control village.
Reproducibility and transparency in the biomedical literature are major concerns in the scientific community. In this study, we assessed the current status of reproducibility and transparency in a random sample of 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014. Only one study provided a full protocol and none made all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare ( n = 4 ), and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. However, the percentage of articles with no statement of conflict decreased substantially between 2000 and 2014 ( 94. 4% in 2000 to 34. 6% in 2014 ), while the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts ( 0% in 2000, 15. 4% in 2014 ) or no conflicts ( 5. 6% in 2000, 50. 0% in 2014 ) increased. Articles published in journals in the clinical medicine category were almost twice as likely to not include any information on funding and to have private funding.
Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of primary pneumonic plague, targets alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in the lung during the pre-inflammatory phase of the disease. Using a FRET-based probe, we show that Y. pestis targets alveolar macrophages early during infection of mice, followed by a switch in host cell preference to neutrophils. We also demonstrate that neutrophil influx is unable to limit bacterial growth in the lung and is ultimately responsible for the severe inflammation during the lethal pro-inflammatory phase. The ability of Y. pestis to create a localized protective environment in the lung early during pneumonic plague suggests that it deactivates host innate immune responses. Depletion of roughly 92% of alveolar macrophages had little or no effect on bacterial burden in the lung, indicating that macrophages are not involved in limiting Yersinia survival in the lung. We show that the Y. pestis type III secretion system primarily targets macrophages and neutrophils early during the pre-inflammatory phase of disease.
Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ), caused by Leishmania ( Leishmania ) infantum in Brazil, is difficult to diagnose in asymptomatic carriers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of serology to identify asymptomatic VL infection in a cohort of 136 participants from an urban area in the Southeast of Brazil. Blood samples were collected in 2001 and tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) using three different antigens: L. infantum and L. amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. Molecular biology techniques ( PCR with Leishmania-generic primer followed by hybridization using L. infantum probe, and PCR with specific primer to L. donovani complex ) were used as reference tests. The presence of Leishmania was confirmed in all kala-azar patients and in 117 ( 86% ) of the cohort participants. Kala-azar patients showed high reactivity in ELISAs, whereas asymptomatic individuals presented low reactivity against the antigens tested. The rK39 antigen showed higher specificity ( 73. 7% ) than L. amazonensis ( 52. 6% ) and L. infantum antigens ( 36. 8% ), but lower sensitivity ( 26. 5% ) than L. amazonensis ( 49. 6% ) and L. infantum ( 41. 0% ). There was low agreement among the different antigens used ( kappa<0. 10 ). Serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, which could lead to misclassification bias in population studies.
Retrotransposons are highly abundant in mammalian genomes and can amplify in pluripotent cells or developing germ cells. However, the mechanisms that silence retrotransposons in germ cells and pluripotent cells are not well understood. Here, we show that cryptic repetitive element probes present in Illumina and Affymetrix gene expression microarray platforms can be used to monitor retrotransposon expression. This computational approach has allowed us to identify the histone deacetylase Hdac1 as a component of the retrotransposon silencing machinery in mouse embryonic stem cells, and to determine the retrotransposon targets of Hdac1 in these cells. We have also identified retrotransposons that are targets of other silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, Eset-mediated histone modification, and Ring1B/Eed-containing polycomb repressive complexes in mouse embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells, and that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms.
Cryptochrome 2 ( CRY2 ) mediates light control of flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. CRY2 interacts with CRY2-interacting bHLH 1 ( CIB1 ) in response to blue light to activate the transcription of Flowering Locus T ( FT ). In vitro, CIB1 binds to the canonical E-box ( CACGTG ) with much higher affinity than to non-canonical E-box ( CANNTG ) DNA sequences. However, in vivo, CIB1 binds to the chromatin region of the FT promoter, which only contains non-canonical E-box sequences. We show that CRY2 also interacts with at least CIB5 in response to blue light, but not in darkness or in response to other wavelengths of light. CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 act redundantly to activate the transcription of FT and are positive regulators of CRY2-mediated flowering. CIB1 and other CIB proteins form heterodimers, and some of the heterodimers have a higher binding affinity than the CIB homodimers to the non-canonical E-box in vitro. This explains why CIB1 and other CIBs bind to the canonical E-box with a higher affinity in vitro, whereas they are associated with the non-canonical E-boxes at the FT promoter in vivo.
Intestinal parasites such as hookworm, Trichuris trichuria, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis are rare in the United States but common in countries from which U. S. -bound refugees travel. These infections may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading to potentially serious consequences. We evaluated the costs and benefits of overseas presumptive treatment of parasitic diseases vs. domestic screening/treating vs. no program for an annual cohort of 27, 700 U. S. -bound Asian refugees. We developed an economic decision tree model terminating in Markov processes to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions: 1 ) “No Program, ” 2 ) U. S. “Domestic Screening and Treatment, ” 3 ) “Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin” presumptive treatment, and 4 ) “Overseas Albendazole and Domestic Screening for Strongyloides”. According to the model outcomes, the most effective treatment option is “Overseas Albendazole and Ivermectin, ” which reduces outpatient cases, deaths and hospitalization by around 80% at an estimated net cost of $458, 718 per death averted, or $2, 219/$24, 036 per QALY/life year gained relative to “No Program”. Overseas presumptive treatment for U. S. -bound refugees is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole reduces the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the probability of rare, but potentially fatal, disseminated strongyloidiasis.
Nematocida displodere is a new species of microsporidian parasite that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike other microsporidian parasites of C. elegans, N. displodere has a broad tissue tropism and can infect and replicate in multiple host tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, intestine, coelomocytes, and seam cells. This is in contrast to Nematocida parisii and Nematocida sp. 1, which exclusively infect and replicate in the intestine. N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus and has over 10% of its proteins encoded by a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins of unknown function. These proteins may mediate interactions with the host. N. displodere infection is dependent on C. elegans feeding and is consistent with other invertebrate-infecting microsporidia that display two major pathways for infection, either through ingestion of spores or transovum/transovarial passage. N. displodere is the first pathogen with the capacity to infect the neurons, muscle, or coelomocytes of C. elegans. The discovery and characterization of N. displodere presents a unique model system in C. elegans to study the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of pathogen tissue tropism.
The Cockayne syndrome complementation group B ( CSB ) protein is a member of the SWI2/SNF2 ATP–dependent chromatin remodeler family and is essential for transcription-coupled DNA repair. Mutations in CSB are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease characterized by premature aging, sun sensitivity, and neurological and developmental defects. Here, we show that CSB repositions nucleosomes in an ATP–dependent manner in vitro and that this activity is greatly enhanced by the NAP1-like histone chaperones, which we identify as new CSB–binding partners. By mapping functional domains and analyzing CSB derivatives, we demonstrate that chromatin remodeling by the combined activities of CSB and the NAP1-like chaperones is required for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. Moreover, we show that chromatin remodeling and repair protein recruitment mediated by CSB are separable activities. The collaboration between CSB and the NAP1-like histone chaperones adds a new dimension to our understanding of the ways in which ATP–dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones can regulate chromatin structure.
Epigenetic variation in the form of DNA methylation has been mapped in five purified human cell types, revealing hundreds of genomic loci with high inter-individual variation. These loci, termed Variably Methylated Regions ( VMRs ), are enriched for functional genomic features such as enhancers and 3’ UTRs. While most VMRs have high heritability, a subset shows highly correlated variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks with low heritability that differ between cell types. These networks are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs is enriched for genes involved in T-cell activation, while in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-regulated VMRs comprises all four HOX gene clusters and is enriched for control of tissue growth. In neurons, a network of 18 VMRs is enriched for roles in synaptic signaling. We experimentally demonstrated that some VMR networks are responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels at these loci changing in a coordinated fashion in trans. These environmentally-responsive VMRs are enriched for imprinted loci, suggesting that they are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages of infection. Serological tests for IgM and IgG are commonly used in clinical laboratories to diagnose dengue and differentiate between primary and secondary infections. However, these tests can be less sensitive in the early stages of infection. Dengue virus non-structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) has been identified as an early marker for acute dengue and is typically present between days 1–9 post-onset of illness. We evaluated the performance of a newly developed Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for NS1 in combination with a commercial IgM/IgG rapid test to determine if it can improve diagnostic sensitivity. The test was evaluated in a retrospective study in Vietnam with 198 acute laboratory-confirmed positive and 100 negative samples, and in Malaysia with 263 laboratory-confirmed positive and 30 negative samples. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 69. 2% and 96% respectively in Vietnam, and 68. 9% and 96. 7% respectively in Malaysia. Importantly, when the Dengue Early Rapid test was used in combination with the IgM/IgG test, the sensitivity increased to 93. 0%. This study highlights that using dengue NS1 antigen detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein E IgM and IgG serology can significantly increase the sensitivity of acute dengue diagnosis and extends the possible window of detection to include very early acute samples.
Transat is a new computational method for detecting the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted, and alternative structures. Unlike existing RNA structure prediction methods, which assume a unique functional RNA structure and do not predict functional features required for in vivo folding, Transat detects conserved helices of high statistical significance. We have evaluated the performance of Transat and shown that it is able to predict the structural features of known reference structures, including pseudo-knotted ones, as well as those of known alternative structural configurations. Transat can also identify unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provides evidence for new helices which may define folding pathways. This supports the notion that homologous RNA sequences not only assume a similar reference RNA structure, but also fold similarly in vivo. Unlike existing methods for predicting folding pathways, Transat works in a comparative way, highlighting conserved features and not requiring a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment.
Plant immunity in Arabidopsis is mediated by a highly buffered biological network that controls inducible immunity. This network is comprised of four sub-networks: the salicylate ( SA ), jasmonate ( JA ), ethylene ( ET ), and phytoalexin-deficient 4 ( PAD4 ) signaling sectors. These sectors interact with one another to compensate for loss of function in individual components, conferring resilience against pathogen effectors that target and disable plant immune signaling proteins. Through a network reconstitution strategy, we have resolved systems-level regulatory mechanisms underlying the Arabidopsis transcriptome response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 ( flg22 ). These mechanisms show widespread evidence of interactions among major sub-networks in the flg22-responsive transcriptome. Many of these interactions result in network buffering, which conceals the identity of network components. We demonstrate that many of the regulatory mechanisms we resolved are not detectable by the traditional genetic approach of single-gene null-mutant analysis. Similar to potential pathogenic perturbations, null-mutant effects on immune signaling can be buffered by the network. Our work shows that high-order perturbation at the scale of signaling sectors and dynamic transcriptional profiling together can help in deciphering the regulation of a complex network, the plant immune signaling network.
Neuroepithelial patterning is a critical step in the development of the central nervous system. In Drosophila, neuroepithelial patterning of the embryonic optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primordium and the optic lobe primordium. We have identified a genetic network that regulates the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, as well as between primary and secondary photoreceptor ( PR ) precursors. The proneural factor Atonal ( Ato ) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless ( Tll ) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. Notch signaling also controls a binary cell fate decision, thus acting at the top of a cascade of transcription factor interactions to define PR subtype identity.
Human ß-defensin 1 ( hBD1 ) is a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide that exhibits distinct antimicrobial activities depending on its redox state. Here, we show that the reduced form of hBD1 ( hBD1red ) forms a net-like structure that entraps bacteria and prevents their transmigration, independent of bacterial killing. In contrast, the oxidized form of hBD1 ( hBD1ox ) does not form such a structure. Using electron microscopy, we detected a net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with hBD1red, but not with hBD1ox. A transmigration assay demonstrated that hBD1-derived nets capture bacteria and inhibit their transmigration, independent of bacterial killing. These nets are stable in the presence of human duodenal secretion with a high amount of proteases and can completely prevent migration of hBD1-resistant pathogens. In contrast to other defensins, such as Paneth cell-derived human α-defensin 6 ( HD6 ), cysteins are necessary for net formation by hBD1red. This redox-dependent function serves as an additional mechanism of action for hBD1 and differs from net formation by other defensins. While hBD1red and hBD1ox have distinct antimicrobial profiles and functions, only the reduced form provides additional host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures preventing bacterial invasion.
Deficiency of the Lowe syndrome protein OCRL1 causes a defect in endocytosis in the zebrafish pronephric tubule, a model for the mammalian renal tubule. This coincides with a reduction in levels of the scavenger receptor megalin and its accumulation in endocytic compartments, consistent with reduced recycling within the endocytic pathway. We also observe reduced numbers of early endocytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the sub-apical region of pronephric cells. Cell polarity within the pronephric tubule is unaffected in mutant embryos. The OCRL1-deficient embryos exhibit a mild ciliogenesis defect, but this cannot account for the observed impairment of endocytosis. Catalytic activity of OCRL1 is required for renal tubular endocytosis and the endocytic defect can be rescued by suppression of PIP5K. These results indicate that OCRL1 is required for endocytic trafficking in vivo, and strongly support the hypothesis that endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. Moreover, our results reveal PIP5K as a potential therapeutic target for Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease.
Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis that affects both livestock and wild ruminants. The disease is known to occur in cycles of 5–15 years in the Eastern Africa region and the Horn of Africa, following unusual high precipitations that lead to sustained flooding. In recent years, evidence of RVF transmission during the inter-epidemic periods in some parts of the African continent has increasingly been reported. We investigated the presence of and the determinants for inter-epidemic RVF transmission in an area experiencing annual flooding in southern Tanzania. A cross-sectional sero-survey was conducted in randomly selected cattle, sheep and goats in the Kilombero river valley from May to August 2011, approximately four years after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak in Tanzania. An overall seroprevalence of 11. 3% ( n = 1680 ) was recorded; 5. 5% in animals born after the 2006/07 RVF outbreak and 22. 7% in animals present during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts. The spatial distribution of seroprevalence exhibited a few hotspots. Animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living <5 km ( OR 1. 92; 95% CI 1. 04–3. 56 ). These findings indicate post-epidemic transmission of RVFV in the study area. The linear increase in seroprevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts implies a constant exposure and presence of active foci transmission preceding the survey.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, possesses a contractile vacuole complex ( CVC ) that plays a role in osmoregulation. In addition to its role in osmoregulation, the CVC is also involved in the trafficking of glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) -anchored proteins to the plasma membrane of the parasite. Here, we show that T. cruzi Rab11 ( TcRab11 ) regulates the trafficking of GPI-anchored trans-sialidase ( TcTS ) to the plasma membrane through the CVC. TcTS is an abundant GPI-anchored protein present in the cell surface of trypomastigotes, where it catalyzes the transfer of sialic acid from host proteins to parasite mucins. We found that TcRab11 localizes to the CVC and that a dominant negative mutant of TcRab11 prevents TcTS from reaching the plasma membrane, resulting in reduced infectivity of the parasite. We also found that TcTS is trafficked to the plasma membrane of T. cruzi by an unconventional pathway involving the CVC and that the CVC is enriched in lipid rafts. Expression of the dominant negative form of TcRab11 makes epimastigotes less responsive to hyposmotic and hyperosmotic stresses.
Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) regimens were compared in a phase III clinical trial to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine ( PCECV ) administered according to a 4-site/1-week intradermal ( ID ) regimen versus the currently recommended 2-site/Thai Red Cross ( TRC ) regimen. A total of 443 participants received the 4-site/1-week regimen and 442 participants received the 2-site/TRC regimen. All participants achieved adequate rabies virus neutralizing antibody ( RVNA ) concentrations by day ( D ) 14. At D49, the percentage of participants with adequate RVNA concentrations was non-inferior in the 4-site/1-week group compared to the 2-site/TRC group, with a difference of -1% ( 95% confidence interval: -2. 4–0. 0 ). The 4-site/1-week regimen had similar safety profiles to the 2-site/TRC regimen, with no vaccination-related serious adverse events reported. The elicited immune responses peaked at D14 and subsequently declined up to D365. RVNA concentrations were consistently lower in participants with concomitant human rabies immunoglobulin ( HRIG ) administration compared to those without. The results suggest that the 4-site/1-week regimen might be an alternative to current recommendations, with potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination.
The salience network ( SN ) plays a crucial role in the human brain's ability to detect and attend to goal-relevant events in a flexible manner. We investigated the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the SN using high temporal-resolution fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and novel graph-theoretical techniques. We found that the SN is characterized by several distinctive and robust properties, including the highest levels of flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other brain networks, such as the frontoparietal network ( FPN ), the cingulate–opercular network ( CON ), and the ventral and dorsal attention networks ( VAN and DAN ). We also found that dynamic functional interactions of the SN were among the most spatially varied in the brain, and that SN nodes maintained a consistently high level of network centrality over time, indicating that this network is a hub for facilitating flexible cross-network interactions. Importantly, time-varying connectivity profiles of the SN were distinct from all other prefrontal control systems, and temporal flexibility of the SN uniquely predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These results were also observed in a second retest dataset, demonstrating the robustness of our findings.
The SV40 virus is a nonenveloped virus that must be released from the host cell without being encapsulated by cellular membranes. This process is poorly understood and involves the insertion of viral proteins into host cellular membranes to render them permeable to large molecules. VP4 is a newly identified SV40 gene product that is expressed at late times during the viral life cycle, corresponding to the time of cell lysis. We investigated the role of VP4 in viral release by expressing and purifying it as a GST fusion protein from bacteria. Purified VP4 was found to efficiently bind biological membranes and support their disruption. VP4 perforated membranes by directly interacting with the membrane bilayer as demonstrated by flotation assays and the release of fluorescent markers encapsulated into large unilamellar vesicles or liposomes. The central hydrophobic domain of VP4 was essential for membrane binding and disruption. VP4 displayed a preference for membranes comprised of lipids that replicated the composition of the plasma membranes over that of nuclear membranes. Phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid found at high levels in bacterial membranes, was inhibitory against the membrane perforation activity of VP4. The disruption of membranes by VP4 involved the formation of pores of ∼3 nm inner diameter in mammalian cells including permissive SV40 host cells. Altogether, these results support a central role of VP4 acting as a viroporin in the perforation of cellular membranes to trigger SV40 viral release.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, with an estimated half of the world's population at risk of infection. The immune response against DENV is not yet fully understood and a better knowledge of it is now recognized as one of the main challenges for vaccine development. We previously reported that a DNA vaccine containing the DENV2 NS1 gene ( pcTPANS1 ) induced protection against dengue in mice. Here, we aimed to elucidate the contribution of cellular and humoral responses elicited by this vaccine candidate for protective immunity. We observed that pcTPANS1 induced considerable levels of anti-NS1 antibodies and T cell responses. Passive immunization with anti-NS1 antibodies conferred partial protection in mice infected with low virus load, which was abrogated with the increase of viral dose. pcTPANS1 also induced activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We detected production of IFN-γ and a cytotoxic activity by CD8+ T lymphocytes induced by this vaccine, although its contribution in the protection was not so evident when compared to CD4+ cells. Depletion of CD4+ cells in immunized mice completely abolished protection. Furthermore, transfer experiments revealed that animals receiving CD4+ T cells combined with anti-NS1 antiserum, both obtained from vaccinated mice, survived virus infection with survival rates not significantly different from pcTPANS1-immunized animals.
Streptococcal cell-to-cell communication mainly relies on extracellular signaling peptides that elicit a response either indirectly by triggering a two-component phosphorelay or directly by binding to cytoplasmic effectors. The RNPP family of proteins, which includes Rgg, Rap, NprR, PrgX, and PlcR, regulates important bacterial processes such as sporulation, conjugation, and virulence. Here, we elucidate the structure-function relationship of ComR, a new member of the RNPP family, which positively controls competence for natural DNA transformation in streptococci. ComR is directly activated by the binding of its associated pheromone XIP, the mature form of the comX/sigX-inducing-peptide ComS. The crystal structure analysis of ComR from Streptococcus thermophilus combined with mutational analysis and in vivo assays reveals that XIP-binding induces release of the sequestered HTH domain and ComR dimerization to allow DNA binding. Importantly, we bring evidence that this activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, demonstrating that ComR is not an Rgg protein as initially proposed, but instead constitutes a new member of the RNPP family. The identification of XIP and ComR residues important for competence activation constitutes a crucial step towards the design of antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptococci.
Ligand activation of the prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC has been investigated by electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines that include the neurotransmitter GABA at high micro- to millimolar concentrations. The ligands bind to a conserved site and evoke currents that slowly desensitize over time. The protein forms cation selective channels with properties that resemble the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The high single channel conductance and the comparably simple functional behavior make ELIC an attractive model system to study general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in this important family of neurotransmitter receptors. ELIC is activated by a set of primary amines that include alkylamines, aminothiols, aminoalcohols, bromoamines, diamines, and the neurotransmitter GABA. The pentameric ligand-gated ion channels ( pLGICs ) constitute a large family of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in the animal kingdom. All family members share a conserved molecular architecture and a similar functional behavior. With known agonists, ELIC has now become amenable for detailed structural and functional investigations.
Skin-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP ) has been identified as the systemic driver of the progression from eczema/atopic dermatitis ( AD ) to asthma. We show that mice with skin-barrier defects develop AD-like skin inflammation and are susceptible to allergic asthma, similar to humans with AD. TSLP, overexpressed by skin keratinocytes, is the systemic driver of this bronchial hyper-responsiveness. In mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of RBP-j that sustained high systemic levels of TSLP, antigen-induced allergic challenge to the lung airways resulted in a severe asthmatic phenotype not seen in similarly treated wild-type littermates. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the atopic march, demonstrating that high serum TSLP levels were required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. Importantly, we show that epidermal-derived TSLP was sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing the lung airways to inhaled allergens in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization. These findings suggest that in addition to early treatment of the primary skin-barrier defects, selective inhibition of systemic TSLP may be the key to blocking the development of asthma in AD patients.
The genome of Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium, has been characterized using a multi-omics approach that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data with bioinformatics tools. This approach revealed several distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome relative to other bacteria. The T. maritima genome has a high number of genes per transcription unit ( 3. 3 ), a low number of putative non-coding RNAs ( 12 ), and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites ( 3. 7% ). The promoters and ribosome binding sites of T. maritima are highly conserved relative to other bacteria. The 5′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ) of T. maritima follow an atypical bimodal length distribution, consisting of “Short” 5′UTRs ( 11–17 nt ) and “Common” 5′UTRs ( 26–32 nt ). Transcriptional regulation in T. maritima is limited by a lack of intergenic space for the majority of transcription units. Furthermore, a high fraction of annotated genes in T. maritima are expressed independently of growth state, and there is a linear correlation between mRNA and protein abundance ( Pearson r = 0. 63, p<2. 2×10−16 t-test ).
Visual object recognition and sensitivity to image features are largely influenced by contextual inputs. We study the influence of contextual bars on the bias to perceive or infer the presence of a target bar, rather than on the sensitivity to image features. Human observers judged whether a target bar of a known orientation and shape is present at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without a context of other bars. Observers are more likely to perceive a target when the context has a weaker rather than stronger contrast. When the context can perceptually group well with the would-be target, weak contrast contextual bars bias the observers to perceive a target relative to the condition without contexts, as if to fill in the target. Meanwhile, high-contrast contextual bars, regardless of whether they group well with the target, bias the observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference is shown to account for the data well, illustrating that the context influences the perception in two ways: ( 1 ) biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual grouping principles, and ( 2 ) biasing observers' internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. According to this model, our data suggest that the context does not influence the perceived target contrast despite its influence on the bias to perceive the target's presence, thereby suggesting that cortical areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for the visual inferences.
Defectors can sometimes create conditions that rescue cooperation from defector-induced destruction. This is counterintuitive because cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors, which enjoy a fitness advantage by consuming the common good without contributing fairly. However, in a structured population, defectors can increase the heterogeneity in population collapse dynamics, reducing the chances that all populations go extinct simultaneously. When defectors are initially present, they occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperator-only but not defector-only populations to grow. Additionally, defectors cause population extinction, which creates empty locations that support cooperator but not defector migrants. This leads to the counterintuitive result that the initial presence of defectors in a population can sometimes improve the survival of cooperators. Furthermore, resource limitation, which can be precipitated by defectors, selects for rare cooperator and defector mutants adapted to this resource limitation. When these mutants are initially present at low levels or continuously generated at a moderate rate, they can favor cooperation by further reducing local population size. We predict that in a structured population, small population sizes precipitated by defectors provide a “built-in” mechanism for the persistence of cooperation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes infections only in patients with altered epithelial barriers. In this study, we show that P. aeruginosa adheres almost exclusively to sites of multi-cellular junctions in a polarized epithelium, where it binds to extruded apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies. This dead cell tropism is independent of the type of cell death, as P. aeruginosa also binds to necrotic cells. We further show that P. aeruginosa is internalized through efferocytosis, a process in which surrounding epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Intracellularly, along with apoptotic cell debris, P. aeruginosa inhabits an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is finally killed. We propose that elimination of P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis is part of a host defense mechanism. Our findings could be relevant for the study of cystic fibrosis, which is characterized by an exacerbated number of apoptotic cells and ineffective efferocytosis.
During Drosophila embryonic development, primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) and somatic gonadal precursor cells ( SGPs ) assemble to form the embryonic gonad. PGCs must migrate through the mesoderm to reach the SGPs, a process guided by local repulsive cues and attractive signals from the SGPs. We investigated the role of the hedgehog ( hh ) pathway gene shifted ( shf ) in directing PGC migration. shf encodes a secreted protein that facilitates long distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix. shf is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm and is required for PGC migration, as demonstrated by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. The hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway plays a crucial role in generating the PGC attractant produced by the SGPs and other tissues. We show that production of this attractant depends on shf as well as the hh pathway gene gγ1. Ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release/transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where Hh can contact migrating PGCs. Potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend on cholesterol modification.
Recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) HIV-1 vaccine primes HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells for modest cytotoxic capacity that is most pronounced in individuals carrying protective HLA class I alleles. In this study, we examined the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in response to primary autologous HIV-infected CD4+ T-cell targets in samples from HIV-negative individuals vaccinated with a replication-incompetent Ad5/HIV vaccine. We observed readily detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell recall cytotoxic responses in vaccinees at a median of 331 days following the last immunization. The magnitude of these responses was not related to the number of vaccinations, nor did it correlate with the percentages of cytokine-secreting T-cells determined by ICS assays. Although the recall cytotoxic capacity of the CD8+ T-cells of the vaccinee group was significantly less than that of long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) and overlapped with that of progressors, we observed significantly higher cytotoxic responses in vaccine recipients carrying the HLA class I alleles B*27, B*57 or B*58, which have been associated with immune control over HIV replication in chronic infection. These findings suggest that protective HLA class I alleles might lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and following immunization due to more efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses.
The evolution of modern human cognition is hypothesized to have been catalyzed by the development of jointly intentional modes of behavior. This is known as the shared intentionality hypothesis, which suggests that a high degree of collaborative behavior amongst early hominins relative to other great apes aided the development of the rich cognitive abilities found in modern humans. Here, we formally model the coevolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, showing that rapid techno-cultural advance goes hand in hand with the emergence of the ability to participate in jointly intentional behavior. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant techno-cultural improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. We provide a unified mechanism for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior. The emergence of shared intentions at a time of significant technological advance is consistent with evidence that composite tool manufacture may have evolved roughly contemporaneously with grammatical language, the primary application of which is the facilitation of jointly intentional behavior.
Oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, the leading cause of male sub/infertility in humans, is characterized by low sperm count, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. We found that the miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci, members of the miR-34 family, are specifically and highly expressed in post-mitotic male germ cells and play a critical role in spermatogenesis. Deletion of both miR-34b/c and miR-449 loci in mice resulted in oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, characterized by low sperm count, aberrant sperm morphology, and poor sperm motility. Our results indicate that miR-34bc/449-deficiency impairs both meiosis and the final stages of spermatozoa maturation. Analysis of miR-34bc−/−;449−/− pachytene spermatocytes revealed a small cohort of genes deregulated that were highly enriched for miR-34 family target genes. Our study identifies the miR-34 family as the first functionally important miRNAs for spermatogenesis whose deregulation is causal to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility.
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 ( EcN ) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain unknown. EcN produces two siderophore-microcins ( Mcc ) and the genotoxin colibactin encoded by the pks island. Colibactin is a virulence factor and a putative pro-carcinogenic compound. We aimed to decouple the antagonistic activity of EcN from its genotoxic activity. We demonstrated that ClbP, the peptidase that activates colibactin, is required for the antagonistic activity of EcN. The analysis of ClbP mutants revealed that this activity is linked to the transmembrane helices of ClbP and not the periplasmic peptidase domain. A single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivates the genotoxic activity but maintains the antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonellosis model, this point mutant reduced the clinical signs and the fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild type strain. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in vitro with other E. coli strains that carry both a truncated form of the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. This interplay between colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways suggests that these genomic islands were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity by specifically inactivating ClbP peptidase domain opens the way to the safe use of EcN.
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. It is the leading cause of fungal meningitis worldwide. Cryptococcal glycans are required for fungal survival in the host and for pathogenesis. These glycans are made in the secretory pathway, although the activated precursors for their synthesis, nucleotide sugars, are made primarily in the cytosol. Nucleotide sugar transporters ( NSTs ) are membrane proteins that exchange nucleotide sugars for the corresponding nucleoside phosphates. The major virulence factor of C. neoformans is an anti-phagocytic polysaccharide capsule that is displayed on the cell surface; capsule polysaccharides are also shed from the cell and impede the host immune response. Here we show that Uxt1 and Uxt2 are both transporters specific for the xylose donor, UDP-xylose, although they exhibit distinct subcellular localization, expression patterns, and kinetic parameters. Both proteins also transport the galactofuranose donor, UDP-galactofuranose. We further show that Uxt1 and Uxt2 are required for xylose incorporation into capsule and protein; they are also necessary for C. neoformans to cause disease in mice, although surprisingly not for fungal viability in the context of infection. These findings provide a starting point for deciphering the substrate specificity of an important class of transporters, elucidate a synthetic pathway that may be productively targeted for therapy, and contribute to our understanding of fundamental glycobiology.
Neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) are a major public health burden in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Disease risk estimates are a key feature to target control interventions and serve as a benchmark for monitoring and evaluation. However, a georeferenced global database for NTDs providing open-access to the available survey data is currently missing. We describe the development of such a database that can be employed for spatial disease risk modeling and control of NTDs. We systematically searched the literature and contacted Ministries of Health and research institutions in schistosomiasis-endemic countries for location-specific prevalence data and survey details. The data were extracted, georeferenced, and stored in a MySQL database with a web interface allowing free database access and data management. At the beginning of 2011, our database contained more than 12, 000 georeferenced schistosomiasis survey locations from 35 African countries. The database is currently expanded to a global repository, including a host of other NTDs, e. g. soil-transmitted helminthiasis and leishmaniasis. An open-access, spatially explicit NTD database offers unique opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, disease monitoring, and surveillance.
Chronic helminth infection does not exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) infection in cotton rats, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis and an excellent model for human MTB infection. We hypothesized that chronic helminth infections may worsen the course of MTB by inducing a Th2 immune shift and establishing an immunoregulatory milieu that suppresses Th1 immunity, which is necessary for MTB control. However, the results of this study demonstrate that chronic filarial infection does not alter control of MTB in cotton rats. Histological examinations and quantitative MTB cultures from two independent experiments clearly demonstrated equivalent or reduced mycobacterial burden in co-infected animals compared to those infected with only MTB. In contrast to our hypothesis, MTB loads and the occurrence and size of lung granulomas were not increased in co-infected animals. These findings suggest that chronic filaria infections do not exacerbate MTB infection in the cotton rat model.
In Drosophila melanogaster, ppk23, a member of the DEG/ENaC family of ion channels, is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory-like chemosensory bristles that are distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. We found that disrupting ppk23 or inhibiting activity of ppk23-expressing neurons did not alter gustatory responses, but instead delayed the initiation and reduced the intensity of male courtship. Furthermore, mutations in ppk23 altered the behavioral response of males to the female-specific aphrodisiac pheromone 7, 11 ( Z ), 11 ( Z ) -Heptacosadiene. These data indicate that ppk23 and the cells expressing it play an important role in the peripheral sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila. Our data suggest that DEG/ENaC signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors, and indicate a novel physiological function for this important family of ion channels.
Mitochondrial tRNAs are imported from the cytosol in order to ensure proper mitochondrial translation in a wide range of organisms, including protozoa, fungi, higher plants, and humans. In the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas, we found a precise correlation between the mitochondrial codon usage and the nature and amount of imported tRNAs. This led to the hypothesis that tRNA import might be a dynamic process able to adapt to the mitochondrial genome content. To test this hypothesis, we manipulated the Chlamydomonas mitochondrial genome by introducing point mutations to modify its codon usage. We found that the codon usage modification resulted in reduced levels of mitochondrial translation as well as decreased levels and activities of respiratory complexes. These effects were linked to the consequential limitations of the pool of tRNAs in mitochondria. Our results indicate that tRNA mitochondrial import cannot be rapidly regulated in response to a novel genetic context and thus does not appear to be a dynamic process. Instead, the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutive adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery.
Glucose dysregulation, a hallmark of diabetes and prediabetes, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought. Current methods for quantifying blood glucose dysregulation are limited by reliance on single-time-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. We used continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) to evaluate the frequency and patterns of postprandial glucose elevations in individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. We developed an analytical framework to group individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses called “glucotypes” that reveal subphenotypes within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. We found that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability using CGM, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. The interindividual variability in glycemic responses to standardized meals highlights the personal nature of glucose regulation. We developed a model for identifying potential mechanisms of personal glucose dysregulation and built a webtool for visualizing a user-uploaded CGM profile and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes. Our results suggest that an increase in glucose variability might precede the currently used measures defining abnormal glucose levels and thus represent an earlier stage of “prediabetes. ”
EDR1 negatively regulates the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade in Arabidopsis to modulate plant innate immunity. We found that edr1 mutants have highly activated MPK3/MPK6 kinase activity and higher levels of MPK3/MPK6 proteins than wild type. EDR1 physically interacts with MKK4 and MKK5, and this interaction requires the N-terminal domain of EDR1. EDR1 also negatively affects MKK4/MKK5 protein levels. In addition, the mpk3, mkk4 and mkk5 mutations suppress edr1-mediated resistance, and over-expression of MKK4 or MKK5 causes edr1-like resistance and mildew-induced cell death. Our data indicate that EDR1 physically associates with MKK4/MKK5 and negatively regulates the MAPK cascade to fine-tune plant innate immunity.
In this study, we developed a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. We exploited the special structure of similarity matrices in our formulation to obtain a very efficient implementation. We then tested our framework on the problem of modeling Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever cases between 2004 and 2015 in Turkey. Our results showed that our Gaussian process formulation obtained better results than two frequently used standard machine learning algorithms ( i. e., random forests and boosted regression trees ) under temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal prediction scenarios. We proposed a computational framework that uses Gaussian processes as the basic building block to perform spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. We combined two similarity matrices to obtain a larger similarity matrix between location and time period pairs. Using the combined similarity matrix and reported cases counts, we trained a Gaussian process regression model to make predictions under three different scenarios: temporal prediction, spatial prediction, and spatiotemporal prediction.
Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is an important mosquito-borne viral zoonosis in Africa and the Middle East that causes human deaths and significant economic losses. We propose an almost periodic three-patch model to investigate the transmission dynamics of RVF virus ( RVFV ) among ruminants with spatial movements. Our findings indicate that human activities, including those associated with the Eid al Adha feast, along with a combination of climatic factors such as rainfall level and hydrological variations, contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the disease pathogen in Northeastern Africa. We show that sporadic outbreaks may occur when the two events occur together: 1 ) abundant livestock are recruited into areas at risk from RVF due to the demand for the religious festival and 2 ) abundant numbers of mosquitoes emerge. Our numerical results present the transmission dynamics of the disease pathogen over both short and long periods of time, particularly during the festival time. We investigate the impact on patterns of disease outbreaks in each patch brought by festival- and seasonal-driven factors, such as the number of livestock imported daily, the animal transportation speed from patch to patch, and the death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices. Our simulations show that when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual, the risk of massive disease outbreaks rises, particularly in patch 3 ( the place where the religious ceremony will be held ).
Anthrax is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Bacillus anthracis that affects both humans and animals. In Azerbaijan, the incidence of human anthrax has undergone significant changes since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. We analyzed data from 1984 to 2010 on livestock anthrax outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human anthrax incidence during the Soviet, post-Soviet, and preemptive livestock vaccination eras. Our results indicate that the incidence of human anthrax increased by 11. 95% from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline of 35. 24% after the initiation of livestock vaccination in 1996. We also found that the geographic distribution of human anthrax shifted from the west to the east during the study period. The incidence of human cutaneous anthrax was primarily concentrated in the west and south during the Soviet era, but shifted eastward towards the capital Baku in the mid-1990s. During the preemptive livestock vaccination period, the burden of disease remained primarily concentrated in eastern and northern Azerbaijan. Our findings highlight the need for an integrated “One Health” approach that takes into account the changing geographic distribution of the disease. Continued control measures in livestock are needed to mitigate the occurrence of human anthrax in Azerbaijan.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) have been found to modulate the activity of the Shaker voltage-gated potassium ( KV ) channel by shifting the voltage dependence of the channel to enable channel activation. PUFAs are essential components of cell membrane phospholipids in heart cells and neurons and have been extensively studied for their effects on voltage-gated ion channels. However, the molecular mechanism by which PUFAs modulate channel functioning remains an open question. In this study, we report on the interactions between the Shaker KV channel in open and closed states and a PUFA-enriched lipid bilayer using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations. We determined a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the channel located at the protein-lipid interface in the vicinity of the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain ( VSD ). In particular, the lipophilic PUFA tail covered a wide range of non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while the carboxylic head group displayed more specific interactions to polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices, encompassing the S3-S4 linker. Moreover, our study confirmed an increased conformational flexibility in the polyunsaturated carbon tails compared to saturated carbon chains, which may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins.
Cryptosporidiosis, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum, results in significant morbidity among children in developing countries and severe enteritis in immunocompromised patients. Current drugs lack efficacy in treating these conditions, and the development of novel anti-cryptosporidial therapeutics has been hampered by the poor experimental tractability of this pathogen. We have developed a pipeline of tools to accelerate the in vivo screening of inhibitors of C. parvum inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase ( IMPDH ). We have genetically engineered the related parasite Toxoplasma gondii to serve as a model of C. parvum infection, providing a rapid assessment of anti-parasitic potential and a quantitative read of target specificity. We have also developed a fluorescence-based assay of host cell proliferation and a C. parvum growth assay that utilizes automated high-content imaging analysis for enhanced throughput. We have used these assays to evaluate C. parvum IMPDH inhibitors emerging from our ongoing medicinal chemistry effort and have identified a subset of 1, 2, 3-triazole ethers that exhibit excellent in vivo selectivity in the T. gondii model and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity. These compounds are >100× more potent than paromomycin, the current standard for anticryptosporidial activity.
Tooth development is a highly heritable process that interacts with the development of the entire craniofacial complex. We performed a genome-wide association study of time to first tooth eruption and number of teeth at one year in 4, 564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort ( NFBC1966 ) and 1, 518 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( ALSPAC ). We identified 5 loci at P<5×10−8, and 5 with suggestive association ( P<5×10−6 ). The loci included several genes with links to tooth and other organ development ( KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, MSRB3 ). Genes at four of the identified loci are implicated in the development of cancer. A variant within the HOXB gene cluster associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31 years.
Down syndrome ( DS ) is the most common viable human aneuploidy caused by the trisomy of human chromosome 21 ( Hsa21 ). In contrast, the complete monosomy of Hsa21 is lethal, and only partial monosomy or mosaic monosomy of Hsa21 is seen. Both conditions lead to variable physiological abnormalities with constant intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. To search for dosage-sensitive genes involved in DS and monosomy 21 phenotypes, we created two new mouse models: the Ts3Yah carrying a tandem duplication and the Ms3Yah carrying a deletion of the Hspa13-App interval syntenic with 21q11. 2-q21. 3. Here we report that the trisomy and the monosomy of this region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance. The expression profiling of skeletal muscles revealed global changes in the regulation of genes implicated in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. These genes are downregulated in Ts3Yah mice and upregulated in Ms3Yah mice. The shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlates with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without an alteration in the respiratory function. However, the reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms3Yah mice, while the membrane permeability of Ts3Yah mitochondria slightly increased. Thus, we demonstrated how the Hspa13-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles certainly as a consequence of change in dose of Gabpa, Nrip1, and Atp5j. Our results indicate that the copy number variation in the Hspa13-App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.
G protein-gated K+ channels ( GIRK; Kir3 ), activated by Gβγ subunits derived from Gi/o proteins, regulate heartbeat and neuronal excitability and plasticity. Both neurotransmitter-evoked ( Ievoked ) and neurotransmitter-independent basal ( Ibasal ) GIRK activities are physiologically important, but mechanisms of Ibasal and its relation to Ievoked are unclear. We have previously shown for heterologously expressed neuronal GIRK1/2, and now show for native GIRK in hippocampal neurons, that Ibasal and Ievoked are interrelated: the extent of activation by neurotransmitter ( activation index, Ra ) is inversely related to Ibasal. To unveil the underlying mechanisms, we have developed a quantitative model of GIRK1/2 function. We characterized single-channel and macroscopic GIRK1/2 currents, and surface densities of GIRK1/2 and Gβγ expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Based on experimental results, we constructed a mathematical model of GIRK1/2 activity under steady-state conditions before and after activation by neurotransmitter. Our model accurately recapitulates Ibasal and Ievoked in Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells and hippocampal neurons; correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ and fully accounts for the inverse Ibasal-Ra correlation. Modeling indicates that, under all conditions and at different channel expression levels, between 3 and 4 Gβγ dimers are available for each GIRK1/2 channel. In contrast, available Gαi/o decreases from ~2 to less than one Gα per channel as GIRK1/2's density increases.
Plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria secrete transcription activator-like effectors ( TALEs ) into host cells, where they act as transcriptional activators on plant target genes to support bacterial virulence. TALEs have a unique modular DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats. We propose a novel approach for TALE target prediction, termed PrediTALE, to identify potential virulence targets. PrediTALE accounts for recent findings concerning TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding by repeats of aberrant lengths and the flexible strand orientation of target boxes relative to the transcription start of the downstream target gene. We benchmark PrediTALE using RNA-seq data after Xanthomonas infection in rice and find an overall improvement of prediction performance compared with previous approaches. Using PrediTALE, we are able to predict several novel putative virulence targets. However, we also observe that no target genes are predicted by any prediction tool for several TALEs, which we term orphan TALEs. We postulate that one explanation for orphan TALEs are incomplete gene annotations and propose to replace promoterome-wide by genome-wide scans for target boxes. We demonstrate that known targets from promoterome-wide scans may be recovered by genome-wide scans, whereas the latter, combined with RNA-seq data, are able to detect putative targets independent of existing gene annotations.
Mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations are potentially pathogenic amino acid changes affecting the human mitochondrial DNA. However, only a small subset has been functionally evaluated with certainty, while the pathogenicity of the vast majority has been assessed in-silico by software predictors. These tools have been shown to be rather incongruent. To address this issue, we have designed and implemented APOGEE, a machine-learning algorithm that outperforms existing prediction methods in estimating the harmfulness of mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations. APOGEE was built on a training set of 864 known mitochondrial variants and a test set of 100 variants drawn randomly with replacement. We calculated an array of performance metrics for APOGEE and aggregated individual predictors, which were reported in Table 1. We also calculated the frequency of coevolving amino acids and the mean MI Z-score for each amino acid site. These scores were computed for all 24, 189 non-synonymous amino acid changes potentially affecting the human mitochondrial DNA and made freely available from MitImpact. The APOGEE classifier is based on the Logistic Model Tree ( LMT ) and feeds third-party predictors with features strictly related to the 13 mitochondrial proteins. Its reasoning strategy was tuned on finely curated, non-overlapping, training sets of variations, and its predicting model was based on decision tree learning to provide investigable rules of pathogenicity.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) nonstructural protein 1 ( NS1 ) can cause thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage by activating platelets via Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ). We first demonstrated that DENV but not Zika virus cell culture supernatant could induce P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine ( PS ) exposure in human platelets, both of which were abolished when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Similar results were found using recombinant NS1 from all four serotypes of DENV, and those effects were blocked in the presence of anti-NS1 F ( ab’ ) 2, anti-TLR4 antibody, a TLR4 antagonist ( Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide, LPS-Rs ) and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor ( TAK242 ), but not polymyxin B ( an LPS inhibitor ). The activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted subthreshold concentrations of adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) -induced platelet aggregation and enhanced platelet adhesion to endothelial cells and phagocytosis by macrophages. Finally, we demonstrated that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. These results suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection.
Vasomotor tone, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure are regulated by dynamic control loops involving the arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) system, the atrial natriuretic peptide system ( ANP ), and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ). We performed a loop analysis of the AVP-ANP-RAAS system and found that it can be split into two coexisting dynamic systems, which contain alternatively the vascular smooth muscle ( VSM ) and the distal tubular cells ( DTC ) functional agents, thereby exerting their effects on blood pressure and blood volume, respectively. The AVP-ANP-RAAS endocrine control of body fluids and blood pressure was therefore analysed using mathematical tools, to highlight the loop arrangement and its dynamic function. Our results suggest that the physiological mechanisms regulating long-term homeostasis of blood hydraulic parameters are arranged into a complex of equivalent loop systems, consisting of candidate oscillators with a single equilibrium point. The AVP-ANP-VSM subsystem, which includes ANP and AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells, turns out to be a candidate oscillator composed of a monotone system with multiple negative feedback loops, and its oscillatory potential is higher when the delays along all feedback loops are comparable.
Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The formation of a fibrin network, also known as a fibrin cap, on the surface of a thrombus has been identified as a novel mechanism that limits thrombus growth. In this study, the transport of proteins through the fibrin network was studied by integrating experiments with model simulations. The results show that the permeability of the fibrin network and the diffusivity of proteins are important factors that determine the transport of proteins through the fibrin network. The formation of a fibrin cap prevents small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events by limiting the exposure of platelets on the thrombus surface to thrombin. The fibrin cap also restricts the approach of resting platelets in the flowing blood to the thrombus core, thus preventing platelet activation and limiting thrombus growth.
Invariant natural killer T ( iNKT ) cells are known to be activated during Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection, but the mechanisms by which they control Mtb growth are not well understood. In this study, we investigated how iNKT cells suppress intracellular Mtb replication. We found that iNKT cell activation, as measured by CD25 upregulation and IFNγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by infected macrophages. In contrast, iNKT cell control of Mtb growth was CD1d-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFNγ. This suggests that conventional activation markers do not correlate with iNKT cell effector function during Mtb infection. We also found that iNKT cell control of Mtb replication was independent of TNF and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Instead, we identified GM-CSF as a novel mediator of iNKT cell antimicrobial activity. iNKT cells produced GM-CSF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1d-dependent manner during Mtb infection, and GM-CSF was both necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth. These findings demonstrate that GM-CSF production is a novel iNKT cell antimicrobial effector function and suggest a potential role for GM-CSF in T cell immunity against Mtb.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, is a common component of human intestinal flora. To gain insight into C. albicans colonization, genes expressed by fungi grown within a host were studied. The EFH1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during growth of C. albicans in the intestinal tract. Unexpectedly, an efh1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, whereas an EFH1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and of the oral cavity of athymic mice. When inoculated into the bloodstream of mice, both efh1 null and EFH1 overexpressing strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, other mutants are attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation but exhibited normal levels of intestinal colonization. These results show that expression of EFH1 regulates the level of colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. Expression of several genes is dependent on transcription factor Efg1p during laboratory growth, but Efg1p-independent expression of these genes was observed during growth within the murine intestinal tract.
Immunization with irradiated Plasmodium sporozoites is the most effective vaccine strategy against liver stages of malaria parasites. However, the mechanisms underpinning the success of this approach are unknown. Here, we show that the complete development of protective CD8+ T cell responses requires prolonged antigen presentation. Using TCR transgenic cells specific for the malaria circumsporozoite protein, we found that sporozoite antigen persists for over 8 weeks after immunization. The persisting antigen was detected in lymphoid organs and depends on the presence of CD11c+ cells. Prolonged antigen presentation enhanced the magnitude of the CD8+ T cell response in several ways. Firstly, reducing the time primed CD8+ T cells were exposed to antigen in vivo severely reduced the final size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expanded in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naïve animals. Finally, persisting antigen was able to prime naïve cells, including recent thymic emigrants, to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver. Together, these data show that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages is dependent upon the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen.
Leishmanicidal and antimicrobial potential of biodegradable nanocarriers coated with polymyxin B ( PBCAnp-polB ) was evaluated in this study. PBCAnp-polB were fabricated by anionic polymerization and presented an adequate size of 261. 5 ± 25. 9 nm, low polydispersity index ( PDI ), and ζ potential of 1. 79 ± 0. 17 mV. The 50% drug release from PBCAnp-polB was 6–7 times slower than the free polB, which favors a prolonged and desired release profile. In vitro evaluations showed that polB alone reduced in vitro amastigote infection of macrophages without complete parasite elimination, even at higher concentrations. The nanocarrier PBCAnp also presented leishmanicidal effect and surpassed polB activity; however, no antimicrobial activity was detected. PolB maintained its activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella, adding antimicrobial properties to the nanoparticles. The IC50 value found for free polB was 77. 1 μg/mL ( 59. 2 μM ). PBCAnp-polB presented a coating of approximately 2. 4 x 105 molecules of polB per unit, with a sustained release profile. The optimal PBCAnp in pharmaceutics aspects presented antileishmanial activity by itself, superposing polB activity.
Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a severe form of leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the intracellular protozoan parasite Leishmania infantum. In Brazil, VL is a major public health problem with high mortality rates. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors for death from VL in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. We analyzed data from the Reportable Disease Information System-SINAN ( Brazilian Ministry of Health ) relating to the clinical manifestations of the disease from 2002 to 2009. Two multivariate logistic regression models were developed to identify variables associated with death from VL. Model 1 included variables present in both SINAN versions ( 2002–2009; 111 deaths from VL and 777 cured patients ), and Model 2 included variables common to both SINAN versions plus additional variables included in the Net version ( 2007–2009; 49 deaths from VL and 327 cured patients ). In Model 1, the variables significantly associated with a greater risk of death from VL were weakness ( OR 2. 9; 95%CI 1. 3–6. 4 ), Leishmania-HIV co-infection ( OR 2. 4; 95%CI 1. 2–4. 8 ) and age ≥60 years ( OR 2. 5; 95%CI 1. 5–4. 3 ). In Model 2, the variables associated with death from VL were bleeding ( OR 3. 5; 95%CI 1. 2–10. 3 ), other associated infections ( OR 3. 2; 95%CI 1. 3–7. 8 ), jaundice ( OR 10. 1; 95%CI 3. 7–27. 2 ) and age ≥60 years ( OR 3. 1; 95%CI 1. 4–7. 1 ).
The Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase ( LRR-RLK ) BAK1 plays a central role in plant growth, cell death, and innate immunity. Here, we describe a novel allele of BAK1, bak1-5, which differentially regulates three BAK1-dependent signaling pathways. bak1-5 mutant plants are severely impaired in innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent receptor kinases FLS2 and EFR, but not in BR signaling or cell death control. In contrast to the RD kinase BRI1, FLS2 and EFR have very low kinase activity and are unable to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. Furthermore, kinase activity is dispensable for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta. However, the specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 requires BAK1-5 kinase activity. Overall, our results demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by BAK1, which may reveal key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD receptor kinases.
The cell cycle response to anticancer treatment is a complex process that extends over several cell generations and cannot be fully captured by current methods. A new experimental/computational approach combines time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data to render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during and after treatment. The approach models the effects of treatments with modules describing the functional activity of the main pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase of the cell cycle. A framework modelling environment was created to apply different types of modules in each phase and test models at the complexity level justified by the available data. The method was challenged with time-course measures taken in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse live cell microscopy in X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells, spanning a wide range of doses. The most suitable model of the treatment, including the dose-response of each effect, was progressively built by combining modules with a rational strategy and fitting simultaneously all data of different doses and platforms. The final model gave the first complete rendering in silico of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, providing separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2/M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations.
Coenzyme Q ( CoQ ) is an essential electron carrier in the respiratory chain whose deficiency has been implicated in a wide variety of human mitochondrial disease manifestations. We now show that a presumed autoimmune kidney disease in mice with the missense Pdss2kd/kd genotype can be attributed to a mitochondrial CoQ biosynthetic defect. Levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in kidney homogenates from B6. Pdss2kd/kd mutants were significantly lower than those in B6 control mice. Disease manifestations originate specifically in glomerular podocytes, as renal disease is seen in Podocin/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice but not in conditional knockouts targeted to renal tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional B6. Alb/cre, Pdss2loxP/loxP knockout mice have no overt disease despite demonstration that their livers have undetectable CoQ9 levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and significantly altered intermediary metabolism as evidenced by transcriptional profiling and amino acid quantitation. These data suggest that disease manifestations of CoQ deficiency relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity thresholds, with glomerular podocytes displaying the greatest sensitivity to Pdss2 impairment.
Phenotypic robustness is an important characteristic of life, but its underlying mechanisms and evolutionary origins are not well understood. Here, we report that determinative developmental cell lineages of two protostomes and one deuterostome are robust to environmental and genetic perturbations, such as necrosis and cell division program failure. Our computational analysis of these cell lineages reveals that several features, including their shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearances of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types, underlie this robustness. These features allow the resulting cellular compositions of the organisms to be only modestly affected by cell deaths. We propose that the observed robustness arose as an adaptation in the face of random cell deaths in development. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness that manifests at the supracellular level and is a unique feature of multicellular organisms. This mechanism complements subcellular and cellular mechanisms of robustness to form a multi-layer defense system against environmental and genetic perturbations. Our study provides a novel explanation of the contribution of ontogenesis to phenotypic robustness and opens the door toward characterizing systemic properties of complex cell lineages.
Here, we present EmbryoPhenomics, an open-source high-throughput platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos. The platform consists of an Open-source Video Microscope ( OpenVIM ) and a Python package Embryo Computer Vision ( EmbryoCV ). OpenVIM produces high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under tightly controlled environmental conditions, while EmbryoCV extracts phenomic data for morphological, physiological, behavioural, and proxy traits during embryonic development. We demonstrate the broad-scale applicability of EmbryoPhenomics in a series of experiments assessing chronic, acute, and multistressor responses to environmental change ( temperature and salinity ) in >30 million images of >600 embryos of two species with markedly different patterns of development—the pond snail Radix balthica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. EmbryoPhenomics can acquire and process data capturing functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest, most dynamic life stages. We demonstrate the capability of OpenVIM to document the development of large numbers of aquatic embryos in experimental treatments ranging from long- ( >240 h ) to short-term ( 24 h ) exposures. EmbryoCV successfully extracted phenome-level data from 95% of the >30 million images acquired, producing high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioural embryo responses.
Malaria parasites ( Plasmodium spp. ) undergo dramatic changes in metabolism during their complex life cycles in the mosquito and human hosts. We have used stable isotope labelling, targeted metabolomics and reverse genetics to map stage-specific changes in Plasmodium berghei carbon metabolism and determine the functional significance of these changes on parasite survival in the blood and mosquito stages. We show that glutamine serves as the predominant input into tricarboxylic acid ( TCA ) metabolism in both asexual and sexual blood stages and is important for complete male gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolism, as well as key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis, are also essential for ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito. These data extend our knowledge of Plasmodium metabolism and point towards possible targets for transmission-blocking intervention strategies. Furthermore, they highlight significant metabolic differences between Plasmodium species which are not easily anticipated based on genomics or transcriptomics studies and underline the importance of integration of metabolomics data with other platforms in order to better inform drug discovery and design.
Incoherent feedforward loops ( IFFLs ) are a common motif found in many biological signaling pathways. These networks are able to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in the regulation of downstream gene expression. IFFLs consist of an input that simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output, and can exhibit temporal adaptation, where the system is desensitized to a sustained input. This property allows IFFLs to distinguish input signals with varying temporal profiles. Here, we use quantitative modeling to examine the ability of IFFLs to process oscillatory signals. Our results indicate that the system’s ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints. The kinetics of the IFFL components dictate the input range for which the network is able to decode pulsatile dynamics. In addition, a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics is required for optimal “counting” of oscillatory signals.
Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is an obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacterium transmitted to humans by the bite of a Leptotrombidium mite. Despite being a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia, research into the basic mechanisms of cell biology and pathogenicity of O. tsutsugamushi has lagged behind that of other important human pathogens. One reason for this is that O. tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular bacterium that can only be cultured in mammalian cells and requires specific methodologies for propagation and analysis. Here, we present a body of work designed to improve methods for quantification, propagation, purification and long-term storage of O. tsutsugamushi. A clinical isolate of O. tsutsugamushi was grown in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast ( L929 ) cells and bacterial growth was measured using an O. tsutsugamushi-specific qPCR assay. We present a standardised method for comparing the viability of O. tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment and propagation under various conditions. Our results will be useful to other researchers working on O. tsutsugamushi and other obligate intracellular pathogens such as those in the Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales families.
Schistosoma haematobium is a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a major cause of morbidity worldwide. The antihelminthic drug praziquantel ( PZQ ) is currently used to control schistosomiasis, but its safety and efficacy in children aged 1–5 years have not been well established. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of PZQ treatment in 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1–5 years who were naturally exposed to S. haematobium infection. The children were treated with PZQ tablets and side effects were assessed through questionnaires completed by their caregivers within 24 hours of treatment. Six weeks after treatment, schistosome egg counts in urine were used to determine treatment efficacy. The results showed that PZQ treatment significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in 1–5 year olds with an egg reduction rate ( ERR ) of 99% and a cure rate ( CR ) of 92%. This was comparable to the efficacy of PZQ in 6–10 year olds, where ERR was 96% and CR was 67%. Only 3. 8% of the children reported side effects within 24 hours of treatment, which included stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of the face and body. These findings suggest that PZQ treatment is as safe and efficacious in children aged 1–5 years as it is in older children.
A genome-wide RNA interference ( RNAi ) screen in Drosophila melanogaster has been used to identify novel genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis. Ras is a small GTPase that is mutated in ~30% of human cancers. However, Ras mutations alone are not sufficient for tumorigenesis, and therefore, it is necessary to identify cooperating cancer-relevant signaling pathways. We have identified multiple novel, evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis in Drosophila. The top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes were validated in secondary Drosophila assays, identifying many known cancer genes and multiple novel candidate genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumorigenesis. Among the novel top 80 candidate cancer genes, we have mechanistically characterized the function of the top hit, Tetraspanin 29Fb ( Tsp29Fb ). Tsp29Fb regulates EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion in Drosophila. The mammalian orthologs of the fly hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing novel prognostic markers for human epithelial tumors. Low expression of the confirmed hits significantly correlated with the KRASG12 mutation status and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.
Meiotic drivers are selfish alleles that increase their transmission into progeny by subverting gametogenesis. They impose a fitness cost on the genome, leading to the evolution of suppressors. Here, we investigate the wtf gene family from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, previously shown to contain meiotic drivers in wild isolates. We demonstrate that wtf13 is a meiotic driver that kills spores that do not inherit it by generating a diffusible poison and a spore-specific antidote. We also show that wtf13 is suppressed by another wtf gene, wtf18-2, which arose spontaneously in the lab and encodes only an antidote. wtf18-2 rescues only the spores that inherit it, selfishly gaining a transmission advantage while dampening the drive of wtf13. This establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic drive suppressors and provides insight into the mechanisms and evolution of drive systems. Our results are consistent with the idea that an ancestral wtf gene was a dual-transcript poison-antidote meiotic driver, and that novel duplications of this ancestral driver could have been selected based on their abilities to cause drive and protect spores from the poison of the ancestral driver.
Gene expression variation among human individuals plays a key role in the susceptibility to different diseases and phenotypes. A major goal is to predict gene expression changes among individuals based on their genetic sequence variation. Here, we present an algorithm that predicts the expression of genes of unseen individuals given only their genotype in the local genomic vicinity of the predicted gene. The algorithm is remarkably robust and agrees well between the training and test sets, even when the training and test sets consist of individuals from distinct populations. We also present an extension that incorporates heterogeneous types of genomic annotations to differentially weigh the importance of the various genetic variants. Assigning higher weights to variants with particular annotations such as proximity to genes and high regional G/C content can further improve the predictions. We show that genes that are successfully predicted have, on average, higher expression and more variability across individuals, providing insight into the characteristics of the types of genes that can be predicted from their cis genetic variation. Notably, a subset of genes are predicted better by our algorithm when incorporating information from populations other than that of the predicted individuals, suggesting that part of the predictive sequence variation is shared across different populations and may be hard to distill using only individuals from the same population.
Malarial parasites are genetically diverse, leading to competitive interactions between strains. To understand the evolution of virulence and drug resistance, we need a quantitative understanding of the competition between strains. In this study, we investigated the cause of competitive suppression of an avirulent clone of Plasmodium chabaudi ( AS ) by a virulent clone ( AJ ) in immuno-deficient and competent mice. We used dynamical-model based Bayesian inference to test whether competitive suppression is caused by clone-specific differences in adaptive immune clearance of merozoites and parasitised red blood cells ( RBCs ), background loss of merozoites and parasitised RBCs, RBC age preference, RBC infection rate, burst size, and within-RBC interference. We found that just one parameter, the ratio of background loss rate of merozoites to invasion rate of mature RBCs, needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. This parameter was the same for both clones in single-clone infections, but different between the clones in mixed infections. The size of this difference was largest in immuno-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice. This explains why competitive suppression was alleviated in immuno-deficient mice. We found that competitive suppression acts early in infection, even before the day of peak parasitaemia. Our results suggest that the innate immune response clearing merozoites is the most likely mediator of competitive interactions between virulent and avirulent clones.
Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification ( ODIRA ) is a model proposed to explain the generation of interstitial, inverted triplications, a type of copy number variation ( CNV ). This model proposes that a replication error at pre-existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences generates an extrachromosomal, inverted dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate. This intermediate subsequently integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication without loss of distal chromosomal sequences. We show that the proposed replication error—the ligation of leading and lagging nascent strands to create “closed” forks—can occur in vitro at short, interrupted inverted repeats. The removal of molecules with two closed forks results in a hairpin-capped linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted, dimeric plasmid. This plasmid subsequently integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication. Our tests of key features of ODIRA lend support to this mechanism and suggest that it can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons that have a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent.
Influenza virus infection alters the sites of translation initiation in mammalian cells, potentially leading to the production of novel immune epitopes. Here, we systematically investigate the extent and impact of alternate translation initiation in cells infected with influenza virus. We first perform evolutionary analyses that suggest selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza virus lineages that have adapted to mammalian hosts. We then use ribosome profiling with the initiation inhibitor lactimidomycin to experimentally delineate translation initiation sites in a human lung epithelial cell line infected with influenza virus. We identify several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, all of which occur at AUG codons that are downstream of canonical initiation codons. One of these candidate downstream start sites truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N1 neuraminidase protein, resulting in loss of its cytoplasmic tail and a portion of the transmembrane domain. This truncated neuraminidase protein is expressed on the cell surface during influenza virus infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. We do not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon influenza infection or during the anti-viral response, but the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli ( EHEC ), cause an enormous economic and health burden. EHEC causes a severe bloody diarrhea and a potentially fatal kidney disease ( hemolytic uremic syndrome ) for which there is no effective treatment or prophylaxis. EHEC and other enteric pathogens utilize a type III secretion system ( T3SS ) to inject virulence proteins ( effectors ) into host cells. In this study, we present evidence that the E. coli O157:H7 nleH1 and nleH2 genes encode T3SS effectors that bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 ( RPS3 ), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells ( NF-κB ) transcriptional complexes. NleH1 and NleH2 co-localized with RPS3 in the cytoplasm, but not in cell nuclei. The N-terminal region of both NleH1 and NleH2 was required for binding to the N-terminus of RPS3. NleH1 and NleH2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr protein kinases, but their binding to RPS3 is independent of kinase activity. NleH1, but not NleH2, reduced the nuclear abundance of RPS3 without altering the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits or affecting the phosphorylation state or abundance of the inhibitory NF-κB chaperone IκBα. NleH1 repressed the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, but did not inhibit the transcription of RPS3-independent reporters. In contrast, NleH2 stimulated RPS3-dependent transcription, as well as an AP-1-dependent reporter.
Transcription factor ( TF ) binding to its DNA target site is a fundamental regulatory interaction. The most common model used to represent TF binding specificities is the position specific scoring matrix ( PSSM ), which assumes independence between binding positions. However, in many cases, this simplifying assumption does not hold. Here, we present feature motif models ( FMMs ), a novel probabilistic method for modeling TF–DNA interactions, based on log-linear models. Our approach uses sequence features to represent TF binding specificities, where each feature may span multiple positions. We develop the mathematical formulation of our model and devise an algorithm for learning its structural features from binding site data. We also developed a discriminative motif finder, which discovers de novo FMMs that are enriched in target sets of sequences compared to background sets. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and on the widely used TF chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) dataset of Harbison et al. We then apply our algorithm to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human, revealing sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs, and show that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs.
Sympathetic nervous activity in humans and chimpanzees is regulated by the adrenergic α2C receptor ( ADRA2C ), an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. We find that the neuronal expression of ADRA2C is lower in humans and chimpanzees than in other primates. We identified a cis-regulatory region whose DNA sequences have been significantly accelerated in humans and chimpanzees. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor ( NRSF ) binding motifs, each of which harbours a polymorphism. Our genotyping and analysis of population genome data indicate that at both polymorphic sites, the derived allele has reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees but not in bonobos, whereas only the ancestral allele is present among macaques. Our CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays show that both derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C, most likely by increasing NRSF binding. In addition, we detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. Our findings indicate that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.
C4 photosynthesis represents one of the most remarkable examples of convergent evolution, with at least 60 independent origins in both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. This highly complex trait is associated with an increase in productivity by ∼50% in tropical and subtropical areas. We developed a new informatics framework to enable deep evolutionary comparison of gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. We compared gene expression in two independent C4 lineages, Cleome gynandra and Zea mays, whose last common ancestor diverged ∼140 million years ago. We defined a cohort of 3, 335 genes that represent conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. We show that genes encoding proteins of the C4 cycle are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes. Despite the wide evolutionary separation and independent origins of the C4 phenotype, we report that these species use homologous transcription factors to both induce C4 photosynthesis and to maintain the cell specific gene expression required for the pathway to operate. We define a core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation that is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of the monocotyledons and dicotyledons.
Ebola virus ( EBOV ) was the cause of an unprecedented epidemic in West Africa from 2013 to 2016, which spread to Europe and North America, infecting several Health Care Workers ( HCW ). To develop new countermeasures and understand the pathways of human-to-human transmission, we need a better understanding of EBOV infection patterns in different body compartments. We longitudinally explored the persistence of EBOV-specific negative sense genomic RNA ( neg-RNA ) and the presence of positive sense RNA ( pos-RNA ), including replication intermediate ( antigenomic-RNA ) and messenger RNA ( mRNA ) molecules, in the upper and lower respiratory tract, as compared to plasma, in a HCW infected with EBOV in Sierra Leone, who was hospitalized in Rome, Italy. We observed persistence of pos-RNA and neg-RNAs in the lower respiratory tract even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting possible local replication. This study aims to enhance the knowledge on the biological features of EBOV that can contribute to the human-to-human transmissibility and to develop effective intervention strategies.
New World arenaviruses, such as Machupo virus ( MACV ) and Junin virus ( JUNV ), cause hemorrhagic fever diseases in humans in South America. We previously reported that a recombinant, chimeric MACV ( rMACV/Cd#1-GPC ) expressing glycoprotein from the Candid#1 ( Cd#1 ) vaccine strain of JUNV is completely attenuated in a murine model and protects animals from lethal challenge with MACV. To investigate the role of different domains of Cd#1 GPC in the attenuation of MACV, we rescued several rMACVs expressing the ectodomain of GPC from Cd#1 either alone ( MCg1 ), along with the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) F438I substitution ( MCg2 ), or with the TMD of Cd#1 ( MCg3 ). All rMACVs exhibited similar growth curves in cultured cells. In mice, the MCg1 displayed significant reduction in lethality as compared with rMACV. The MCg1 was detected in brains and spleens of MCg1-infected mice and the infection was associated with tissue inflammation. On the other hand, all animals survived MCg2 and MCg3 infection without detectable levels of virus in various organs while producing neutralizing antibody against Cd#1. Our data suggest the indispensable role of each GPC domain in the full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1 GPC.
Mutations in the centromeric histone 3 variant ( CENH3 ) induce post-zygotic incompatibility and uniparental inheritance in Arabidopsis. The CENH3 histone is essential for the proper segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis. To better understand the functional constraints of CENH3, we complemented a null allele in Arabidopsis with a variety of mutant alleles, each inducing a single amino acid change in conserved residues of the histone fold domain. We found that many of these transgenic missense lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-pollination, but exhibited frequent post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. The failure of centromeres marked by these missense mutations in the histone fold domain of CENH3 reproduces the genome elimination syndromes described with chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species. We also found that a single point mutation is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, providing a simple one-step method for the identification of non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species.
Human embryonic stem cells ( hESCs ) have the ability to differentiate into various cell types, including cardiac precursors. However, the role of alternative splicing ( AS ) in this process is not well understood. In this study, hESCs were modified to allow selection of pluripotent cells by neomycin resistance and cardiac precursors by puromycin resistance. Exon-level microarray expression data from undifferentiated hESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify splice isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural differentiation expression patterns. These isoforms corresponded to genes involved in cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle checkpoint control, as well as genes with serine/threonine kinase and helicase activity. Using a new program called AltAnalyze, we identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that were predicted to affect protein function and expression. These changes included an enrichment of splice isoforms that oppose cell-cycle arrest in hESCs and that promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors. Our data suggest that AS may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation.
Trehalose-6-phosphate ( T6P ) synthase OtsA and T6P phosphatase OtsB2 are key enzymes in the biosynthesis of trehalose in Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ). Trehalose biosynthesis is considered an attractive target for the development of antimicrobials against M. tuberculosis. To assess the drug target potential of T6P phosphatase, we generated a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis allowing the regulated gene silencing of the otsB2 gene. We found that otsB2 is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and for the acute infection phase in mice following aerosol infection. However, otsB2 is not essential for the chronic infection phase in mice, highlighting the substantial remodelling of trehalose metabolism during infection by M. tuberculosis. We found that blocking OtsB2 resulted in the accumulation of its substrate T6P, which appears to be toxic, leading to the self-poisoning of cells. T6P accumulation elicited a global upregulation of more than 800 genes, which might result from an increase in RNA stability implied by the enhanced neutralization of toxins exhibiting ribonuclease activity. Our data conclusively show that essentiality of OtsB2 relies on direct or indirect toxic effects associated with OtsA-mediated T6P accumulation.
Chagas' disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T. cruzi ), is a life-threatening illness affecting 11–18 million people worldwide. Current treatments are limited and have poor efficacy and safety profiles. Recent studies have identified T. cruzi proline racemase ( TcPR ) as an attractive candidate for improved chemotherapeutic intervention. TcPR is believed to expose critical residues that elicit a host mitogenic B-cell response, a process contributing to parasite persistence and immune system evasion. However, characterization of the conformational states of TcPR requires access to long-time-scale motions that are currently inaccessible by standard molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we describe advanced accelerated molecular dynamics simulations that extend the effective simulation time and capture large-scale motions of functional relevance. Our results indicate that the mitogenic properties of TcPR are likely associated with the exposure of conserved conformational epitopes located around previously unidentified binding pockets. We show for the first time a model for the open form of TcPR obtained through the application of state of the art molecular dynamic simulation. Our results provide new insights for future structure-based drug discovery and constitute an important step toward the rationalization of the molecular basis behind the mitogenic B-cell response of TcPR.
We report the development of an inducible and reversible gene knockout ( iKO ) system in mice. The iKO system is based on a binary approach combining two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout ( KO ) line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated ( TIGRE ) genomic locus. The TIGRE locus provides for low basal expression and high inducibility of the target gene. We have developed a method to easily introduce genes into the TIGRE site of mouse embryonic stem ( ES ) cells by recombinase-mediated insertion. The iKO system allows for the efficient production of reversible and inducible gene knockout and rescue in mice. The system can be turned on and off at will by treating the mice with doxycycline. As a proof of concept, we have created iKO mice in the apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) gene, which allows for sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. The results demonstrated reversible switching of ApoE transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system shows stringent regulation and is a versatile genetic system that can easily incorporate other techniques and adapt to a wide range of applications.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, can be transmitted from mother to child through congenital infection. However, little is known about the genetic response of the placental environment to T. cruzi infection. In this study, we used a murine model to investigate the genetic response of the placenta to infection by two different T. cruzi strains: K98, a clone of the non-lethal myotropic CA-I strain ( TcI ), and VD ( TcVI ), isolated from a human case of congenital infection. We used functional genomics by microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles of placentas from uninfected mice and mice infected with either K98 or VD. Our results showed that both infected groups had down-regulation of the “Secretory Granule” pathway, whereas the “Innate Immune Response” and “Response to Interferon-gamma” pathways were up-regulated in VD-infected mice but not in K98-infected mice. We also found that metabolic processes, transcription, and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas, and that some pathways related to cascade signaling had opposite regulation in VD and K98-infected mice. Furthermore, we detected a stronger tropism of the VD strain to the placental organ by detecting parasite DNA and RNA. Our study is the first to describe the genetic response of the placental environment to T. cruzi infection in a murine model.
Sindbis virus ( SINV ), also known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland, is a mosquito-borne virus that mainly occurs in tropical and sub-tropical countries. In northern Europe, SINV is suggested to cause regularly reoccurring outbreaks, with a hypothesised seven-year cycle of outbreaks based on reported human cases. We evaluated mosquito abundance and SINV prevalence in vector mosquitoes from an endemic area in central Sweden to find a more objective outbreak signal. Mosquitoes were collected in the River Dalälven floodplains during the years before, during, and after the hypothesised 2002 outbreak year and assayed for virus on cell culture. The obtained isolates were partially sequenced, and the nucleotide sequences were analysed using Bayesian maximum clade credibility and median joining network analysis. Our findings suggest that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes constitutes the most valuable outbreak marker for further scrutinising the hypothesised seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks. In 2002, the Maximum Likelihood Estimated infection rates were 10. 0/1000 in the enzootic vectors Culex torrentium/pipiens, and 0. 62/1000 in the bridge-vector Aedes cinereus, compared to 4. 9/1000 and 0. 0/1000 in 2001 and 0. 0/1000 and 0. 32/1000 in 2003. The genetic analysis revealed local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years.
The locust olfactory system is a well-studied preparation for investigating the interaction of multiple coding mechanisms. In this system, the antennal lobe ( AL ) transforms dense, transiently synchronized spike trains across ensembles of neurons into a sparse representation in the mushroom body ( MB ), a region associated with memory. Recordings made in vivo from the locust MB demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells ( KCs ). Typically, only a few KCs from the recorded population of neurons responded reliably when a specific odor was presented. Different odors induced responses in different KCs. Here, we explored the possibility that plasticity may control and tune synaptic weights of inputs to the mushroom body to ensure the specificity of KCs' responses to familiar or meaningful odors. We found that plasticity at the synapses between the AL and the MB efficiently regulated the delicate tuning necessary to selectively filter the intense AL oscillatory output and condense it to a sparse representation in the MB. Activity-dependent plasticity drove the observed specificity, reliability, and expected persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role for plasticity in information processing and making a testable prediction about synaptic plasticity at AL-MB synapses.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression ( STAGE ) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes important for the development of coronary artery disease ( CAD ). The study analyzed 278 transcriptional profiles from liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, and atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial wall tissues isolated from CAD patients during coronary artery bypass surgery. Using two-way clustering, the study identified 60 tissue clusters, of which one cluster in atherosclerotic arterial wall and one in visceral fat segregated patients into two groups differing in the extent of coronary stenosis ( P = 0. 008 and P = 0. 00015, respectively ). The associations of these clusters with coronary atherosclerosis were validated by analyzing carotid atherosclerosis expression profiles. The study found that genes in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes ( TEML ) pathway were overrepresented in all three clusters, referred to as the atherosclerosis module ( A-module ). The A-module was found to be genetically enriched with CAD risk by 1. 8-fold ( P<0. 004 ). The transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 ( LDB2 ) was identified as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, supported by subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2–deficient arterial wall.
The circadian clock of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus is regulated by the KaiC protein, which runs through different phospho-states during a 24-hour cycle. The regulation of the kaiBC gene, which encodes the KaiB and KaiC proteins, plays a key role in the circadian clockwork. However, it has remained unclear which phospho-state of KaiC is involved in transcriptional activation and which in transcriptional suppression of kaiBC expression. To address this question, we systematically analyzed various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional feedback regulation by introducing a combined transcriptional/translational feedback loop ( TTFL ) and post-translational oscillator ( PTO ) model. Only a particular two-loop feedback mechanism was able to reproduce existing experimental observations, including the effects of knockout or overexpression of kai genes. Our model suggests that threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kaiBC transcription, while unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress it. We propose that the peak expression ratio of the positive and negative components of kaiBC expression is the main factor for how the different two-loop feedback models respond to removal or overexpression of kai genes.
HIV-2 infection is characterized by low pathogenicity and replicative potential. We investigated the distribution of HIV-2 reservoirs in antiretroviral-naive HIV-2 infected individuals. We found that HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals and was quantifiable in transitional-memory CD4 T-cells ( TTM ) from 4 individuals, but in central-memory CD4 T-cells ( TCM ) from only 1 individual. HIV-2 DNA levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) positively correlated with those in TTM but not TCM. HIV-2 reactivation was observed in cells from only 3 individuals. We also found that TCM had a lower expression of CXCR6 transcripts and a higher expression of TRIM5 transcripts compared to TTM. These findings suggest that HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and a limited infection of TCM associated with a lower expression of a potential alternative HIV-2 co-receptor, CXCR6, and a higher expression of a restriction factor, TRIM5. These findings shed new light on the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection and suggest mechanisms similar to those reported in other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection.
The Attentional Routing Circuit ( ARC ) is a spiking neuron model that provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in cortex. The model is implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons, with computations for performing selective attentional processing mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. The ARC is shown to quantitatively match several observed forms of attentional modulation, including shifting and shrinking of receptive fields, increases in responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features ( i. e. response gain ), and the effect on contrast-response functions being better explained as a response-gain effect than as contrast-gain. Unlike past models, the ARC embodies a single mechanism that unifies the above forms of attentional modulation, is consistent with a wide array of available data, and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions. The ARC's mechanisms for selective routing predict that spatial attention only affects neural spatial selectivity, without altering selectivity for other feature dimensions. The model further predicts that the seemingly different forms of attentional modulation are consequences of a single mechanism for selective attentional routing, and that an increasing proportion of neurons at each higher cortical level will show attentional modulation as a result of neurons switching from their default routing state to a selective routing state during attentionally demanding tasks.
Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) is a common and heritable arrhythmia associated with substantial morbidity. We examined the contribution of coding genetic variation to AF susceptibility in a large community-based sample of 1, 734 individuals with AF and 9, 423 without AF from the Framingham Heart Study, Cardiovascular Health Study, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, and NHLBI-GO Exome Sequencing Project. None of the 99, 404 common variants evaluated was significantly associated with AF after adjusting for multiple testing. Among the most significantly associated variants was a common missense variant in SYNPO2L ( rs3812629, p. Pro707Leu, odds ratio 1. 27, 95% confidence interval 1. 13–1. 43, P = 6. 6x10-5 ), which lies at a known AF susceptibility locus and is in linkage disequilibrium with a top marker from prior analyses at the locus. We did not observe significant associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Individuals with AF did not display any statistically significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated AF genes. These findings suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF.
Alveolar echinococcosis ( AE ), caused by the larval stage of Echinococcus multilocularis, is an emerging disease in Poland. Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 human cases of AE were detected, with 83 confirmed, 16 probable, and 22 possible cases. The majority of cases ( 76% ) were diagnosed in an advanced stage of the disease. The liver was the primary location of AE in all cases, and in 24. 8% of patients, the disease spread to other organs. The majority of patients ( 94% ) were treated with albendazole, and 60% underwent a surgical operation, including 15 liver transplantations. Unfortunately, the disease was fatal in 19% of patients, with a mean age at death of 54. 1 years. The majority of cases ( 68. 6% ) occurred in the north-eastern part of Poland, where a family agglomeration of AE was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients. The mean age of patients at the time of diagnosis was 47. 7 years, and the sex ratio was 0. 86/1. 0 ( male/female ).
Metalloregulatory proteins, such as the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator ( Zur ) protein, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to changes in metal availability. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of Zur at each of the known Zur-regulated genes in Escherichia coli. We solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PznuABC promoter and found that this metalloregulatory protein represses gene expression by a highly cooperative binding of two adjacent dimers to essentially encircle the core element of each of the Zur-regulated promoters. Cooperativity in these protein-DNA interactions requires a pair of asymmetric salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp49′ that connect otherwise independent dimers. We also discovered a new member of the Zur-regulon, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc responsive manner. The pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers with significantly less protein-DNA cooperativity than observed at other Zur-regulon promoters. We found that the number of ferric uptake regulator ( Fur )-family dimers that bind within any given promoter varies significantly and that the thermodynamic profile of the Zur-DNA interactions directly correlates with the physiological response at different promoters. These findings open the door to understanding how zinc availability and partial metal occupancy at a subset of the eight zinc binding sites in the repressor complex can fine tune stress responsive gene expression across a range of promoters.
Rift Valley fever ( RVF ) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 2008–2009, a RVF outbreak affected the whole Madagascar island, including the Anjozorobe district located in Madagascar highlands. An entomological survey showed the absence of Aedes among the potential RVF virus ( RVFV ) vector species identified in this area, and an overall low abundance of mosquitoes due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological nor virological sign of infection was observed in wild terrestrial mammals of the area, suggesting an absence of wild RVF virus ( RVFV ) reservoir. However, a three years serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed a recurrent RVFV circulation. To understand the key determinants of this unexpected recurrent transmission, a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed and parameterized to reproduce the local conditions using observational data collected in the area. Three scenarios that could explain the RVFV recurrent circulation in the area were analyzed: ( i ) RVFV overwintering thanks to a direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, vectors being absent during the winter, ( ii ) a low level vector-based circulation during winter thanks to a residual vector population, without direct transmission between cattle, ( iii ) combination of both above mentioned mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced field observations, 84% of cattle infections being attributed to vector-borne transmission, and 16% to direct transmission.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive and aggressive daytime-biting mosquito that is a major public health threat throughout its expanding range. We used 13 nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial COI sequences to investigate the historical and contemporary movements of Ae. albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region and to characterize its population structure. Our results show that Ae. albopictus was most likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Southeast Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or Southeast Asia. We also found that the recent incursion into northern Australia’s Torres Strait Islands was seeded chiefly from Indonesia. For the first time, we provide evidence of a recently colonized population ( the Torres Strait Islands ) that has undergone rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be the result of genetic drift or represent a secondary invasion from an unknown source. The species’ genetic structure in the region tends to favour a dispersal pattern driven mostly by human movements. Our study provides a more widespread sampling distribution of the species’ native range, revealing more spatial population structure than previously shown.
Infection with Schistosoma mansoni has been shown to have a negative impact on the quality of life of schoolchildren in Mwanza Region, North-Western Tanzania. A cross-sectional study of 572 schoolchildren aged 7–8 years found that 58. 7% were infected with S. mansoni, with 56. 5% having light infections and 16. 4% having heavy infections. The prevalence of anaemia was 30. 1% and stunting and wasting were found in less than 10% of the population. However, there was no association between S. mansoni infection and anthropometry, anaemia, liver or spleen pathology. In contrast, S. mansoni infection was found to have a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, as measured by the PedsQL tool. Children with S. mansoni infection had a lower score in emotional PedsQL compared to uninfected children. However, there was no association between S. mansoni infection and physical fitness, as measured by VO2 max. In multivariable linear regression analyses, age, S. mansoni infection, haemoglobin and VO2 max were significant predictors for emotional PedsQL, while physical PedsQL, height, age and haemoglobin were significant predictors for VO2 max.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the spirochete Leptospira, with wild rodents, such as the brown rat ( Rattus norvegicus ), serving as the main reservoir. Experimental studies of Leptospira infection in rats have traditionally used an intraperitoneal inoculation route, which is not a natural route of infection. We investigated the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation routes compared to the intraperitoneal route on Leptospira infection in adult rats. Leptospira infection was asymptomatic and caused similar antibody production regardless of the inoculation route. The observed renal colonization rates were 8 out of 8 rats, 5 out of 8 rats, and 1 out of 8 rats for the intraperitoneal, mucosal, and subcutaneous inoculation routes, respectively. Among the natural infection routes studied, mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization associated with urinary excretion than the subcutaneous route and induced a slower-progressing infection than the intraperitoneal route. These results can facilitate understanding of the infection modalities in rats, unlike the epidemiological studies conducted in wild rats.
Sepsis is a life-threatening disease characterized by excessive inflammatory responses, severe tissue injury, organ dysfunction, and ultimately, mortality. In this study, we identify a novel role for Annexin A2 ( AnxA2 ) in modulating the inflammatory response during polymicrobial sepsis. AnxA2 is a multi-compartmental protein involved in diverse cellular processes, including regulation of innate immunity, endosome function, and inflammation. We show that AnxA2 functions as a putative reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) inhibitor in sepsis progression, and that cysteine 9 of AnxA2 is the most important amino acid for oxidation regulation. In sepsis models, AnxA2 deficient mice ( anxa2-/- ) manifested increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, decreased bacterial clearance, and impaired survival. Furthermore, AnxA2 deficiency led to increased levels of ROS and IL-17A, a pro-inflammatory cytokine. We found that ROS is responsible for elevated IL-17A levels and subsequently exaggerated inflammatory response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas9 KO strategy down-regulated inflammation and conferred protection against sepsis in anxa2-/- mice. Our findings reveal a previously undemonstrated function for AnxA2 in inflammatory response in polymicrobial sepsis models via an AnxA2-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing insight into the regulation of pathophysiology of sepsis.
HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a key role in viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Polyinosine-polycytidylic acid ( poly ( I∶C ) ), a synthetic analog of dsRNA, and bacterial lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), the ligands for Toll-like receptors ( TLR ) TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, are known to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDMs ). We found that poly ( I∶C ) - and LPS-stimulation of MDMs abrogated infection by CCR5-using, macrophage-tropic HIV-1, and by vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped HIV-1 virions. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD4 or CCR5 expression, type I interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Using microarray analysis and quantitative reverse transcription ( RT ) -PCR, we found increased microRNA ( miR ) -155 levels in MDMs upon TLR3/4- but not TLR7-stimulation, and a miR-155 specific inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly ( I∶C ) -stimulated MDMs. Ectopic miR-155 expression remarkably diminished HIV-1 infection in primary MDMs and cell lines. Our findings provide evidence that miR-155 exerts an anti-HIV-1 effect by targeting several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to severely diminished HIV-1 infection.
Most organisms use daily light/dark cycles as timing cues to control many essential physiological processes. In plants, growth rates of the embryonic stem ( hypocotyl ) are maximal at different times of day, depending on external photoperiod and the internal circadian clock. To determine the transcriptional component associated with the rhythmic control of growth, we applied temporal analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana seedling transcriptome under multiple growth conditions and mutant backgrounds using DNA microarrays. We show that a group of plant hormone-associated genes are coexpressed at the time of day when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal. This expression correlates with overrepresentation of a cis-acting element ( CACATG ) in phytohormone gene promoters, which is sufficient to confer the predicted diurnal and circadian expression patterns in vivo. Using circadian clock and light signaling mutants, we show that both internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity and external coincidence with darkness are required to coordinate wild-type growth. We argue that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive gating of light-mediated phytohormone transcript levels to the proper time of day. This temporal integration of hormone pathways allows plants to fine tune phytohormone responses for seasonal and shade-appropriate growth regulation.
Rhodnius prolixus, the primary vector of Chagas disease, can be controlled by modifying its gut microbiota to induce systemic RNA interference ( RNAi ). Here, we show that feeding R. prolixus nymphs and adults with Escherichia coli HT115 ( DE3 ) expressing double-stranded RNA ( dsRNA ) for the Rhodnius heme-binding protein ( RHBP ) and catalase ( CAT ) results in systemic and temporal RNAi effects. RHBP is an egg protein and CAT is an antioxidant enzyme expressed in all tissues by all developmental stages. We found that concentrations of E. coli HT115 ( DE3 ) above 3. 35 × 107 CFU/mL produced a significant RHBP and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and adults. RHBP expression in the fat body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after feeding. CAT expression was reduced by 99% and 96% in the ovary and the posterior midgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. We also found that feeding females 105 CFU/mL of the natural symbiont, Rhodococcus rhodnii, transformed to express RHBP-specific hairpin RNA reduced RHBP expression by 89% and reduced oviposition. These results suggest that modifying the insect microbiota to induce systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may result in a paratransgenic strategy for sustainable vector control.
Malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border, accounting for 55. 5% of all febrile illnesses in a cohort of 409 pregnant women. Arthropod-borne diseases, including malaria, rickettsial infections, and dengue, as well as zoonotic diseases, such as leptospirosis, accounted for nearly half of all febrile illnesses in pregnant women. Pyelonephritis was also a common cause of fever, occurring in 19. 7% of febrile women. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight. Fever in pregnancy increases the risk of maternal death and infant morbidity and mortality, and is associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, stillbirth, and premature delivery. Despite the marked reduction in malaria incidence on the western border of Thailand, malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy in this low transmission area.
The relationship between maternal age and recombination rate in humans has been examined in a study of 69 French-Canadian pedigrees. Using over 600, 000 genotyped markers, we localized recombination events in 195 maternal meioses and observed a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age. This effect appears to be localized in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions, and is likely driven by chromosome-specific effects. We propose a model that reconciles our findings with reported associations between maternal age and recombination in cases of trisomies. The most important factor linked to chromosomal aneuploidy in women is advancing maternal age, and it remains important to establish associations between patterns of recombination and maternal age in normal meioses. Our results support the hypothesis that chromosome-specific effects may be critical determinants of the complex relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans. The decay in crossovers with maternal age appears to be localized in specific portions of chromosomal arms, with a significant reduction in recombination rates observed for older mothers in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions.
Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes severe disease in immunocompromised patients. Developing vaccines against this pathogen is challenging, as patients most at risk of developing disease are deficient in aspects of the adaptive immune system. Here, we present a novel approach to induce innate memory in macrophages in vivo, which provides complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. Macrophages were primed in vivo with Cryptococcus neoformans and interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ), resulting in a rapid up-regulation of IFN-γ and STAT1 signaling pathways following secondary challenge. The enhanced cytokine recall responses were pathogen-specific, dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation, and correlated with increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with protective anti-fungal immunity. Thus, we demonstrate an alternative mechanism to induce macrophage innate memory in vivo that facilitates pathogen-specific vaccine-mediated immune responses. This concept suggests that immunization strategies that drive memory-like innate immune responses may provide a novel and effective mechanism for inducing vaccine-mediated protection in immunocompromised patients. Our data show that in vivo IFN-γ priming of macrophages can extend the memory-like phenotype for weeks, providing protection against subsequent infection.
Polycomb repressive complexes ( PRCs ) play a crucial role in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in both plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, depletion of different members of PRCs causes both overlapping and unique phenotypic defects. Here, we show that CURLY LEAF ( CLF ), a major catalytic subunit of PRC2, coordinates with different members of PRC1 in suppression of distinct plant developmental programs. We found that expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings preferentially via non-redundant role of CLF, which specifically associates with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 ( LHP1 ). In contrast, expression of embryo development genes is repressed by PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 in common with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER ( SWN ). This context-dependent role of CLF corresponds well with the change in H3K27me3 profiles, and is remarkably associated with differential co-occupancy of binding motifs of transcription factors ( TFs ), including MADS box and ABA-related factors. We propose that different combinations of PRC members distinctively regulate different developmental programs, and their target specificity is modulated by specific TFs.
RNA polymerase II is a multisubunit enzyme responsible for transcription in eukaryotic cells. Its active site contains a “trigger loop” ( TL ) that plays a crucial role in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. To understand the function of the TL, we have quantitatively phenotyped nearly all TL single variants of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II at individual-residue resolution. We have identified three mutant classes with distinct distributions among TL residues that are linked to transcription defects or various stresses. Mutations disrupting an intra-TL hydrophobic pocket confer phenotypes consistent with pocket disruption and increased catalysis. Furthermore, we have identified allele-specific genetic interactions among TL and TL-proximal domain residues that support the contribution of the funnel and bridge helices ( BH ) to TL dynamics. Our structural genetics approach incorporates structural and phenotypic data for high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and their evolution. This approach is readily applicable to other essential yeast proteins and expands the current scope of existing deep mutational scanning studies. Our data indicate that both intra-TL interactions and TL interactions with nearby domains are critical for TL function. We have identified many more predicted gain-of-function and loss-of-function TL variants, some of which are predicted to confer epistatic interactions.
Rabies virus ( RV ) is the causative agent of a fatal central nervous system ( CNS ) disease in mammals. The virus is usually transmitted by bites or scratches from rabid animals, resulting in the dissemination of virions into skin and muscle tissue. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the pathogenetic relevance of hematogenous RV spread. We infected mice intramuscularly ( i. m. ) or intravenously ( i. v. ) with the dog-associated RV strain DOG4 or the silver-haired bat-associated RV strain SB to determine whether certain RV variants might have the capacity to invade the CNS from the periphery via hematogenous spread. In contrast to i. m. infection where both variants caused a lethal encephalopathy, only i. v. infection with SB resulted in the development of a lethal infection. Our data suggest that hematogenous spread of SB can lead to a fatal encephalopathy through direct retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that only i. v. administered SB directly infected the forebrain, with the earliest affected regions being those hypothalamic nuclei connected by neurosecretory fibers to the circumventricular organs neurohypophysis and median eminence. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for the post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat-associated RV.
Since 1918, the H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans. The evolutionary history of the A/H1N1 virus is not well understood, particularly the virological basis for several notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. Using a data set of 71 representative complete genome sequences sampled between 1918 and 2006, we show that segmental reassortment has played an important role in the genomic evolution of A/H1N1 since 1918. Specifically, we demonstrate that an A/H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, which may explain the abrupt antigenic evolution of this virus. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may also have been associated with reassortant A/H1N1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassortment appears to be a more important process in the evolution and epidemiology of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously realized.
Nicotine exerts its reinforcing action by stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs ) and boosting dopamine ( DA ) output from the ventral tegmental area ( VTA ). Recent data have led to a debate about the principal pathway of nicotine action: direct stimulation of the DAergic cells through nAChR activation, or disinhibition mediated through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons. We use a computational model of the VTA circuitry and nAChR function to shed light on this issue. Our model illustrates that the α4β2-containing nAChRs either on DA or GABA cells can mediate the acute effects of nicotine. We account for in vitro as well as in vivo data, and predict the conditions necessary for either direct stimulation or disinhibition to be at the origin of DA activity increases. We propose key experiments to disentangle the contribution of both mechanisms. We show that the rate of endogenous acetylcholine input crucially determines the evoked DA response for both mechanisms. Together our results delineate the mechanisms by which the VTA mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and suggest an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) is a chronic skin disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by sand fly vectors. In Afghanistan, Leishmania ( L. ) major and L. tropica are the principal causative species. A randomized, double-blinded, phase IIa trial was conducted in Kabul from 2004 to 2008 to evaluate a novel therapeutic concept to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve the cosmetic outcome of CL. Patients suffering from L. tropica CL were treated with bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization ( EC ) followed by daily moist-wound-treatment ( MWT ) with polyacrylate hydrogel with ( group I ) or without ( group II ) pharmaceutical sodium chlorite ( DAC N-055 ). Patients below age 5, with facial lesions, pregnancy, or serious comorbidities were excluded. The primary outcome was the time needed for complete lesion epithelialization. The mean duration for complete wound closure was 43. 1 days in group I and 42 days in group II ( p = 0. 83 ). In patients with Leishmania-positive 2nd biopsies, DAC N-055 caused a more rapid wound epithelialization ( 37. 2 days vs. 58. 3 days; p = 0. 08 ). Superinfections occurred in both groups at the same rate ( 8. 8% ). In vitro, DAC N-055 showed a leishmanicidal effect on pro- and amastigotes. Compared to previous results with intralesional antimony injections, the EC plus MWT protocol led to more rapid wound closure.
RAS is one of the most prevalent oncogenes, and the RAF-MEK-MAPK module is the main conduit through which RAS transmits proliferative signals in normal and cancer cells. To obtain a comprehensive view of the elements functionally linked to the RAS/MAPK cascade, we used a quantitative assay in Drosophila S2 cells to conduct a genome-wide RNAi screen for factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation. The screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known factors associated with this pathway. Epistasis experiments were carried out on individual candidates to determine their position relative to core pathway components. We found that most hits unexpectedly work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors and suggest that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. We further characterized two representative members of this group and found that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila.
Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are two species of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex that cause cryptococcosis in humans and animals. A retrospective study of 498 isolates from clinical, environmental, and veterinary sources in Thailand was conducted to gain a more detailed picture of cryptococcosis in the country. The majority of the isolates ( 68. 9% ) were from males with a mean age of 37. 97 years, and 88. 5% of Cryptococcus neoformans and 37. 5% of Cryptococcus gattii isolates were from HIV patients. The majority of the isolates ( 94. 8% ) were Cryptococcus neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their source. Multilocus Sequence Type ( MLST ) analysis identified a total of 20 sequence types ( ST ) in Thailand, with ST30 for Cryptococcus gattii and ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172, and ST173 for Cryptococcus neoformans being unique to Thailand. Most of the Cryptococcus gattii isolates were ST7 = VGIIb, which is identical to the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone in the global spread of this outbreak strain. The current study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types being present amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.
The evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks is a major source of phenotypic variation across organisms. While changes to cis-regulatory elements are thought to be the predominant means by which regulatory networks evolve, examples of regulatory network divergence due to transcription factor ( TF ) variation have also been observed. We analyzed the evolution of the largest class of metazoan TFs, Cys2-His2 zinc finger ( C2H2-ZF ) TFs, across 12 Drosophila species spanning ~45 million years of evolution. We found that a significant fraction of all C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs in flies exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. In addition to loss and recruitment of C2H2-ZF domains, we found diverging DNA-contacting residues in ~44% of domains shared between D. melanogaster and the other fly species. These variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of D. melanogaster flies, indicating their rapid fixation. The predicted specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Our work suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans.
Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A are the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers. The development of serotype-specific PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) assays is required to accelerate diagnosis and overcome the lack of typing sera and the need for culture in some situations. However, the sensitivity and specificity of such assays must be demonstrated on large collections of strains representative of the targeted serotypes and all other bacterial populations producing similar clinical symptoms. Here, we describe the development of serotype-specific PCR assays for serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A using a new family of repeated DNA sequences, CRISPR ( clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats ), as a serotype-specific target. We developed a conventional multiplex PCR assay for the detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A from cultured isolates, as well as EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex PCR assays with the same two sets of primers. We achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity for each protocol after validation of the assays on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 serotype Paratyphi A strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins and time periods, and on 70 strains of bacteria frequently encountered in bloodstream infections, including 29 other Salmonella serotypes and 42 strains from 38 other bacterial species. Our serotype-specific PCR assays should facilitate the rapid and accurate identification of these two major serotypes in a large range of clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology.
Leishmania major is an intracellular protozoan parasite that causes cutaneous leishmaniasis. The protective immune response to this parasite involves the differentiation of IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T helper 1 ( Th1 ) cells. Notch receptors are known to regulate cell differentiation during development, but their role in the polarization of peripheral CD4+ T helper 1 cells is not well understood. Here, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in Th1 cell differentiation following infection with L. major. Mice with T cell-specific gene ablation of Notch1 ( N1 ), Notch2 ( N2 ), or both ( N1N2ΔCD4Cre ) were infected with L. major. Mice lacking both N1 and N2 ( N1N2ΔCD4Cre ) developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia. In contrast, mice with single inactivation of N1 or N2 ( N1ΔCD4Cre or N2ΔCD4Cre ) were resistant to infection and developed a protective Th1 immune response. We show that Notch signaling through either N1 and/or N2 induces the secretion of IFNγ by CD4+ Th1 cells. This effect is independent of CSL/RBP-Jκ, the major effector of Notch receptors, since L. major-infected mice with a RBP-Jκ deletion in their T cells were able to develop IFNγ-secreting Th1 cells.
Schistosoma mansoni infection significantly increases susceptibility to systemic SHIV clade C infection in rhesus macaques after mucosal virus exposure. This is the first direct evidence showing that helminth infection increases host susceptibility to mucosal AIDS virus transmission in primates. Systemic infection of S. mansoni-infected rhesus macaques was established by low doses of virus that remained sub-infectious in parasite-free hosts. The 50% animal infectious ( AID50 ) SHIV-C dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls ( P<0. 001 ). Coinfected animals also had significantly higher peak viral RNA loads than controls ( P<0. 001 ), as well as increased viral replication in CD4+ central memory cells ( P = 0. 03 ). This increased susceptibility to mucosal immunodeficiency virus transmission, elevated viral replication in coinfected hosts, and accelerated loss of memory T cells have profound public health implications for areas of the world where both parasitic worms and HIV-1 are endemic. Our data support the suggestion that better control of helminth infections may favorably impact efforts to reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS.
Acetylcholine ( ACh ) is a neurotransmitter that plays a key role in regulating neural excitability and sleep-wake states. In the cortex, ACh modulates neural excitability by reducing spike-frequency adaptation ( SFA ) and shifting the phase response curve ( PRC ). We present a biophysical model of a cortical network composed of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons with a M-current regulated by ACh. Our results show that changes in neural excitability and network structure interact to create three distinct functional regimes: localized asynchronous, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous patterns of activity. These regimes are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations of cortical activity during slow wave sleep ( SWS ), REM sleep, and waking states. During SWS, traveling patterns of activity occur in the cortex, while in other states, stationary patterns are observed. We show that the level of ACh determines how sensitive network activity is to synaptic heterogeneity and that ACh induced changes in SFA level and PRC shape occur over differing values of gKs¯. Our results indicate that ACh mediated SFA can induce large scale spatio-temporal dynamics and that neural networks composed of highly excitable cells will be more responsive to synaptic heterogeneities.
Esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) develops in an inflammatory microenvironment with reduced microbial diversity. We investigated the role of mutations in the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) signaling pathway in the development of EAC. We interrogated whole genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and found that non-synonymous mutations affected the TLR pathway in 25/171 ( 14. 6% ) tumors. TLR mutant cases were associated with more proximal tumors and metastatic disease. We validated our findings in an external EAC dataset with non-synonymous TLR pathway mutations in 33/149 ( 22. 1% ) tumors. TLR4 was the most frequently mutated gene with eleven mutations in 10/171 ( 5. 8% ) of EAC tumors. The TLR4 mutants E439G, S570I, F703C and R787H were confirmed to have impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide with marked reductions in signaling by luciferase reporter assays. In addition to EAC, TLR pathway mutations were frequently observed in solid tumors arising in body sites exposed to microbiota, including colorectal adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, uterine endometrioid carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma. Overall, our findings show that TLR pathway genes are recurrently mutated in EAC, and TLR4 mutations have decreased responsiveness to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients.
Taste cell differentiation is a critical process in the development of the sense of taste, which is essential for animal survival. Although the mechanisms of taste signal transduction are well understood, the ontogeny of taste cells remains largely unknown. We used a novel approach to investigate the molecular regulation of taste system development in mice by combining in silico and in vivo analyses. We discovered that taste receptor calcium signaling molecules ( TRCSMs ) colocalized within developing circumvallate papillae ( CVP ), and used computational analysis to investigate the possibility of a common regulatory network for TRCSM transcription. We identified Hes1 as a likely common regulatory factor and examined its function in vivo. Expression profile analyses revealed that decreased expression of nuclear HES1 correlated with expression of type II taste cell markers. After stage E18, the CVP of Hes1−/− mutants displayed over 5-fold more TRCSM-immunoreactive cells than did the CVP of their wild-type littermates. Thus, according to our composite analyses, Hes1 is likely to play a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds.
Ethylene and auxin play important roles in regulating root growth and development in plants. In Arabidopsis, ethylene and auxin act synergistically to inhibit root elongation. However, the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice is still unclear. Here, we report that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid ( IPA ) -dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice. We showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. We identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in YUC8/REIN7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while YUC8/REIN7 overexpression enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. Moreover, YUC8/REIN7 catalyzed the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid ( IAA ), and a truncated version of YUC8/REIN7 resulted in significant reduction of enzymatic activity. We further showed that ethylene induced YUC8/REIN7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots. Addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1, strongly demonstrating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis.
The first nationwide epidemiological study on non-tuberculous mycobacterial ( NTM ) diseases in Saudi Arabia was conducted to investigate the current epidemiologic situation in the country. A total of 527 NTM isolates with clinical and demographical data were collected over a period of 24 months. Primary species identification was carried out by line probe assays followed by sequencing of 16S rRNA, 16S-23S ITS region, rpoB and hsp65 genes. The study revealed a higher proportion of Saudi citizens ( 76. 5% ), elderly ( >60 years ) patients ( 34. 2% ), and male gender ( 65. 3% ). Overall, 75. 1% of the isolates were of pulmonary origin with a proven clinical significance of 44. 7%. A total of 34 NTM species, including 17 rare species, were identified, in addition to 8 ‘undefined’ isolates. M. simiae ( 22. 6% ), M. fortuitum ( 18. 1% ) and M. abscessus ( 17. 8% ) were the predominant species. Interestingly, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M. riyadhense were identified. The study also revealed rare clinical events such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis and ascites caused by M. wolinskyi, M. holsaticum, M. duvalii and M. monacence respectively. Diabetes mellitus and previous history of tuberculosis were identified as independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases.
Quiescence entry and chronological lifespan ( CLS ) extension in yeast are dependent on the accumulation of storage carbohydrates mediated by the kinases Yak1, Mck1 and Rim15. Upon starvation for glucose or other macronutrients, yeast cells exit the mitotic cell cycle and acquire characteristics specific to quiescent cells to ensure longevity. We screened a subset of the yeast deletion library representing genes encoding ‘signaling’ proteins and found that Rim15, Mck1 and Yak1 kinases, the SNF1/AMPK complex, the cell wall integrity pathway and cell cycle regulators are necessary for proper quiescence establishment and CLS extension. The CLS of these signaling mutants correlates well with the amount of storage carbohydrates but poorly with transition-phase cell cycle status. The combined removal of glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes severely reduces CLS, while overexpression of these genes or supplementation of trehalose to the growth medium rescues the defects of quiescence exit exhibited by the signaling mutants.
Influenza A virus hemagglutinin glycosylation has been found to compensate for fitness costs resulting from escape from anti-hemagglutinin ( HA ) neutralizing antibodies. Using the primerID method of error-correcting viral population sequencing, we reveal that the addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain can modulate receptor binding avidity and increase the fitness of antigenic escape variants in the absence of antibody selective pressure. This finding expands our understanding of the viral mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigenic evolution and sheds light on the unique mutational plasticity of influenza HA. Our results indicate that glycosylation can play an important role in compensating for the fitness costs imposed by escape substitutions elsewhere on HA, thus increasing the viability and emergence potential of antibody-escape variants. Furthermore, we show that glycosylation can also play the opposite role during antigenic drift, increasing the fitness of antigenic escape variants by restoring optimal HA receptor interactions. This raises the possibility that both mechanisms contribute to the steady evolutionary accretion of N-linked glycans within the globular domain observed during human circulation of H1 and H3 viruses. Our findings highlight the power of virus population sequencing for uncovering novel mechanisms of viral adaptation through high-definition forward genetics screening.
Reverse rate dependence is a problematic property of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the cardiac action potential ( AP ). This property results in reduced arrhythmia suppression at fast heart rates and increased arrhythmia risk at slow heart rates. We have addressed the possibility of forward rate dependence by performing a comprehensive analysis of 13 ventricular myocyte models. By simulating populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzing population results statistically, we simultaneously predicted the rate-dependent effects of changes in multiple model parameters. An average of 40 parameters were tested in each model, and effects on AP duration were assessed at slow ( 0. 2 Hz ) and fast ( 2 Hz ) rates. The analysis identified a variety of forward rate dependent ( FRD ) ionic current perturbations and generated specific predictions regarding their mechanisms. For instance, an increase in L-type calcium current is FRD when this is accompanied by indirect, rate-dependent changes in slow delayed rectifier potassium current. A comparison of predictions across models identified inward rectifier potassium current and the sodium-potassium pump as the two targets most likely to produce FRD AP prolongation. Finally, a statistical analysis of results from the 13 models demonstrated that models displaying minimal rate-dependent changes in AP shape have little capacity for FRD perturbations, whereas models with large shape changes have considerable FRD potential.
Phenome-Wide Association Studies ( PheWAS ) are used to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms associated with a phenotype are also associated with other diagnoses. In this study, we have developed new methods to perform a PheWAS based on ICD-10 codes and biological test results, and to use a quantitative trait as the selection criterion. We tested our approach on thiopurine S-methyltransferase ( TPMT ) activity in patients treated by thiopurine drugs. We developed two aggregation methods for the ICD-10 codes: an ICD-10 hierarchy and a mapping to existing ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes. We also analyzed eleven biological test results using discretization algorithms. We applied these methods in patients having a TPMT activity assessment from the clinical data warehouse of a French academic hospital between January 2000 and July 2013. A total of 442 patient records were analyzed representing 10, 252 ICD-10 codes and 72, 711 biological test results. The results from the ICD-9-CM based PheWAS codes and ICD-10 hierarchy codes were concordant. Cross-validation with the biological test results allowed us to validate the ICD phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus were associated with a very high TPMT activity. We describe here an original method to perform PheWAS on a quantitative trait using both ICD-10 diagnosis codes and biological test results to identify associated phenotypes. In the field of pharmacogenomics, PheWAS allow for the identification of new subgroups of patients who require personalized clinical and therapeutic management.
Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) is a devastating condition for which no treatments are currently available. Stem cells offer some promise in the restoration of neurological function. We conducted a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression to study the impact of stem cell biology and experimental design on motor and sensory outcomes following stem cell treatments in animal models of SCI. We found that allogeneic stem cell treatment appears to improve both motor ( effect size, 27. 2%, 95% CI, 25. 0%–29. 4%, 312 comparisons in 5, 628 animals ) and sensory ( effect size, 26. 3%, 95% CI, 7. 9%–44. 7%, 23 comparisons in 473 animals ) outcomes. For sensory outcome, most heterogeneity between experiments was accounted for by facets of stem cell biology. Differentiation before implantation and intravenous route of delivery favoured better outcome. However, stem cell implantation did not appear to improve sensory outcome in female animals and appeared to be enhanced by isoflurane anaesthesia. For motor outcome, facets of stem cell biology had little detectable effect. Instead, most heterogeneity could be explained by the experimental modelling and the outcome measure used. The location of injury, method of injury induction, and presence of immunosuppression all had an impact.
Soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections, including Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect more than a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy, which involves repeated administration of anthelmintic drugs to at-risk populations, is the mainstay of control. However, this strategy does not prevent reinfection. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after drug treatment. We analyzed data from 51 studies and found that at 3, 6, and 12 months posttreatment, the prevalence of A. lumbricoides reinfection reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. For T. trichiura, the respective reinfection prevalence were 36%, 67%, and 82%, and for hookworm, 30%, 55%, and 57%. We also found that the prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pretreatment infection status. Our results suggest that STH reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura. Therefore, there is a need for frequent anthelmintic drug administrations to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) is a spectrum of metabolic syndromes ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To understand the deregulation of metabolic processes that give rise to these phenotypes, we propose a method called Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis ( MiNEA ). MiNEA is applied to genome-scale metabolic networks ( GEMs ) to generate all possible alternative minimal networks ( MiNs ) that can synthesize a target metabolite. We applied MiNEA to investigate deregulated MiNs and identify key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes, such as fatty liver and liver inflammation, in both humans and mice by integrating condition-specific transcriptomics data from liver samples. We identified key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both humans and mice, and found that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice. We further identified which MiNs demonstrate the general and specific characteristics of the different NAFLD phenotypes. MiNEA is applicable to any GEM and to any desired target metabolite, making it flexible enough to study condition-specific metabolism for any given disease or organism.
The olfactory system faces the challenge of identifying an enormous variety of odors independent of their intensity. We show that primacy coding, where the odor identity is encoded by the receptor types that respond earliest, provides a compact and informative representation that can be interpreted efficiently by the brain. We analyze the information transmitted by a simple model of primacy coding using numerical simulations and statistical descriptions. We show that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included in the primacy representation, but only weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of the odor intensity and the transmitted information is useful to perform typical olfactory tasks with close to experimentally measured performance. Interestingly, we find situations in which a smaller receptor repertoire is advantageous for discriminating odors. We show that primacy coding provides a robust and compact representation of the odor identity over a wide range of odors, independent of the odor intensity, and that it outperforms other simple coding schemes. Our results suggest that the primacy code formed in the olfactory bulb is more useful to identify odors in the subsequent olfactory cortex than simple alternatives.
HIV broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies ( bnMAbs ) have been shown to occasionally display non-sigmoidal neutralization curves that plateau at less than 100% neutralization. In this study, we investigated the extent of non-sigmoidal slopes and plateaus at less than 100% for HIV bnMAbs targeting the four best-studied regions of the Env spike involved in broad neutralization. Using a panel of 278 pseudoviruses in a CD4 T-cell assay and a panel of 117 viruses in the TZM-bl assay, we found that bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex of Env and gp41 were most likely to show neutralization curves that plateaued at less than 100%. Conversely, bnMAbs targeting the high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to show such behavior. We also found that two CD4 binding site ( CD4bs ) Abs showed this behavior relatively infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was also observed in a large peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) -grown molecular virus clone panel derived from patient viral swarms. In addition, five bnMAbs were compared against an 18-virus panel of molecular clones produced in 293T cells and PBMCs and assayed in TZM-bl cells, and examples of plateaus at less than 90% were seen with both types of virus production.
Cancer cells exhibit several metabolic traits, including aerobic production of lactate from glucose ( Warburg effect ), extensive glutamine utilization, and impaired mitochondrial electron flow. To understand how these metabolic rearrangements contribute to cancer cell proliferation, we performed systematic constraint-based simulations of a model of human central metabolism. We sampled the feasible flux space to obtain a large number of randomly mutated cells simulated at different glutamine and glucose uptake rates. We observed that, in the limited subset of proliferating cells, most displayed fermentation of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high utilization rates of glutamine, oxidative utilization of glucose was decreased, while the production of lactate from glutamine was enhanced. This emergent phenotype was observed only when the available carbon exceeded the amount that could be fully oxidized by the available oxygen. Under these conditions, Flux Balance Analysis indicated that this metabolic pattern is optimal to maximize biomass and ATP production. It requires the activity of a branched TCA cycle, in which glutamine-dependent reductive carboxylation cooperates to the production of lipids and proteins, and is sustained by a variety of redox-controlled metabolic reactions.
Cellular prion protein ( PrPC ) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel ( Prnd ) and Shadoo ( Sprn ), were investigated in a cell culture model permissive to prion replication. A quantitative investigation of the PrPC interactome was conducted in neuroblastoma cells and extended to Prnd and Sprn to facilitate recognition of relevant interactors. The study established a similar physiological environment for the three prion protein family members in neuroblastoma cells and suggested direct interactions amongst them. Multiple interactions between PrPC and the neural cell adhesion molecule, the laminin receptor precursor, Na/K ATPases and protein disulfide isomerases ( PDI ) were confirmed. Subsequent validation experiments established that interactions of PrPC with PDIs may extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and may play a hitherto unrecognized role in the accumulation of PrPSc. A simple hypothesis was presented which accounts for the majority of interactions observed in uninfected cells and suggests that PrPC organizes its molecular environment on account of its ability to bind to adhesion molecules harboring immunoglobulin-like domains, which in turn recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. The study suggests that members of the mammalian prion protein family may be embedded in specialized membrane domains characterized by an extended molecular network which supports functions in adhesion control, lactate metabolism and cell fusion events.
Respiratory virus infections, such as influenza, typically induce a robust type I immune response. However, the production of type 2 cytokines, such as interleukin ( IL ) -5, has been observed. IL-5 is a prototypical type 2 cytokine that is essential for eosinophil maturation and egress out of the bone marrow. Using a mouse model of influenza virus infection, we found a robust transient release of IL-5 into infected airways along with a significant and progressive accumulation of eosinophils into the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase of infection. The cellular source of the IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2 ) infiltrating the infected lungs. Interestingly, the progressive accumulation of eosinophils following virus clearance is reflected in the rapid expansion of c-kit+ IL-5 producing ILC2. We further demonstrate that the enhanced capacity for IL-5 production by ILC2 during recovery is concomitant with the enhanced expression of the IL-33 receptor subunit, ST2, by ILC2. Lastly, we show that NKT cells, as well as alveolar macrophages ( AM ), are endogenous sources of IL-33 that enhance IL-5 production from ILC2. Collectively, these results reveal that c-kit+ ILC2 interaction with IL-33 producing NKT and AM leads to abundant production of IL-5 by ILC2 and accounts for the accumulation of eosinophils observed during the recovery phase of influenza infection.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of iNTS disease in Asia are not well documented. This study retrospectively identified 102 cases of iNTS infections in an infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. The majority of patients ( 71% ) were HIV-infected, >90% were adults, 71% were male, and 33% reported intravenous drug use. The most commonly identified serovars were S. Enteritidis ( ST11 ) and S. Typhimurium ( STs 19, 34 and 1544 ), which were responsible for 43% and 30% of all cases, respectively. S. Typhimurium was identified more frequently in HIV-infected patients ( p = 0. 003 ). HIV infection was significantly associated with death ( p = 0. 039 ), with a mortality rate of 28%. Isolates from HIV-infected patients were more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility against trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole than HIV-negative patients ( p = 0. 037 ). We conclude that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam with a high mortality rate.
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and play a crucial role in the survival and pathogenicity of their hosts, as well as in nutrient redistribution via cell lysis and lysogenic conversion factors. However, over 70% of phage open reading frames ( ORFs ) are dissimilar to any genes with annotated functions in GenBank, making their identification challenging. To address this issue, we have developed a computational method to predict phage structural protein sequences using Artificial Neural Networks ( ANNs ). We first trained ANNs to classify viral structural proteins using amino acid frequency, which correctly classified a large fraction of test cases with a high degree of specificity and sensitivity. We then added estimates of protein isoelectric points as a feature to ANNs that classify specialized families of proteins, namely major capsid and tail proteins. These more specialized ANNs were more accurate than the structural ANNs. We experimentally validated the ANN predictions by examining several ORFs with no significant similarities to known sequences that were predicted to be structural proteins by transmission electron microscopy. Some of these ORFs self-assembled into structures strongly resembling virion structures. Our ANNs are new tools for identifying phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis.
Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) is one of the few oncogenic human viruses known to date. KSHV ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family, but the function of ORF20 and its role in the viral life cycle is not well understood. Here, we show that ORF20 interacts with the interferon-stimulated gene product ( ISG ) oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein ( OASL ). This interaction is conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses. Characterization of OASL interacting partners by quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry ( q-AP-MS ) identified a very similar interactome to that of ORF20. Both ORF20 and OASL copurified with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, and when they were co-expressed, they associated with polysomes. Although ORF20 did not have a global effect on translation, ORF20 enhanced RIG-I induced expression of endogenous OASL in an IRF3-dependent but IFNAR-independent manner. OASL has been characterized as an ISG with antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role for gammaherpesviruses was unknown. We show that OASL and ORF20 mRNA expression were induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuARLT-rKSHV. 219 cells. Intriguingly, we found that OASL enhanced infection of KSHV. During infection with a KSHV ORF20stop mutant, however, OASL-dependent enhancement of infectivity was lost. Our data have characterized the interaction of ORF20 with OASL and suggest ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection.
Lassa virus disease ( LVD ) is an important cause of fever, including undifferentiated fever, in children in endemic areas of Nigeria. However, it is not significantly associated with convulsions in febrile children. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and presentation of LVD in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. We conducted a prospective study of consecutive febrile children aged ≥1 month–15 years admitted to the Children’s Emergency Room of Irrua Specialist Teaching Hospital over a period of 1 year. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 ( 3. 5% ) in febrile admissions, 3/108 ( 2. 8% ) in children with convulsions, and 10/265 ( 3. 8% ) in children without convulsions. Only vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD. The prevalence of LVD and its lack of clinical differentiation on presentation underscore the importance of a high index of suspicion in diagnosis. Screening of febrile children with undifferentiated fever in endemic areas for LVD could be an important medical and public health control measure.
Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism for plant biology, has been used to identify new factors that regulate drought resistance. We found that mutations in the KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 ( KAI2 ) gene, which encodes the proposed karrikin receptor, result in hypersensitivity to water deprivation. This suggests that KAI2 plays a positive role in regulating drought resistance in Arabidopsis. We performed transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses of kai2 mutants to understand the basis for KAI2-regulated drought resistance. We found that kai2 mutants have increased rates of water loss, drought-induced cell membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, and higher cuticular permeability. In addition, kai2 plants have reduced anthocyanin biosynthesis during drought and are hyposensitive to abscisic acid ( ABA ) in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening assays. We identified genes that are likely associated with the observed physiological and biochemical changes through a genome-wide transcriptome analysis of kai2 under both well-watered and dehydration conditions. These data provide evidence for crosstalk between ABA- and KAI2-dependent signaling pathways in regulating plant responses to drought. Our findings suggest that chemical or genetic manipulation of KAI2 signaling may provide novel ways to improve drought resistance.
Schistosoma japonicum, the causative agent of zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica in China and the Philippines, exploits host insulin for growth and development. To further investigate the importance of insulin signaling in schistosomes, we have focused on the insulin receptors ( SjIRs ) of S. japonicum. We have shown that human insulin can bind the L1 subdomains of recombinant SjIR1 and SjIR2, and that RNA interference ( RNAi ) knockdown of the SjIRs in adult S. japonicum in vitro results in reduced transcription of the SjIRs and other important downstream genes within the insulin pathway. These genes are associated with glucose metabolism and schistosome fecundity. In addition, we observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake in SjIR-knockdown worms compared with luciferase controls. In vaccine/challenge experiments, we found that recombinant SjLD1 and SjLD2 depressed female growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice presented with a low dose challenge infection. These data re-emphasize the potential of the SjIRs as veterinary transmission blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica.
Lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) is a leading cause of disability in the South Pacific, where >96% of the 1. 7 million population are at risk of LF infection. Current mass drug administration ( MDA ) efforts have effectively reduced LF prevalence, but the goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone in some regions. The primary vector of LF in the South Pacific is Aedes polynesiensis, which is difficult to control using existing methods. Here, we demonstrate that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an A. polynesiensis strain ( ‘CP’ strain ) that is stably infected with the endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedes riversi. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays demonstrate that CP males are equally competitive, resulting in population elimination when CP males are introduced into wild type A. polynesiensis populations. These findings support the feasibility of a vector elimination strategy as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts. The strategy involves inundative releases of bi-directionally incompatible males that induce sterility in A. polynesiensis females, resulting in vector population elimination.
Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as Rhodesiense sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne disease that is always fatal if left untreated. In Tanzania, HAT is highly focalized and of major socio-economic and public health importance in affected communities. This study aimed to estimate the public health burden of rhodesiense HAT in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and financial costs in a highly disease-endemic area of Tanzania. The study used hospital records from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment for HAT at Kaliua Health Centre, Urambo District. The direct medical and other indirect costs incurred by individual patients and by the health services were calculated, and DALYs were estimated using methods recommended by the Global Burden of Disease Project. The estimated DALYs for HAT in Urambo District were 215. 7 ( 95% CI: 155. 3–287. 5 ) and 281. 6 ( 95% CI: 209. 1–362. 6 ) without and with age-weighting, respectively. When 45% under-reporting was included, the results were 622. 5 ( 95% CI: 155. 3–1098. 9 ) and 978. 9 ( 95% CI: 201. 1–1870. 8 ), respectively. The costs of treating 143 patients were estimated at US$ 15, 514, of which patients themselves paid US$ 3, 673 and the health services US$ 11, 841. The burden in terms of indirect non-medical costs for the 143 patients was estimated at US$ 9, 781.
NGLY1 is a cytoplasmic de-N-glycosylating enzyme that is highly conserved among eukaryotes. Mice with a knockout of the Ngly1 gene ( Ngly1−/− ) are embryonic lethal in a C57BL/6 background. However, the lethality of Ngly1−/− mice is partially rescued by the additional deletion of the Engase gene, which encodes another cytoplasmic de-N-glycosylating enzyme that leaves a single GlcNAc at glycosylated Asn residues. The lethality of Ngly1−/− mice is also partially rescued by changing the genetic background from C57BL/6 to a C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background. Despite the rescue of lethality, Ngly1−/−;Engase−/− mice and Ngly1−/− mice in the C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background exhibit recognizable phenotypes that are reminiscent of the symptoms observed in human subjects with NGLY1-deficiency. These phenotypes are strongly suppressed by the additional deletion of Engase in both Ngly1−/−;Engase−/− mice and Ngly1−/− mice in the C57BL/6 and ICR mixed background. These observations suggest that Ngly1−/− mice and Ngly1−/−;Engase−/− mice could serve as valuable animal models for studying the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency.
In Drosophila segmentation, the hunchback ( hb ) gene is activated by the Bicoid ( Bcd ) protein gradient. However, gene regulation is subject to intrinsic noise, which must be constrained to produce reproducible and coordinated developmental events. We investigated how noise is controlled during hb gene expression by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output noise on hb promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics. We used a stochastic model of the hb promoter in which the number and strength of Bcd and Hb binding sites can be varied. The model was fit to data from wild-type embryos, the self-regulation mutant hb14F, and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the hb promoter. The results indicate that wild-type Hb output noise is predominantly dependent on the transcription and translation dynamics of its own expression, rather than on Bcd fluctuations. In contrast, the constructs and mutant lacking self-regulation indicate that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to the variation in Bcd binding site number across a number of fly species.
Introgression of Neanderthal alleles into modern human populations has resulted in a low level of Neanderthal ancestry scattered across the genomes of many modern-day humans. After hybridization, on average, selection appears to have removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. Here, we develop a novel method for estimating the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites using estimates of Neanderthal allele frequency along the genomes of modern-day humans. We confirm that East Asians had somewhat higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans even after accounting for selection. We find that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is best understood as acting on many weakly deleterious alleles. We propose that the majority of these alleles were effectively neutral—and segregating at high frequency—in Neanderthals, but became selected against after entering human populations of much larger effective size. This work suggests that differences in effective population size may play a far more important role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought.
The HIV-1 promoter within the viral long terminal repeat ( LTR ) plays a central role in the regulation of viral gene expression, replication, and the establishment of a latent state. After viral integration into the host genome, stochastic fluctuations in viral gene expression, amplified by the Tat positive feedback loop, can contribute to the formation of either a productive, transactivated state or an inactive state. In a significant fraction of cells harboring an integrated copy of the HIV-1 model provirus, this bimodal gene expression profile is dynamic, as cells spontaneously and continuously flip between active ( Bright ) and inactive ( Off ) expression modes. The HIV-1 promoter contains cis-acting Sp1 and NF-κB elements that regulate gene expression via the recruitment of both activating and repressing complexes. We show that interplay in the recruitment of such positive and negative factors modulates the stability of the Bright and Off modes and thereby alters the sensitivity of viral gene expression to stochastic fluctuations in the Tat feedback loop. Using model lentivirus variants with mutations introduced in the Sp1 and NF-κB elements, we reveal significant functional differences in contributions of each site to viral gene regulation. The Sp1 sites apparently stabilize both the Bright and the Off states, such that their mutation promotes noisy gene expression and reduction in the regulation of histone acetylation and deacetylation. The NF-κB sites exhibit distinct properties, with κB site I serving a stronger activating role than κB site II. Finally, analysis of 362 clonal cell populations infected with the viral variants revealed that mutations in any of the Sp1 sites yield a 6-fold higher frequency of clonal bifurcation compared to that of the wild-type promoter.
Orthologs are genes in different species that evolved from a common ancestral gene. Accurate identification of orthologs is a central problem in comparative genomics, and several orthology identification projects have been developed in recent years. However, only a few reports have compared the accuracy of these projects, and several recent efforts have not been systematically evaluated. We compared the results of nine leading orthology projects and methods ( COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA ) and two standard methods ( bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance ) with respect to both phylogeny and function. We found that OMA and Homologene perform best in phylogenetic analysis and functional analysis where high specificity is required. At lower functional specificity but higher coverage, OrthoMCL outperforms Ensembl Compara, and to a lesser extent Inparanoid. EggNOG provides the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories, but is not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. We also found that standard bidirectional best-hit often outperforms projects with more complex algorithms. Our study provides guidance for the broad community of orthology data users as to which database best suits their needs, introduces new methodology to verify orthology, and sets performance standards for current and future approaches.
Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection of the tropics and sub-tropics, is an important neglected tropical disease for which a single 40-year old drug, praziquantel, is the only available treatment. However, its use in mass drug administration is leading to signs of drug-resistance emerging. To address this challenge, we developed a computational drug repurposing pipeline supported by phenotypic screening to identify new schistosomicidal agents. This approach highlighted several protein kinases as interesting new biological targets for schistosomiasis, as they play an essential role in the parasite’s biological processes. We also elucidated the kinome of Schistosoma japonicum, as well as updated the kinomes of S. mansoni and S. haematobium. By comparing these kinomes with the human kinome, we identified potential targets of existing inhibitors that are unique to Schistosoma species, allowing us to identify novel targets and suggest approved drugs that might inhibit them. These include previously suggested schistosomicidal agents such as bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib, as well as new inhibitors such as vandetanib, saracatinib, tideglusib, alvocidib, dinaciclib, and 22 newly identified targets such as CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, and MEK1.
Transcription factors are central components of the intracellular regulatory networks that control gene expression. Here, we study the folding and binding of the pKID domain of the transcription factor CREB to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. Our simulations of a topology-based Gō-type model predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism, and the existence of partially bound intermediates. We find that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. This contrasts with models in which binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist in the unbound state at equilibrium. Interestingly, increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a “fly-casting”-like process. We also find that the inclusion of attractive non-native interactions results in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding, but do not significantly change the binding mechanism. Our study helps explain how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition.
Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem in Latin America and the Caribbean ( LAC ). In 2012, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution calling for increased investment in schistosomiasis control and support for countries to initiate elimination programs. This systematic review aimed to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in LAC countries and territories. A total of 132 articles published between 1942 and 2014 were included in the review, providing 1, 242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points. The majority of the studies were conducted in Brazil ( 69. 7% ), where several ‘hot spots’ with high prevalence were identified. Countries such as Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia need to update their epidemiological status of schistosomiasis to re-design their national programs and target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In contrast, countries such as Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted schistosomiasis transmission, but require follow-up surveys to verify this status.
Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 is characterized by a genetic bottleneck that selects a single viral variant, the transmitted/founder ( TF ), during most transmission events. To assess viral characteristics influencing HIV-1 transmission, we sequenced 167 near full-length viral genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones ( IMC ) including TF variants and multiple non-transmitted ( NT ) HIV-1 subtype C variants from six linked heterosexual transmission pairs near the time of transmission. We found that consensus-like genomes sensitive to donor antibodies were selected for during transmission in these six transmission pairs. However, TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or viral replicative capacity in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC ) and monocyte-derived dendritic cells ( MDDC ). In addition, resistance of the TF variant to the antiviral effects of interferon-α ( IFN-α ) was not significantly different from that of non-transmitted variants from the same transmission pair. Thus, neither in vitro viral replicative capacity nor IFN-α resistance discriminated the transmission potential of viruses in the quasispecies of these chronically infected individuals.
Lymphatic filariasis is a disease caused by filarial parasites that can lead to lymphedema and elephantiasis in humans. Even in the absence of an adaptive immune system, lymphatic dilatation and dysfunction can occur in filarial infections. However, severe irreversible lymphedema and elephantiasis appear to require an intact adaptive immune response. To understand how filarial parasites directly influence the lymphatic system, human lymphatic endothelial cells ( LEC ) were exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or serum from infected patients. We found that live filarial parasites or filarial antigens induced significant proliferation and differentiation of LEC into tube-like structures in vitro. Moreover, serum from patients with patent filarial infections and those with chronic lymphatic obstruction induced significantly increased LEC proliferation compared to serum from uninfected individuals. The differentiation of LEC into tube-like networks was associated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of their tissue inhibitors. We also found that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways, which in turn decreased trans-endothelial transport. These findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation and provide insight into the mechanisms underlying the pathology seen in lymphatic filariasis.
Single-cell genome amplification is a powerful tool for the study of microbial ecology and evolution, as the majority of microorganisms cannot be obtained in pure culture. Multiple Displacement Amplification ( MDA ) is a method that enables genome amplification from single cells isolated by FACS flow cytometry, serial dilution, or micromanipulation methods. In this study, we used a microfluidic device to isolate individual Escherichia coli cells and amplify genomic DNA by MDA in 60-nl reactions. Our results show that reducing the MDA reaction volume from microliters to nanoliters lowers nonspecific synthesis resulting from contaminant DNA templates and unfavourable interaction between primers. The quality of the genome amplification was assessed by qPCR and compared favourably to single-cell amplifications performed in standard 50-μl volumes. Amplification bias was greatly reduced in nanoliter volumes, thereby providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from both microliter and nanoliter volumes provided high-quality sequence data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, thereby demonstrating a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells.
Hantavirus host assemblages and human disease in the Atlantic Forest are influenced by landscape structure and local small mammal diversity. We analyzed 283 rodent capture records from the Atlantic Forest and found that hantavirus host proportions were more positively influenced by landscape diversity than by a particular habitat or agricultural matrix type. Local small mammal diversity also positively influenced known pathogenic hantavirus host proportions, indicating that a plasticity to habitat quality may be more important for these hosts than competition with native forest dwelling species. We found a consistent positive effect of sugarcane and tree plantation on the proportion of rodent hosts, whereas defaunation intensity did not correlate with the proportion of hosts of potentially pathogenic hantavirus genotypes in the community. The spatial match between host hotspots and human disease vulnerability was 17%, while coldspots matched 20%. Overall, we discovered strong spatial and land use change influences on hantavirus hosts at the landscape level across the Atlantic Forest. Our findings suggest that disease surveillance must be reinforced in the southern and southeastern regions of the biome where the highest predicted hantavirus host proportion and levels of vulnerability spatially match. Importantly, our analyses suggest there may be more complex rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease than currently hypothesized.
Infection with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus, requires the pro-survival BCL2 protein BCLXL for the survival of infected cells. BCL2 family proteins play a crucial role in maintaining cell homeostasis by controlling mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Upon infection with flaviviruses, the expression of MCL1, another pro-survival BCL2 protein, is suppressed, leading to the activation of BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis. However, the continued expression of BCLXL delays apoptosis in infected cells, allowing the virus to disseminate to neighbouring cells and leading to high pathogenicity. Treatment with BCLXL inhibitors, as well as deficiency of the BCLXL gene, induces BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis in flavivirus-infected cells. Furthermore, inhibition of BCLXL increases phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, thereby suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. In vivo, haploinsufficiency of the BCLXL gene, as well as administration of BH3 mimetic compounds, increases the survival rate after challenge with Japanese encephalitis virus infection and suppresses inflammation. These results suggest that BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, and that BCLXL may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress the propagation of flaviviruses.
Canine rabies is a significant public health problem in Viet Nam. The economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam over a ten year period ( 2005–2014 ) was estimated to be over $719 million USD. The largest portion of this burden ( 92% ) was comprised of costs associated with post-exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ), while dog vaccination efforts accounted for only 6% of the costs. Canine rabies resulted in between 36, 560 and 45, 700 disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ), measured in years of life lost ( YLL ), and a total of 914 human deaths were reported over the study period. The cost per dog vaccinated was estimated to be $1. 75 USD. Our results indicate that canine rabies impacts in Viet Nam are consistent with the burden elsewhere reported in Asia, with large expenditures on PEP and very small investments in dog vaccination.
The Type II Secretion System ( T2SS ) is a molecular machine that drives the secretion of fully-folded protein substrates across the bacterial outer membrane. A key element in the machinery is the secretin: an integral, multimeric outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. We show that three distinct forms of T2SSs can be distinguished based on the sequence characteristics of their secretin pores. Two of these forms, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, are further distinguished by the pilotin that mediates their transport and assembly into the outer membrane. We have determined the crystal structure of the novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholerae, which is functionally equivalent and yet structurally unrelated to the pilotins found in Klebsiella and other bacteria. AspS binds to a specific targeting sequence in the Vibrio-type secretins, enhances the kinetics of secretin assembly, and homologs of AspS are found in all species of Vibrio as well as those few strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. that can be transmitted to a susceptible host through skin abrasions or mucous membranes. The ability of leptospires to adhere to cell surface and extracellular matrix components is a crucial step for dissemination and colonization of host tissues. In this study, we investigated the functional roles of transmembrane outer membrane proteins OmpL36, OmpL37, and OmpL47, which we recently identified on the leptospiral surface. We determined the capacity of these proteins to bind to host tissue components by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found that OmpL37 binds elastin preferentially, exhibiting dose-dependent, saturating binding to human skin and aortic elastin. OmpL37 also binds fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. The binding to human skin elastin by both recombinant OmpL37 and live Leptospira interrogans is specifically enhanced by rabbit antiserum for OmpL37, suggesting the involvement of OmpL37 in leptospiral binding to elastin. We also demonstrate that OmpL37 is recognized by acute and convalescent leptospirosis patient sera and by Leptospira-infected hamster sera. Finally, we found that OmpL37 protein is detected in pathogenic Leptospira serovars and not in saprophytic Leptospira. Thus, OmpL37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptospira that may be promoting attachment of Leptospira to host tissues.
Broadly neutralizing antibodies 4E10 and 2F5, isolated from HIV-1 infected individuals, recognize epitopes in the membrane proximal external region ( MPER ) of gp41 that are transiently exposed during viral entry. These antibodies are polyreactive, binding to the viral membrane and their epitopes in the MPER. We present a model to calculate the probability that during the pre-hairpin intermediate, the transient period when the epitopes are first exposed, a bound antibody will disable a trivalent gp41 before fusion is complete. The model predicts that for these antibodies to be effective at neutralization, the time to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in this conformation, about five minutes or less for 4E10 and 2F5. We investigate the role of avidity in neutralization and show that 2F5 IgG, but not 4E10, is much more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment. We attribute this to 2F5 interacting more stably than 4E10 with the viral membrane. We use the model to elucidate the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and propose an extension of the model to analyze neutralization data. The extended model predicts the dependencies of neutralization on the rate constants that characterize antibody binding, the rate of fusion of gp41, and the number of gp41 bridging the virus and target cell at the start of the pre-hairpin intermediate.
Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus and transmitted by blackflies, is a major public health problem in Africa. A study was conducted in three hyperendemic foci in Mali and Senegal to assess whether annual or six-monthly treatment with ivermectin for 15 to 17 years could interrupt transmission and eliminate the parasite. The study evaluated infection and transmission levels up to 5 years after the last treatment. A total of 29, 753 people were examined and 492, 600 blackflies were analyzed for the presence of Onchocerca volvulus larvae. The results showed a declining trend in infection and transmission levels after the last treatment. In two sites, the prevalence of microfilariae and vector infectivity rate were zero 3 to 4 years after the last treatment. In the third site, where infection levels were high before stopping treatment, there was a consistent decline in infection and transmission to very low levels 3 to 5 years after stopping treatment. All infection and transmission indicators were below postulated thresholds for elimination. The study has established the proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in at least some endemic foci in Africa.
Human rhinovirus, a frequent cause of the common cold, is a non-enveloped virus of the picornavirus family, which also includes other significant pathogens such as poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. During cell entry, the small myristoylated capsid protein VP4 is released from the virus, interacts with the cell membrane and is implicated in the delivery of the viral RNA genome into the cytoplasm to initiate replication. In this study, we have produced recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged human rhinovirus VP4 and shown it can induce membrane permeability in liposome model membranes. Dextran size-exclusion studies, chemical crosslinking and electron microscopy demonstrated that VP4 forms a multimeric membrane pore, with a channel size consistent with transfer of the single-stranded RNA genome. The membrane permeability induced by recombinant VP4 was influenced by pH and was comparable to permeability induced by infectious virions. These findings present a molecular mechanism for the involvement of VP4 in cell entry and provide a model system which will facilitate exploration of VP4 as a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family.
Francisella tularensis ( Ft ) is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium and the causative agent of tularemia, a disease designated as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Francisella novicida ( Fn ), a pathogen of mice, has a similar lipid A structure to human clinical isolates of Ft. We identified three enzymes required for Fn lipid A carbohydrate modifications: flmF1 ( mannose ), flmF2 ( galactosamine ), and flmK ( galactosamine/mannose ). Mutants lacking either galactosamine ( flmF2 ) or galactosamine/mannose ( flmK ) addition to their lipid A were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. In addition, aerosolization of the mutants ( flmF2 and flmK ) provided protection against challenge with wild-type ( WT ) Fn, whereas subcutaneous administration of only the flmK mutant provided protection from challenge with WT Fn. Infection of an alveolar macrophage cell line by the flmK mutant induced higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) and macrophage inhibitory protein-2 ( MIP-2 ) compared to infection with WT Fn. Bone marrow–derived macrophages ( BMMø ) from Toll-like receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) and TLR2/4 knockout mice infected with the flmK mutant produced significantly higher amounts of interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and MIP-2 than BMMø infected with WT Fn. However, production of IL-6 and MIP-2 was undetectable in BMMø from MyD88−/− mice infected with either strain. We hypothesize that the ability of the flmK mutant to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and innate immune responses mediated by the MyD88 signaling pathway may be responsible for its attenuation, leading to the induction of protective immunity by this mutant.
E. coli, act as molecular switches to coordinate ribosome assembly. Here we show that Era is not essential in S. aureus but is important for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. Protein interaction studies reveal that Era interacts with the 16S rRNA endonuclease YbeY and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA. We determine that both Era and CshA are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. Era and CshA also form direct interactions with the ( p ) ppGpp synthetase RelSau, with RelSau positively impacting the GTPase activity of Era but negatively affecting the helicase activity of CshA. We propose that in its GTP-bound form, Era acts as a hub protein on the ribosome to direct enzymes involved in rRNA processing/degradation and ribosome subunit assembly to their site of action. This activity is impeded by multiple components of the stringent response, contributing to the slowed growth phenotype synonymous with this stress response pathway.
Anthrax lethal toxin ( LT ) is known to induce vascular insufficiency in experimental animals, but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we show that mice lacking neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) are strikingly more sensitive to LT than mice lacking the other two NOS enzymes, endothelial NOS ( eNOS ) or inducible NOS ( iNOS ). The increased sensitivity of nNOS−/− mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin or cytokine responses, and could be replicated in wild-type ( WT ) mice through pharmacological inhibition of nNOS with 7-nitroindazole. Histopathological analyses revealed that LT induced architectural changes in the hearts of nNOS−/− mice, with rapid appearance of novel inter-fiber spaces, but no associated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Electron microscopic analyses revealed pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS−/− and WT mice, including endothelial/capillary necrosis and degeneration, inter-myocyte edema, myofilament and mitochondrial degeneration, and altered sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae. Multiple biomarkers of cardiac injury were elevated in LT-treated mice, including myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein. Echocardiography indicated an average reduction in ejection fraction following LT treatment in both nNOS−/− and WT mice, indicative of decreased contractile function in the heart. We report the heart as an early target of LT in mice and discuss a protective role for nNOS against LT-mediated cardiac damage.
Parasitic nematodes cause some of the most common neglected tropical diseases and infect over 1 billion people worldwide. However, our understanding of their biology has been limited by the lack of tools for genetic intervention. Here, we report the development of a method for introducing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruptions in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. We disrupted the S. stercoralis twitchin gene unc-22, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. Ss-unc-22 mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair when a repair template was provided. Omission of a repair template resulted in deletions at the target locus. Ss-unc-22 mutations were heritable; we passed Ss-unc-22 mutants through a host and successfully recovered mutant progeny. Using a similar approach, we also disrupted the unc-22 gene of the rat-parasitic nematode Strongyloides ratti. Our results demonstrate the applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 to parasitic nematodes, and thereby enable future studies of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites.
Ribosome drop-off is a well established phenomenon that plays a crucial role in translational accuracy and nutrient starvation responses during protein translation. When cells are under stress conditions, such as amino acid starvation or high level recombinant protein expression, ribosome drop-off can substantially affect the efficiency of protein expression. Here, we introduce a mathematical model that describes the effects of ribosome drop-off on the ribosome density along the mRNA and on the concomitant protein synthesis rate. Our results show that ribosome premature termination may lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, such as a ribosome density that increases from the 5’ to the 3’ end. Importantly, the model predicts that the effects of ribosome drop-off on the translation rate are mRNA-specific, and we quantify their resilience to drop-off, showing that mRNAs which present ribosome queues are much less affected by ribosome drop-off than those which do not. Moreover, among those mRNAs that do not present ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with the elongation rate, so that sequences using fast codons are expected to be less affected by ribosome drop-off. This result is consistent with a genome-wide analysis of S. cerevisiae, which reveals that under favourable growth conditions mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off.
Soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections are a major public health problem in many developing countries. The World Health Organization recommends routine deworming of school and pre-school aged children to control morbidity. However, transmission continues to occur due to persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment. To accelerate the interruption of transmission, alternative strategies of mass drug administration ( MDA ) are being explored. The DeWorm3 trial is currently ongoing to test the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission using MDA. In this study, we investigate whether criteria to determine whether transmission interruption is unlikely can be defined at earlier timepoints. We employed a stochastic, individual-based simulation model to simulate core aspects of the DeWorm3 community-based cluster-randomized trial. We evaluated a range of threshold prevalences measured at six months after the last round of MDA and the impact of MDA coverage levels to see if the likelihood of bounce-back or elimination could reliably be assessed at that point. The analyses suggest that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage.
Serogroup specificity in Vibrio cholerae is determined by the O-specific polysaccharide ( OSP ) of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ). Here we report the evaluation of a conjugate vaccine for cholera ( OSP:TThc ) made from V. cholerae O1 Ogawa O-Specific Polysaccharide–core ( OSP ) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment ( TThc ). We immunized mice intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSP:TThc or OSP only, with or without dmLT, a non-toxigenic immunoadjuvant derived from heat labile toxin of Escherichia coli. We detected significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP following a single immunization in mice receiving OSP:TThc with or without adjuvant. Anti-LPS IgG responses were detected following a second immunization in these cohorts. No anti-OSP or anti-LPS IgG responses were detected at any time in animals receiving un-conjugated OSP with or without immunoadjuvant, and in animals receiving immunoadjuvant alone. Responses were highest following immunization with adjuvant. Serum anti-OSP IgM responses were detected in mice receiving OSP:TThc with or without immunoadjuvant, and in mice receiving unconjugated OSP. Serum anti-LPS IgM and vibriocidal responses were detected in all vaccine cohorts except in mice receiving immunoadjuvant alone. No significant IgA anti-OSP or anti-LPS responses developed in any group. Administration of OSP:TThc and adjuvant also induced memory B cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model.
Candida albicans inhibits the virulence of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa by suppressing the expression of pyochelin and pyoverdine genes, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. In a neutropenic mouse model of microbial gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination, we show that C. albicans secreted proteins directly suppress P. aeruginosa pyoverdine and pyochelin expression and inhibit P. aeruginosa virulence in mice. Interestingly, suppression or deletion of pyochelin and pyoverdine genes has no effect on P. aeruginosa’s ability to colonize the GI tract but does decrease P. aeruginosa’s cytotoxic effect on cultured colonocytes. Oral iron supplementation restores P. aeruginosa virulence in P. aeruginosa and C. albicans colonized mice. Our findings provide insight into how a bacterial-fungal interaction can modulate bacterial virulence in the intestine and validate the use of a mammalian model system to explore the complexities of polymicrobial, polykingdom infections in order to identify new therapeutic targets for preventing microbial disease.
The rate and timing of reversion to wild-type ( WT ) virus from escape mutant ( EM ) virus is highly variable following infection with HIV-1 or Simian Immunodeficiency Virus ( SIV ). EM virus evades CD8+ T cell recognition and is often less replicatively fit compared to WT virus. However, the rate and timing of reversion to WT virus determines the outcome of infection. Infection with mixes of EM and WT virus containing ≥10% WT virus results in rapid outgrowth of WT virus at SIV Gag CD8 T cell epitopes within 7 days of infection in pigtail macaques. In contrast, infection with biologically passaged SHIVmn229 viruses with much smaller proportions of WT sequence or a molecular clone of pure EM SIVmac239 results in a delayed or slow pattern of reversion. WT virus is not detectable until ≥8 days after inoculation and takes ≥8 weeks to become the dominant quasispecies. A delayed pattern of reversion is associated with significantly lower viral loads. The diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT virus, which in turn predicts the outcome of infection. The delay in reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 T cell escape mutations in some scenarios suggests opportunities to reduce the pathogenicity of HIV during very early infection.
Yeast strains collected from Evolution Canyon ( EC ), Israel, exhibit an extremely high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. We found that cadmium resistance is primarily caused by an enhanced function of a metal efflux pump, PCA1. Molecular analyses demonstrate that this enhancement can be largely attributed to mutations in the PCA1 promoter sequence, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments show that three single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter quantitatively increase its activity and thus enhance the cells' cadmium resistance. The critical nucleotides found in EC strains are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other yeast species, suggesting that they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides had diverged in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which gave cells growth advantages under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. Our results provide a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance.
Gastric cancer, the second leading cause of global cancer mortality, is a molecularly heterogeneous disease characterized by deregulation of multiple oncogenic pathways. We sought to identify major oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer with significant relationships to patient survival. Using gene expression signatures, we devised an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. We identified three oncogenic pathways ( proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin ) deregulated in the majority ( >70% ) of gastric cancers. We functionally validated these pathway predictions in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions may play an important role in influencing disease behavior. Individual gastric cancers can be successfully taxonomized by oncogenic pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway activity by expression signatures thus permits the study of multiple cancer-related pathways interacting simultaneously in primary cancers, at a scale not currently achievable by other platforms.
Superhelical Destabilization in Regulatory Regions of Stress Response Genes. We show that strongly destabilized sites in the E. coli K12 genome are statistically significantly overrepresented in the upstream regions of genes encoding transcriptional regulators. These genes include transcriptional activators, repressors, and two-component systems that play important regulatory functions in gene expression. In particular, the upstream regions of genes that directly respond to physiological and environmental stimuli are more destabilized than are those regions of genes that are not involved in these responses. Moreover, if a pathway is controlled by a transcriptional regulator whose gene has a destabilized 5′ flank, then the genes ( operons ) in that pathway also usually contain strongly destabilized SIDD sites in their 5′ flanks. We observe this statistically significant association of SIDD sites with upstream regions of genes functioning in transcription in 38 of 43 genomes of free-living bacteria, but in only four of 18 genomes of endosymbionts or obligate parasitic bacteria. These results suggest that strong SIDD sites 5′ to participating genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes, which are known to transiently alter superhelicity. We propose that these SIDD sites are active and necessary participants in superhelically mediated regulatory mechanisms governing changes in the global pattern of gene expression in prokaryotes in response to physiological or environmental changes.
Sexual reproduction in the fungus Podospora anserina is regulated by a network of high-mobility group ( HMG )-box transcription factors. We identified 12 HMG-box genes in P. anserina, of which 11 are involved in the sexual cycle. PaHMG5, an ortholog of SpSte11 from Schizosaccharomyces pombe, is a pivotal activator of mating-type genes in P. anserina. PaHMG9 is a repressor of several phenomena specific to the stationary phase, most notably hyphal anastomoses. PaHMG5 is at the hub of a network of several HMG-box factors that regulate mating-type genes and mating-type target genes. This network also controls fertility genes that are not regulated by mating-type transcription factors. PaHMG5 and SpSte11 are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating-type genes, although P. anserina and S. pombe diverged 550 million years ago. The P. anserina and S. pombe mating-type genes and their upstream regulatory factor form a module of HMG-box genes analogous to the SRY/SOX9 module, revealing a commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi.
During the 2013–2016 West African Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) epidemic, there was an urgent need to determine the persistence of Ebola virus ( EBOV ) in survivors’ body fluids and the potential risk of transmission. An observational cohort study was implemented in Sierra Leone to investigate the presence of EBOV in semen and other body fluids of EVD survivors. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase assessed the persistence of EBOV in semen of 100 adult men within five months of initial protocol discussions. The second phase assessed the persistence of virus in multiple body fluids ( semen, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, and tears ) of 120 men and 120 women. The study demonstrated the need to implement semen testing programs among EVD survivors and informed national and global guidelines in real time. Strong community engagement helped rapidly implement the study during the epidemic, and the lessons learned and study tools developed accelerated the implementation of such programs in EVD affected countries. The study also informed studies examining the persistence of Zika virus.
Chemotactic bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, are able to detect and migrate in chemical gradients of nutrients and toxins. To predict the chemical environments these bacteria typically encounter in their natural habitat, we reevaluate the phenomenological Weber's law and its generalizations to the Weber-Fechner law and fold-change detection. We use quantitative dose-response curves from in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) measurements of the chemotactic sensory pathway, information theory, as well as measurements and simulations of swimming bacteria. We show that maximizing mutual information implies maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient ( chemotactic index ), and hence the drift velocity of cells swimming up the gradient. Our results indicate that chemotactic E. coli typically encounters exponential gradients in its natural habitat, since its pathway has evolved to maintain perception in these. To fully characterize the chemical environment of chemotactic bacteria in terms of distributions, we expect a matching between the statistical properties of typical stimuli and the corresponding cellular responses assuming certain optimization criteria. Our model is able to connect a large number of phenomenological laws with information theory at the molecular level, and provides a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine.
Hematopoietic stem cells ( HSCs ) are responsible for the life-long supply of blood cells and are characterized by their multi-potency and self-renewal capacity. HSCs were thought to have indefinite lifespans due to their self-renewal capacity, but there is increasing evidence that genetically identical HSCs differ in lifespan and that the lifespan of a HSC is predetermined and HSC-intrinsic. We present a new model based on reliability theory to account for the diversity of lifespans of HSCs. Using clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling, we found that the best fit of the experimental data is provided by a model where the repopulation failure kinetics of each HSC are largely anti-persistent, or mean-reverting, processes. This means that failure rates repeatedly increase during population-wide division events and are counteracted and decreased by repair processes. In the long-run, a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior occurs due to a slow increase in the mean failure rate of self-renewal, leading to rapid clonal extinction. We show that the lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics, and that shorter and longer lived HSCs differ significantly in their pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations.
Antibodies play a crucial role in providing protective immunity against chronic helminth infections, which affect approximately one-third of the world's population. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these large multi-cellular parasites have remained obscure. We demonstrate that helminth-specific antibodies induce the rapid trapping of tissue migrating helminth larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following challenge infection with the natural murine parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri ( Hp ). Antibodies induce the expression of Arginase-1 in macrophages, which directly impairs larval motility. This novel mechanism of alternative macrophage activation is antibody-dependent and IL-4Rα-independent. In the presence of helminth antigens, antibodies elicit a novel subtype of IL-4Rα-independent alternatively activated macrophages, which we refer to as helminth-antibody activated macrophages ( HAAM ). We show that HAAM upregulate Arginase-1 and immobilize infective and tissue-dwelling larvae. In addition, we demonstrate that antibodies mediate the activation of macrophages resulting in Arginase-1 expression and immobilization of tissue invasive helminth larvae. Our data indicate that antibodies form a previously unrecognized component of macrophage regulation during type 2 immune responses and provide a novel effector function of antibodies in activating macrophages to modulate the expression of genes normally associated with the alternatively activated phenotype.
DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are a major threat to genome integrity and cell survival. The most accurate way to repair DSBs is through homologous recombination ( HR ) with an intact copy of the broken locus. However, the early steps of HR, such as resection from DSB ends that generates recombinogenic single strands, are difficult to visualize in living cells. We have developed a new, non-intrusive method that uses protein oligomerization rather than operator multiplicity to form visible foci. We applied this method to the HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III and monitored the dynamics of a chromatin locus next to a DSB in single living cells. We observed transient confinement of the damaged chromatin region during the very early steps of resection, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. In addition, we found that resection in a yku70 mutant began ∼10 min earlier than in wild type, defining this as the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. Our new DNA-labelling and -targeting method will be widely applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization, dynamics and function in normal and pathological contexts.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major public health problem in Latin America. People living in areas with active vector-borne transmission have multiple contacts with T. cruzi, and reinfections are possible. However, there is little quantitative knowledge about the frequency and timing of parasite re-inoculation in humans. We developed stochastic agent-based models to estimate the rate of re-inoculation in humans and assess the frequency of reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. We used a hybrid genetic algorithm to fit the models to epidemiological data from Argentinean rural villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of T. cruzi reach 56% in humans. The best model predicted 0. 032 ( 0. 008–0. 042 ) annual reinfections per individual with 98. 4% of them occurring in the chronic phase. The parasite escapes the adaptive immune response mounted after the primary infection in at least 20% of the events of re-inoculation. With these low annual rates, the risks of reinfection during the typically long chronic stage of the disease stand around 14% ( 4%–18% ) and 60% ( 21%–70% ) after 5 and 30 years, with most individuals being re-infected 1–3 times overall. These low rates are better explained by the weak efficiency of the stercorarian mode of transmission than a highly efficient adaptive immune response.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection can lead to a range of outcomes, from asymptomatic or subclinical infection to classical dengue fever ( DF ), dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ), or dengue shock syndrome ( DSS ). While the majority of DENV infections result in subclinical outcomes, epidemiologic studies suggest that type-cross-reactive immunity can influence disease outcome in subsequent infections. However, the mechanisms controlling these differential clinical outcomes remain poorly defined. In this study, blood samples were collected from a cohort of school-aged Thai children who subsequently experienced a subclinical DENV infection or developed dengue illness. PBMC collected prior to infection were stimulated in vitro with DENV and the secretion of 30 cytokines was measured using a multiplexed, bead-based array. Significant differences were found in cytokine production based on both the type of DENV used for stimulation and the occurrence of clinical illness. Higher levels of IL-15, MCP-1, and IL-6 were found in subjects who later developed symptomatic DENV infection, while lower levels of IL-12, IL-2R, MIP-1α, RANTES, GM-CSF, and TNFα were found in subjects with symptomatic infection. These data demonstrate significant differences in pre-existing immune responses to DENV associated with the clinical outcome of subsequent infection, supporting the existence of both protective and pathologic immune profiles.
In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, Hedgehog ( Hh ) forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior–posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. However, a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and Hh concentration thresholds has not been demonstrated. Here, we provide evidence that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and propose that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Using mathematical modeling, we predict that at steady state, only two domains can be defined in response to Hh, suggesting that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a static Hh gradient. Computer simulations suggest that a spatial “overshoot” of the Hh gradient occurs, i. e., a transient state in which the Hh profile is expanded compared to the Hh steady-state gradient. Through a temporal examination of Hh target gene expression, we observe that the patterns initially expand anteriorly and then refine, providing in vivo evidence for the overshoot. The Hh gene network architecture suggests this overshoot results from the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor, Patched ( Ptc ). In fact, when the network structure was altered such that the ptc gene is no longer up-regulated in response to Hh-signaling activation, we found that the patterns of gene expression, which have distinct borders in wild-type discs, now overlap. Our results support a model in which Hh gradient dynamics, resulting from Ptc up-regulation, play an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression.
Ethanol and inhaled anesthetics influence the nervous system, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we describe a new mouse mutation, Lightweight ( Lwt ), isolated in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea ( ENU ) forward mutagenesis screen for animals with enhanced locomotor activity. Lwt results from a nonsense mutation in the mouse homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) unc-79 gene. While Lwt/Lwt homozygotes are perinatal lethal, Lwt/+ heterozygotes are dramatically hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate a conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and extend this observation to the related unc-80 mutant and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants. Lwt/+ heterozygotes also exhibit an altered response to the anesthetic isoflurane, reminiscent of unc-79 invertebrate mutant phenotypes. In addition, Lwt/+ heterozygotes are mildly hyperactive when exposed to a novel environment and are smaller than wild-type animals. They also exhibit increased food consumption yet have a leaner body composition. Interestingly, Lwt/+ heterozygotes voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The acute hypersensitivity to and increased voluntary consumption of ethanol observed in Lwt/+ heterozygous mice in combination with the observed hypersensitivity to ethanol in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and nca-1;nca-2 double mutants suggests a novel conserved pathway that might influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans.
Plasmodium falciparum, the etiological agent of human malaria, has been identified as a target of the Anopheles gambiae immune response. The Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway, has been shown to have potent anti-P. falciparum activity. Silencing the expression of caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, or over-expressing rel2, an Imd pathway-controlled NFkappaB transcription factor, confers a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae mosquitoes that involves an array of immune effector genes. Using RNA interference, we have identified genes participating in the anti-Plasmodium signaling module regulated by Caspar, each of which represents a potential target to achieve over-activation of the pathway. The Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, yet also has reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. We further demonstrated that caspar silencing alone is sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response even in the relative absence of resident gut microbiota. Finally, we established the relevance of the Imd pathway components and regulated effectors TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense.
Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis that can lead to pulmonary fibrosis. In this study, we investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells ( BMMSCs ) in a mouse model of pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis. BMMSCs have been proposed as a promising therapy for fibrotic diseases. We found that BMMSCs did not have an anti-fibrotic effect in mice infected with P. brasiliensis. Instead, we observed an increase in granulomatous inflammatory areas, fibrocytes count, soluble collagen, and collagen-3α1, TGF-β3, MMP-8, and MMP-15 gene expression in the lungs of mice treated with BMMSCs. This suggests that BMMSCs may exacerbate pulmonary fibrosis in this model. Interestingly, when BMMSCs were combined with itraconazole ( ITC ), a drug used to treat fungal infections, we observed a decrease in TIMP-1 and MMP-13 gene expression. We also found that lung supernatants from infected and BMMSCs-treated mice induced a higher expression of collagen I in human fibroblasts. Our results suggest that BMMSCs may not be effective in treating pulmonary fibrosis caused by P. brasiliensis, and that their interaction with the fungus may promote collagen expression and tissue remodeling.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum, transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies in the Mediterranean subregion. Climate change has led to the geographical expansion of these sand fly vectors. To understand the seasonal dynamics of these vectors, a consortium of partners from eight Mediterranean countries carried out entomological investigations in sites where L. infantum transmission was recently reported. From 2011 to 2013, a total of 99, 000 sand fly specimens were collected and analyzed, resulting in the description of seasonal dynamics of 56, 000 sand flies belonging to six L. infantum vector species. The study found that the time of sand fly appearance/disappearance differed between sites, and seasonal densities showed variations in each site. Significant correlations were found between latitude/mean annual temperature of sites and the first month of sand fly appearance, which ranged from early April to the first half of June, and the type of density trend, varying from a single peak in July/August to multiple peaks increasing in magnitude from May through September. The period of potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion was associated with a regular bell-shaped density curve having a wide peak center encompassing the July-September period, and falling between early May to late October for more than 99% of values.
Scrub typhus is a public health problem in the Asia-Pacific region caused by the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. In addition to infecting endothelial cells, O. tsutsugamushi was found to replicate in monocytes isolated from healthy donors and alter the expression of more than 4, 500 genes, as demonstrated by microarray analysis. The expression of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes, and genes associated with the M1 polarization of macrophages was significantly upregulated. O. tsutsugamushi also induced the expression of apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. Live organisms were indispensable to the type I interferon response and apoptosis, and enhanced the expression of M1-associated cytokines. These data were related to the transcriptional changes detected in mononuclear cells isolated from patients with scrub typhus. The microarray analyses revealed the upregulation of 613 genes, including interferon-related genes, and some features of M1 polarization were observed in these patients, similar to what was observed in O. tsutsugamushi-stimulated monocytes in vitro. This is the first report demonstrating that monocytes are clearly polarized in vitro and ex vivo following exposure to O. tsutsugamushi.
Insects, such as ants, use visual memory to navigate through complex environments, but it is unknown how their small brains implement this capability. The mushroom body neuropils have been identified as a crucial memory circuit in the insect brain, but their function has mostly been explored for simple olfactory association tasks. We show that a spiking neural model of the mushroom body circuit, originally developed to describe fruitfly olfactory association, can also account for the ability of desert ants to rapidly learn visual routes through complex natural environments. We further demonstrate that abstracting the key computational principles of this circuit, including one-shot learning of sparse codes, enables the theoretical storage capacity of the ant mushroom body to be estimated at hundreds of independent images. We have shown that the neural architecture of the insect mushroom body can implement the ‘familiarity’ algorithm for ant route following. In our simulation, the mushroom body learns over 80 on-route images, reconstructed from real ant viewpoints in their natural habitat, and reliably distinguishes them from the highly similar images obtained when looking off-route. The network which was originally developed for modelling simple olfactory associative learning in flies required almost no modification other than increased size to perform the apparently much more complex function of supporting navigation under realistic conditions.
Plants have evolved unique defense mechanisms to protect themselves from disease. One such mechanism is pathogen-triggered leaf abscission, where infected leaves are shed to prevent the spread of disease. We developed a system to study pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis by infecting cauline leaves with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. We found that Pseudomonas syringae lacking a functional type III secretion system fail to elicit an abscission response, suggesting that the abscission response is a novel form of immunity triggered by bacterial effectors. We identified several genes required for pathogen-triggered leaf abscission, including HAESA/HAESA-like 2, INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED. We also found that salicylic acid is necessary for full pathogen-triggered leaf abscission to occur, as well as for drought-triggered leaf abscission. Plants with mutations in genes necessary for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling, such as phytoalexin deficient 4, enhanced disease susceptibility 1, and salicylic acid induction-deficient 2, fail to abscise cauline leaves normally. We propose a threshold model regulating cauline leaf defense where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when an infection is deemed out of control, cauline leaves are shed.
Retinal starburst amacrine cells ( SACs ) play a major role in the detection of image motion direction. To study the mechanisms underlying the computation of direction selectivity ( DS ) in SAC dendrites, we measured electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular wave visual stimuli via somatic whole-cell recordings and quantified them using Fourier analysis. We found that fundamental and, especially, harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli. This direction selectivity persists in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting that inhibitory network interactions are not essential. The presence of harmonics indicates nonlinearity, which is likely due to the activation of voltage-gated channels. We also found that the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to the soma, due in part to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamatergic synaptic input, and that high-voltage–activated Ca2+ channels are active at rest. Using compartmental modeling, we conclude that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, which provides the spatial asymmetry necessary for direction discrimination. Optical recordings of visual stimulus-evoked Ca2+ signals also showed that dendritic sectors can be activated independently and that the strongest [Ca2+] increases are in the distal portions of the dendrites, near the output synapses.
The number of pathogens required to infect a host, termed the infective dose, varies dramatically across pathogen species. It has been predicted that infective dose will depend upon the mode of action of the molecules that pathogens use to facilitate their infection. Specifically, pathogens that use locally acting molecules will require a lower infective dose than pathogens that use distantly acting molecules. Furthermore, it has also been predicted that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators may be more virulent because they have a large number of cells in the inoculum, which will cause more harm to host cells. Here, we formally test these predictions using data on 43 different human pathogens from a range of taxonomic groups with diverse life-histories. We found that pathogens using local action do have lower infective doses, but are not less virulent than those using distant action. Instead, we found that virulence was negatively correlated with infective dose, and higher in pathogens infecting wounded skin compared with those ingested or inhaled.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic helminth that causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting approximately 200 million people, primarily in underprivileged regions of the world. Schistosoma mansoni is the most experimentally tractable schistosome species due to its ease of propagation in the laboratory and the high quality of its genome assembly and annotation. In this study, we investigated the role of microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in the development of S. mansoni from juvenile to adult stages. We used a bioinformatics tool called Sylamer to analyse the 3’-untranslated regions ( 3’-UTRs ) of transcripts differentially expressed between the juvenile and adult stages. We found that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence is the only one significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. We also identified a novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, and proposed hairpin folds for both sma-miR-277 and sma-miR-4989 that are compatible with the miRNA pathway. Our results indicate that sma-miR-277/4989 may play a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during the development of juvenile worms and suggest an important role in the sexual development of female schistosomes.
SARS-related coronaviruses ( SARSr-CoV ) have been detected in multiple species of horseshoe bats in China since 2005. However, these bat SARSr-CoVs show genetic differences from SARS-CoV and are considered unlikely to represent the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Here, we report the findings of our 5-year surveillance of SARSr-CoVs in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunnan Province, China. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered SARSr-CoV strains, together with our previous findings, reveal that the SARSr-CoVs circulating in this single location are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3 and ORF8. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain ( NTD ) and receptor-binding domain ( RBD ) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were all discovered in this cave. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. We hypothesize that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV.
Human soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections are controlled by periodic mass treatment with benzimidazole and imidothiazole drugs. However, high levels of resistance to these drugs have developed in roundworms of livestock, necessitating the need to monitor drug efficacy in human STHs. The faecal egg count reduction test ( FECRT ), which measures faecal egg output pre- and post-drug treatment, is being examined by WHO as a means of detecting the emergence of resistance. We have investigated the potential impact of density dependent fecundity on FECRT data. Density dependent fecundity refers to the phenomenon where the number of eggs produced by female worms increases as their population density decreases. This phenomenon has been observed in canine hookworms and is likely to apply to human STHs as well. The relaxation of density dependent constraints on egg production may lead to an increase in egg output by female worms that survive drug treatment, resulting in an underestimation of drug efficacy in the FECRT. The degree of underestimation will depend on the ability of worms to increase their egg output, which in turn depends on the extent to which their egg output is constrained prior to drug treatment.
Epithelial heparan sulfate ( HS ) plays a critical role in lung development by regulating the Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) signaling pathway. We show that epithelial deletion of HS synthetase Ext1 results in expanded branching tips and reduced branching number in the lung, associated with several mesenchymal developmental defects. We further demonstrate an expanded Fgf10 expression and increased FGF signaling activity in Ext1 mutant lungs, suggesting a cell non-autonomous mechanism. Consistent with this, we observed reduced levels of SHH signaling, which is responsible for suppressing Fgf10 expression. Moreover, reactivating SHH signaling in mutant lungs rescued the tip dilation phenotype and attenuated FGF signaling. Importantly, the reduced SHH signaling activity did not appear to be caused by decreased Shh expression or protein stability; instead, biologically active form of SHH proteins were reduced in both the Ext1 mutant epithelium and surrounding wild type mesenchymal cells. Together, our study highlights the epithelial HS as a key player for dictating SHH signaling critical for lung morphogenesis.
Paired-end sequencing has emerged as a key technique for detecting genome rearrangements and structural variation on a genome-wide scale. This technique is particularly useful for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements, such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and can produce novel fusion genes. We address the question of how much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement breakpoints and to localize them precisely using both theoretical models and simulation. We derive a formula for the probability that a fusion gene exists in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end sequences from this genome. We use this formula to compute fusion gene probabilities in several breast cancer samples, and we find that we are able to accurately predict fusion genes in these samples with a relatively small number of fragments of large size. We further demonstrate how the ability to detect fusion genes depends on the distribution of gene lengths, and we evaluate how different parameters of a sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection, breakpoint localization, and fusion gene detection, even in the presence of errors that suggest false rearrangements. These results will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes that are enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies.
Chemotaxis, the ability of cells to sense the direction of chemical gradients and respond by polarizing and migrating toward attractants, involves the coordinated action of separable but interrelated processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. Here, we describe a mathematical model that recreates the behaviors of chemotactic cells by implementing these processes in terms of reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell cortex implemented in the level set framework. The central module is an excitable network that accounts for random migration, while the response to combinations of uniform stimuli and gradients is mediated by a local excitation, global inhibition module that biases the direction in which excitability is directed. A polarization module linked to the excitable network through the cytoskeleton allows unstimulated cells to move persistently and, for cells in gradients, to gradually acquire distinct sensitivity between front and back. By varying the strengths of various feedback loops in the model, we obtain cellular behaviors that mirror those of genetically altered cell lines.
Tudor containing protein 6 ( TDRD6 ) is a male germ line-specific protein that is essential for the structure of the chromatoid body ( ChB ), elongated spermatid development, and male fertility. In this study, we show that TDRD6 interacts with the protein arginine methyl transferase PRMT5 in meiotic prophase I spermatocytes, which supports splicing. TDRD6 also associates with the spliceosomal core protein SmB in the absence of RNA and in an arginine methylation dependent manner. In TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes, PRMT5 association with SmB and arginine dimethylation of SmB are much reduced. As a result, TDRD6 deficiency impairs the assembly of spliceosomes, which feature 3. 5-fold increased levels of U5 snRNPs. In the nucleus, these deficiencies in spliceosome maturation correlate with decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in nuclear snRNP maturation. Transcriptome analysis of TDRD6-deficient diplotene spermatocytes revealed high numbers of splicing defects such as aberrant usage of introns and exons as well as aberrant representation of splice junctions.
Bacterial populations that colonize a host can play important roles in host health, including serving as a reservoir that transmits to other hosts and from which invasive strains emerge. Understanding rates of acquisition and clearance of colonizing populations is therefore important. Previous studies of colonization dynamics have been based on assessment of whether serial samples represent a single population or distinct colonization events. However, these studies often rely on a fixed genetic distance threshold below which isolates are considered to represent the same strain. This approach is often inadequate to account for the diversity of the underlying within-host evolving population, the time intervals between consecutive measurements, and the uncertainty in the estimated acquisition and clearance rates. Here, we present a fully Bayesian model that provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing us to determine bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. Our method explicitly models the within-host variation using population genetic simulation, and the inference is done using a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ). We validate the method with multiple carefully conducted simulations and demonstrate its use in practice by analyzing a collection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) isolates from a large recently completed longitudinal clinical study.
The shoot apical meristem ( SAM ) is responsible for initiating leaves, flowers, and lateral meristems in a highly ordered pattern via phyllotaxis. The active transport of the plant hormone auxin plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that cellular hormone transporters of the PIN family create local auxin maxima at precise positions, which in turn lead to organ initiation. However, different concepts have been proposed to explain how auxin transporters create hormone fluxes to distinct regions within the plant. The canalization hypothesis proposes that auxin transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, which could be initiated by local diffusion. In contrast, a second hypothesis proposes that auxin is systematically transported towards areas with the highest concentrations. We show that a flux-based polarization hypothesis is able to explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem, thus providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in the plant. Auxin is actively transported throughout the plant from cell to cell by carriers located at the cell plasma membranes. PIN proteins facilitate auxin efflux, while AUX/LAX family proteins facilitate auxin import. We propose that both regimes correspond to different states of the same flux sensing mechanism, and that the flux-based hypothesis remains a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport throughout the plant.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites transmitted by sandflies. Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is the most severe form of the disease and requires improved point-of-care diagnostic tests for early case detection and surveillance. Previous studies have shown that IgG1 is a potential biomarker for monitoring clinical status in rapid diagnostic tests ( RDTs ). However, using a crude lysate antigen ( CLA ) as a capturing antigen in RDTs may not lead to robust results. Here, we employed in silico searches to reduce the number of wet lab experiments, focusing on promising candidates containing selected protein features. Immunoblots revealed L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients, which were then identified by mass spectrometry ( MS ). We searched for evidence of constitutive protein expression and presence of antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. Multiple high-scoring predicted epitopes from the shortlisted proteins were screened in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and nonendemic healthy control ( NEHC ) patient sera. Over 90% of the proteins identified from the immunoblots did not satisfy the selection criteria and were excluded from the downstream epitope mapping. Screening of predicted epitope peptides from the shortlisted proteins identified the most reactive, for which the sensitivity for IgG1 was 84% ( 95% CI 60–97% ) with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes. None of the sera from NEHCs were positive.
Cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) is a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected sandfly. In this study, a multiregional cohort of 317 patients with CL from six countries ( Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran ) was reviewed to document the incidence of caseating granulomas, a type of granuloma often associated with mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis ( TB ). The study found that caseating granulomas were present in 195 ( 61. 5% ) cases of CL and were divided into three types: caseating ( 25. 2% ), suppurative ( 4. 6% ), and tuberculoid without necrosis ( 70. 2% ). Caseating and tuberculoid granuloma groups were significantly different in terms of geographical source, with more cases harboring caseating granulomas in Saudi Arabia ( p<0. 0001 ). Histologically, both groups were different in the distribution of their Ridley's pattern ( p<0. 0001 ) with a doubling Ridley's pattern 3 in caseating granulomas ( 31% vs. 15% ) as opposed to doubling of Ridley's pattern 5 in tuberculoid granuloma group ( 38% vs. 19% ). The time needed to achieve healing ( Ridley's pattern 5 ) was notably shorter in tuberculoid vs. caseating group ( 4. 0 vs. 6. 2 months ). The study also found that 18. 2% of all CL cases harbored caseating granulomas, suggesting that CL should be considered part of the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions.
Type 2 diabetes in mice is associated with obesity and results from a combination of adipogenic and diabetogenic alleles. Here, we report the identification of a candidate gene for the diabetogenic effect of a QTL ( Nidd/SJL, Nidd1 ) contributed by the SJL, NON, and NZB strains in outcross populations with New Zealand Obese ( NZO ) mice. A critical interval of distal chromosome 4 ( 2. 1 Mbp ) conferring the diabetic phenotype was identified by interval-specific congenic introgression of SJL into diabetes-resistant C57BL/6J, and subsequent reporter cross with NZO. Analysis of the 10 genes in the critical interval by sequencing, qRT–PCR, and RACE–PCR revealed a striking allelic variance of Zfp69 encoding zinc finger domain transcription factor 69. In NZO and C57BL/6J, a retrotransposon ( IAPLTR1a ) in intron 3 disrupted the gene by formation of a truncated mRNA that lacked the coding sequence for the KRAB ( Krüppel-associated box ) and Znf-C2H2 domains of Zfp69, whereas the diabetogenic SJL, NON, and NZB alleles generated a normal mRNA. When combined with the B6. V-Lepob background, the diabetogenic Zfp69SJL allele produced hyperglycaemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma and liver triglycerides. We conclude that Zfp69 is the most likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of Nidd/SJL, and that retrotransposon IAPLTR1a contributes substantially to the genetic heterogeneity of mouse strains.
Alternative cell differentiation pathways are believed to arise from the concerted action of signalling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks. However, the prediction of mammalian cell differentiation from the knowledge of the presence of specific signals and transcriptional factors is currently a daunting challenge. In this respect, the vertebrate hematopoietic system, with its many branching differentiation pathways and cell types, is a compelling case study. We propose an integrated, comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling Th cell differentiation. As most available data are qualitative, we rely on a logical formalism to perform extensive dynamical analyses. To cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network, we use an original model reduction approach together with a stable state identification algorithm. We have identified stable states corresponding to canonical Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg subtypes, as well as transient hybrid cell types that co-express combinations of Th1, Th2, Treg and Th17 markers in an environment-dependent fashion. Our logical analysis highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical Th subtypes. Finally, our logical model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico.
Genome-wide patterns of transcription factor binding during early Drosophila development have been studied using a thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding. The model was used to evaluate the contribution of different biophysical forces to the binding of five regulators of early embryonic anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila melanogaster. Predictions based on DNA sequence and in vitro protein-DNA affinities alone achieved a correlation of ∼0. 4 with experimental measurements of in vivo binding. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among the five factors, and accounting for spatial patterning by modeling binding in every nucleus independently, had little effect on prediction accuracy. However, incorporating experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into the model dramatically improved predictions to a correlation of 0. 6–0. 9 for various factors across known target genes. Our results show that, in regions of open chromatin, binding can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors, with a minimal role for protein interactions. We suggest that a combination of experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models of transcription factor binding may be used to predict the binding landscape of any animal transcription factor with significant precision.
Daughterless ( Da ) and Extramacrochaetae ( Emc ), members of the basic helix-loop helix ( bHLH ) transcription factor family, control cell proliferation in Drosophila imaginal discs by regulating the activity of the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. Through a genetic analysis, we show that Emc controls the G2/M transition, and hence cell proliferation, by downregulating Da, which in turn transcriptionally represses string. The ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced levels of Emc or high levels of Da is sufficient to rescue the proliferative defects seen in these mutant cells. Moreover, we present evidence demonstrating that Da acts as a transcriptional repressor of string. These findings define a mechanism through which Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating the activity of Da. In Drosophila, Da and Emc are the only representatives of classes I and V bHLH factors, respectively, thereby facilitating functional studies. The interaction between these proteins and with other bHLH proteins is a determinant of cell fate decisions in different developmental contexts. Our data indicate that at least in Drosophila, E proteins can also control the G2/M transition in conjunction with Id factors, and thus we have described the first mechanism through which interacting class I and class V bHLHs intercede in this cell cycle transition.
Yeast filamentous growth is a complex biological process regulated by multiple signaling networks. However, few of these networks have been completely delineated. Here, we propose a comprehensive quantitative analysis pipeline for phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments to identify key proteins in specific pathways, discover protein-protein interactions, and infer signaling networks. The pipeline includes phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery. We applied this pipeline to yeast phosphoproteome data generated using SILAC ( Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture ) technique with interventional experiments ( kinase-dead mutations ). We identified 5 high-confidence proteins from meta-analysis and 19 hub proteins from correlation analysis, all of which are involved in stress responses. Nine of these proteins have direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. We tested four of our predicted proteins by interventional phenotypic experiments and all of them presented differential invasive growth, providing prospective validation of our approach. Our pipeline presents a systematic way for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation.
The regulation of the Drosophila X chromosome in the male germline has been the subject of much debate. Here we report three new findings concerning gene expression from the X in Drosophila testes. First, we show that X chromosome-wide dosage compensation appears to be absent from most of the Drosophila male germline. Second, microarray analysis provides no evidence for X chromosome-specific inactivation during meiosis. Third, we confirm the previous discovery that the expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis-specific promoters is strongly reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus the autosomes, but we show that this chromosomal difference in expression is established in premeiotic cells and persists in meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting that a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from the X during spermatogenesis in Drosophila. These findings help to resolve several previously conflicting reports and have implications for patterns of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila.
The pathogenesis of Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse model for the human diarrheal infection caused by enteropathogenic E. coli ( EPEC ) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli ( EHEC ), depends on the formation of epithelium-adherent microcolonies, also known as “attachment/effacement” ( A/E ) lesions. These microcolonies must be dynamic and able to self-renew by continuous re-infection of the rapidly regenerating epithelium. We show here that all colonic epithelial A/E microcolonies are clonal bacterial populations, and thus depend on local clonal growth to persist. In wild-type mice, microcolonies are established exclusively within the first 18 hours of infection. These early events shape the ongoing intestinal geography and severity of infection despite the continuous presence of phenotypically virulent luminal bacteria. Mechanistically, induced resistance to A/E lesion de-novo formation is mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling and is induced specifically by virulent C. rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner. Our data demonstrate that the establishment phase of C. rodentium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a very short window of opportunity that determines both disease geography and severity. We show that the development of colonic C. rodentium A/E pathogenesis is critically dependent on very early bacteria-host interactions. The characteristic A/E lesions that determine the severity of infection originate from a limiting number of single-bacterial epithelial infection events that need to occur within the first 18 hours of infection.
Measuring the overlap between two populations, such as species, taxonomical units, or gene variants, is in principle straightforward when both populations are fully sampled. However, in practice, only a fraction of each population’s objects are likely to be sampled due to stochastic data collection or sequencing techniques. Existing methods for quantifying population overlap under subsampled conditions are biased and their uncertainty cannot be quantified. Here, we derive and validate a method to rigorously estimate the population overlap from incomplete samples when the total number of objects in each population is known. This method, based on Bayesian inference, takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. It also provides a natural framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates, and can be used prospectively in study planning by quantifying the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty. This method is particularly relevant in the ecology and genomic epidemiology of malaria.
Eukaryotic protein kinases play a central role in regulating most cellular functions by phosphorylating targeted protein substrates through a highly conserved catalytic core. In the active state, the catalytic core oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. However, the intramolecular interactions that regulate the active state mechanics are not well understood. Using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a representative model, we define a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that regulate the active state mechanics. These interactions include a salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. We show that the highly conserved β3-lysine is not required for phosphoryl transfer but is essential for the active state mechanics. The β3-lysine is a structural ATP sensor that facilitates the active state mechanics by coordinating the transition of the β-sheet region of the N-lobe and linking this region with the αC-helix. The active state mechanics can be regulated through the R-spine and Shell in the absence of the salt bridge and the electrostatic interaction between the activation loop and the αC-helix.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration ( MDA ) for lymphatic filariasis ( LF ) from 2000 to 2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. In 2016, we compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-MDA surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6–7 years and a community-based survey of people aged ≥8 years. We conducted a systematic school-based Transmission Assessment Survey ( TAS ) in all elementary schools ( N = 29 ) and a cluster survey in 28 villages on the two main islands of American Samoa. We collected information on demographics and risk factors for infection using electronic questionnaires, and recorded geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were collected to test for circulating filarial antigen ( CFA ) using the Alere Filariasis Test Strip. The school-based TAS identified nine antigen-positive children and found an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 0. 7% ( 95% CI: 0. 3–1. 8 ). The community-based survey identified 102 antigen-positive people and estimated an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6. 2% ( 95% CI: 4. 5–8. 6 ). CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school-based TAS had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive predictive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community-based survey identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission in American Samoa 10 years after the last round of MDA.
Female sex determination in zebrafish is a complex process influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. In this study, we investigated the role of two oocyte-expressed signaling molecules, Gdf9 and Bmp15, in female sex determination and maintenance of the female sexual phenotype in zebrafish. We generated targeted mutations in the genes for Gdf9 and Bmp15 and found that females deficient in Bmp15 begin development normally but switch sex during the mid- to late-juvenile stage and become fertile males. In contrast, females deficient in Gdf9 did not exhibit a sex reversal phenotype. Our results provide the first mechanistic insights into how oocytes regulate the maintenance of sex in zebrafish. We propose that the outcome of the oocyte-somatic gonad interaction is the stabilization of cyp19a1a expression and thus estrogen production by the somatic gonad. Consistent with this, we have shown that the somatic gonad expresses probable receptors for Bmp15. We have also shown that estrogen production is necessary for female development and that the function of Bmp15 in female sex maintenance is likely linked to the regulation of estrogen biosynthesis via promoting the development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle. Our results establish the framework of a genetic pathway required for female sexual development and maintenance in zebrafish that is likely conserved in other fish species.
Hox proteins play a fundamental role in controlling morphogenetic diversity in animals by regulating distinct sets of target genes along the anterior–posterior body axis. To achieve high-regulatory specificity, it has been postulated that Hox proteins co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their target genes in a highly context-specific manner in vivo. Here, we analyze the regulation of the cell death gene reaper ( rpr ) by the Hox protein Deformed ( Dfd ) and suggest that local activation of rpr expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of Dfd with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. We have shown that eight transcriptional regulators, Apt, Gcm, Ems, En, Slp1, Brk, Doc1 and Disco, are required in addition to the Hox protein Dfd to properly regulate the expression of the apoptosis gene reaper in a specific subset of cells of the maxillary segment. Our findings suggest that proper spatio-temporal Hox target gene regulation is achieved by the combined action of multiple transcriptional regulators: the Hox proteins themselves and a large number of structurally diverse transcription factors.
Plants recognize and respond to pathogen attack by detecting pathogen-specific molecules at the cell surface and inside the cell. Pathogen effectors are monitored by intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat ( NB-LRR ) sensor proteins in plants and mammals. Here, we study the genetic requirements for defense responses of an autoactive mutant of ADR1-L2, an Arabidopsis coiled-coil ( CC ) -NB-LRR protein. ADR1-L2 functions upstream of salicylic acid ( SA ) accumulation in several defense contexts, and it can act as a “helper” to transduce specific microbial activation signals from “sensor” NB-LRRs. We generated an autoactive missense mutation, ADR1-L2D484V, in a small homology motif termed MHD. Expression of ADR1-L2D484V leads to dwarfed plants that exhibit increased disease resistance and constitutively high SA levels. We used ADR1-L2D484V to define genetic requirements for signaling. Signaling from ADR1-L2D484V does not require NADPH oxidase and is negatively regulated by EDS1 and AtMC1. Transcriptional regulation of ADR1-L2D484V is correlated with its phenotypic outputs; these outputs are both SA–dependent and –independent. The genetic requirements for ADR1-L2D484V activity resemble those that regulate an SA–gradient-dependent signal amplification of defense and cell death signaling initially observed in the absence of LSD1. Importantly, ADR1-L2D484V autoactivation signaling is controlled by both EDS1 and SA in separable, but linked pathways.
MORC6 is a protein that mediates transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis through heterochromatin condensation. Previous studies have shown that MORC6 physically interacts with SUVH9, a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation ( RdDM ) pathway. However, how MORC6 mediates transcriptional silencing remains to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate that SUVH2 and SUVH9 can either act in the same pathway as MORC6 or act synergistically with MORC6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. Moreover, we show that IDN2, a double-stranded RNA-binding protein, interacts with MORC6 and mediates the silencing of a subset of MORC6 target loci. We also demonstrate that other RdDM components, including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2, are required for transcriptional silencing at a subset of MORC6 target loci. Furthermore, we show that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex components SWI3B, SWI3C, and SWI3D interact with MORC6 and mediate transcriptional silencing. These results suggest that the RdDM components are involved not only in DNA methylation but also in MORC6-mediated heterochromatin condensation.
Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) is a molecular chaperone that plays a critical role in the development of vertebrates. In this study, we used zebrafish as a vertebrate model to investigate the role of Hsp90 in phenotype modification. We found that mild perturbation of Hsp90 function at critical developmental stages may underpin the variable penetrance and expressivity of many developmental anomalies. We defined Hsp90 inhibitor levels that did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type zebrafish strains. Using these conditions, we found that Hsp90 inhibition increased the severity of the recessive eye phenotype in sunrise, caused by a pax6b mutation, and decreased the severity of the recessive eye phenotype in dreumes, caused by a sufu mutation. In another strain, we uncovered a previously unobserved spectrum of severe structural eye malformations, reminiscent of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia complex in humans. Inbreeding of offspring from selected unaffected carrier parents led to significantly elevated malformation frequencies and revealed the oligogenic nature of this phenotype. We also found that Hsp90 inhibition can decrease developmental stability in zebrafish, as indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalmia and sunrise phenotypes.
N-terminal acetylation is a common protein modification found throughout the tree of life, where the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain becomes co-translationally acetylated after the removal of the initiating methionine residue. In this study, we analyzed the amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and detected more than 1, 200 mature protein N-termini. We found that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans and that the sequence requirements that promote N-terminal acetylation are similar to those in other eukaryotes. We identified the ( X ) PX rule as the sole true determinant for N-terminal acetylation, which indicates the prevention of acetylation under all circumstances. This rule can be used to genetically engineer a protein to study the biological relevance of the presence or absence of an acetyl group, thereby generating a generic assay to probe the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation. We applied this assay by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and in flies and propose that the ( X ) PX rule can be used to study the function of N-terminal acetylation in all species.
The ability of RNA polymerase III ( RNAP III ) to efficiently recycle from termination to reinitiation is critical for the production of abundant tRNA during cellular proliferation, development, and cancer. However, the unique termination mechanisms used by RNAP III and their link to high transcription output are incompletely understood. We used two tRNA-mediated suppression systems to screen for RNAP III mutants with gain- and loss-of-termination phenotypes in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We identified 122 point mutations that cluster in the active center bridge helix and trigger loop, as well as the pore and funnel of the RNAP III elongation complex. These mutants exhibit increased elongation rate and increased transcription levels in vivo. Our data strongly support a kinetic coupling model in which elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency. We show that the mobile elements of the RNAP III active center, including the C11 subunit, are key determinants of termination and that some of the mutations activate RNAP III for overall transcription.
We have developed a method to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm. Our approach is based on the idea that the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes can be used to predict the binding specificity of SH2 domains. We have shown that our method performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices at predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. We have used our method to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure filtered on secondary structure and phosphorylation state. We have validated our predictions using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions. We have also used FoldX to predict in vivo protein-protein interactions for nine SH2 domain-containing proteins and annotated the predicted interactions with supporting information. Our results show that FoldX performs as well as experimentally derived consensus sequences or position-specific substitution matrices in the prediction of in vitro SH2-phosphopeptide binding and in vivo SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions. We propose that the FoldX algorithm is a useful alternative to peptide library experiments for the prediction of SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions.
Human cyclophilin 40 ( CyP40 ) is a cis/trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase ( PPIase ) that has been shown to dissolve tau amyloids in vitro and in a mouse model of tau accumulation. Tau is a microtubule associating protein that accumulates into toxic oligomers and amyloid deposits in tauopathies, the most common of which is Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ). CyP40 was found to interact with tau at sites rich in proline residues and was able to disaggregate other aggregating proteins that contain prolines. Moreover, CyP40 lacking PPIase activity was unable to disaggregate amyloids in vitro, indicating that its disaggregation activity is dependent on its PPIase activity. In a mouse model of tau accumulation, transduction of CyP40 reduced tau oligomers and tangles, improved neuronal health, and preserved cognitive function. These data implicate CyP40 as a potential therapeutic intervention for tauopathies and other amyloidogenic disorders. Furthermore, we describe a unique structural property of CyP40 that may enable it to disaggregate amyloids in an energy-independent manner.
Heterocyst pattern formation in cyanobacteria filaments is one of the simplest examples of cellular differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms. However, there is still a theoretical gap connecting the macroscopic and microscopic processes underlying heterocyst pattern formation. Here, we present an integrative approach for modeling and simulation of heterocyst pattern formation in cyanobacteria filaments under the paradigm of systems biology. We formulate the essential dynamical ingredients of the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacterium into a set of differential equations describing the time evolution of the concentrations of the relevant molecular products. We study the behavior of a single cyanobacterium under different external conditions, emulating nitrogen deprivation, and simulate the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments by coupling their respective genetic circuits via molecular diffusion. Our results show that by including both diffusion and noisy external conditions in the computational model, it is possible to reproduce the main features of the formation and sustainment of heterocyst patterns in cyanobacteria filaments as observed experimentally. Our model connects the diffusion of combined nitrogen along the filament with the dynamical properties of the underlying genetic circuit of each single cyanobacterium, capturing both the development of heterocyst patterns and their maintenance.
Onchocerciasis prevalence remains above the non-transmission threshold in Cameroon, despite more than 15 years of mass treatment with the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin ( CDTI ) program. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three Cameroonian health districts to explore the association between people’s beliefs/perceptions of onchocerciasis and the CDTI program, and their adherence to ivermectin. The study found that adherence to ivermectin was comparable between Bafang and Bafia ( 55. 0% and 48. 8%, respectively ), but lower in Yabassi ( 40. 7% ). Perceptions of the CDTI program were the most determinant factor in adherence to ivermectin. People who had a “not positive” opinion of ivermectin distribution campaigns were less compliant than those who had a positive opinion ( 40% vs 55% in Bafang, and 48% vs 62% in Bafia, p<0. 01 ), as well as those who had a negative appreciation of community drug distributors’ commitment ( 22% vs 53% in Bafang, 33% vs 59% in Bafia, 27% vs 47% in Yabassi; p<0. 01 ). The most common misconception about onchocerciasis transmission was the lack of hygiene, especially in Bafia and Yabassi. In Bafang, high proportions of people believed that onchocerciasis was due to high consumption of sugar ( 31% vs less than 5% in Bafia and Yabassi, p<0. 001 ).
The relative contribution of DNA methylation and genetic variants on protein biomarkers for human diseases has been investigated in this study. We combined DNA methylation and SNP data with measurements of protein biomarkers for cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. We identified 124 and 45 loci with effect sizes up to 0. 22 standard units’ change per 1% change in DNA methylation levels and up to four standard units’ change per copy of the effective allele in the epigenome-wide association study ( EWAS ) and genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) respectively. Most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory, whereas most EWAS loci were located in trans. Eleven EWAS loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including one in NLRC5 associated with CXCL11, CXCL9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels. We found that all EWAS signals that overlapped with a GWAS locus were driven by underlying genetic variants, and three EWAS signals were confounded by smoking. While some cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers appeared to have an effect also on DNA methylation levels, cis-regulatory SNPs for DNA methylation were not observed to affect biomarker levels. We present associations between protein biomarker and DNA methylation levels at numerous loci in the genome. The associations are likely to reflect the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or represent secondary effects to the pathogenesis of disease.
Varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) potently impairs the ability of human natural killer ( NK ) cells to respond to target cell stimulation in vitro, leading to a loss of both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. NK cells are important anti-viral immune effectors in VZV infection, yet it is unknown how VZV can directly affect NK cell function. We demonstrate that VZV can productively infect NK cells, and that VZV infected NK cells are affected, as well as VZV antigen negative NK cells that were exposed to virus in culture. The impairment of NK cell function is dependent on direct contact between NK cells and VZV infected inoculum cells. Profiling of the NK cell surface receptor phenotype revealed that functional receptor expression is predominantly stable, and inhibited NK cells were still capable of releasing cytotoxic granules when the stimulation signal bypassed receptor/ligand interactions and early signalling. In addition to inhibiting degranulation, IFN-γ and TNF production were also repressed by VZV co-culture, which was most strongly regulated in VZV infected NK cells. Interestingly, the closely related virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 ( HSV-1 ), was also capable of efficiently infecting NK cells in a cell-associated manner, and demonstrated a similar capacity to render NK cells unresponsive to target cell stimulation, however HSV-1 differentially targeted cytokine production compared to VZV.
Apparent motion ( AM ) is a phenomenon in which two stimuli alternately presented at different locations can evoke a percept of a stimulus continuously moving between the two locations. The neural mechanism underlying AM is thought to be increased activation of primary visual cortex ( V1 ) neurons tuned to locations along the AM path. However, evidence remains inconclusive. AM masking, which refers to the reduced detectability of stimuli along the AM path, has been taken as evidence for AM-related V1 activation. However, AM masking can also be explained by predictive coding models, which predict that responses to stimuli presented on the AM path are suppressed when they match the spatio-temporal prediction of a stimulus moving along the path. We find that AM has a distinct effect on the detection of target gratings, limiting the maximum performance at high contrast levels. This masking is strongest when the target orientation is identical to the orientation of the inducers. We developed a V1-like population code model of early visual processing and find that AM-related activation in early visual cortex is too small to either cause masking or to be perceived as motion. Our model instead predicts strong suppression of early sensory responses during AM, consistent with the theoretical framework of predictive coding.
Human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1 associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM). The HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in the transformation of CD4+ T cells by promoting cell proliferation and survival, mainly through the permanent activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of NF-κB target genes. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of Tax-induced NF-κB activation is still not fully understood. In this study, we elucidated the biochemical mechanism of Tax-induced NF-κB activation by reconstituting Tax-stimulated NF-κB activation in a cell-free system. We found that Tax functions as a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, which catalyzes the assembly of free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains. These free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains are then responsible for direct activation of the IKK complex by binding to the NEMO subunit of IKK. Our studies revealed the biochemical function of Tax in the process of IKK activation, which utilizes the minimal cellular ubiquitination components for NF-κB activation. This study clarifies the confusion on HTLV-1-induced IKK-NF-κB activation, reveals the essential cellular factors hijacked by HTLV-1, and might shed light on potential development of therapeutics for ATL and TSP/HAM.
The relationship between the number of individuals introduced to found a population ( propagule pressure ) and the establishment success of alien species has been evaluated for a broad range of taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants and long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. Using Bayesian meta-analytical methods, we found a positive mean effect of propagule pressure on establishment success to be a feature of every hypothesis we tested. However, establishment success most critically depended on propagule pressures in the range of 10–100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated primarily with different analytical approaches, with some evidence of larger effect sizes in animal rather than plant introductions. Conversely, no variation was accounted for in any analysis by the scale of study ( field to global ) or methodology ( observational, experimental, or proxy ) used. Our analyses reveal remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship between propagule pressure and alien population establishment success.
Interleukin 17A ( IL-17 ) is a cytokine that plays a role in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases by enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Here, we show that IL-17 attenuates the degradation of mRNAs encoding these mediators by changing the cooperation between AU-binding proteins ( AUBps ) and microRNA16 ( miR16 ). AUBps target AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of mRNAs and can either facilitate mRNA decay or stabilization. In the presence of miR16, AUBps and the target mRNA assemble in a novel ribonucleoprotein complex that leads to mRNA degradation. However, IL-17 attenuates miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBps over destabilizing AUBps, resulting in reduced mRNA degradation. These findings indicate that miR16 directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBps for target mRNAs independently of a seed sequence. Since AUBps affect the expression of about 8% of the human transcriptome and miR16 is ubiquitously expressed, IL-17 may affect many other cellular processes in addition to inflammation.
Sleeping sickness, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense ( T. b. rhodesiense ), is a zoonotic disease that affects both humans and animals. In Uganda, the disease has been spreading rapidly from its traditional focus in southeast Uganda to new districts. Cattle act as long-term reservoirs of human infective T. b. rhodesiense, showing few signs of morbidity, yet posing a significant risk to human health. In this study, we examined the relationship between human T. b. rhodesiense infection and human infective and non-human T. brucei s. l. circulating in cattle at village level in Kaberamaido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda. We compared T. brucei s. l. prevalence and presence or absence of T. b. rhodesiense in cattle between villages that had reported a case of sleeping sickness ( defined as case villages ) and those that had never reported a case ( defined as non-case villages ). We found that the sleeping sickness status of a village had a significant effect on the likelihood of T. brucei s. l. infection in cattle, with higher odds of infection in case villages than in non-case villages. We also found that village human sleeping sickness status had a significant effect on the detection of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle herd, with significantly higher likelihood of T. b. rhodesiense in the village cattle of case villages.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the NSL complex, which contains the histone H4 lysine 16-specific ( H4K16 ) acetyltransferase MOF, plays a major role in the regulation of housekeeping genes. Here, we report a comprehensive ChIP–seq analysis of four NSL complex members ( NSL1, NSL3, MBD-R2, and MCRS2 ) throughout the Drosophila genome. We find that the majority ( 85. 5% ) of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across different cell types. These genes are characterized by an increased abundance of the histone modifications H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac in gene promoter regions, as well as a well-defined nucleosome free region and broad transcription initiation patterns. Furthermore, we show that both NSL1 and NSL3 are required for efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ) to NSL target gene promoters, and that genes that undergo the most dramatic loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdowns tend to be enriched in DNA Replication–related Element ( DRE ). Our findings suggest that the NSL complex acts as a major regulator of housekeeping genes in flies by modulating initiation of Pol II transcription.
Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX4, a retrogene encoding a germline transcription factor. We have generated transgenic mice carrying D4Z4 arrays from an FSHD1 allele and from a control allele. These mice recapitulate important epigenetic and DUX4 expression attributes seen in patients and controls, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, ( incomplete ) epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and FSHD–specific variegated DUX4 expression in sporadic muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. Our data suggest that somatic epigenetic silencing of DUX4 is an evolutionary conserved mechanism and that contracted D4Z4 repeat arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle nuclei. ChIP and DNA methylation analyses indicate a relative chromatin relaxation of the D4Z4 repeats in D4Z4-2. 5 mice compared to D4Z4-12. 5 mice, concordant with the observed DUX4 expression pattern. These transgenic mice therefore represent a valuable animal model for FSHD and will be a useful resource to study the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD and to test new therapeutic intervention strategies.
Malaria vaccine candidate Apical Membrane Antigen-1 ( AMA1 ) induces protection, but only against parasite strains that are closely related to the vaccine. To overcome the AMA1 diversity problem, we need to understand the structural basis of cross-strain invasion inhibition. A vaccine containing four diverse AMA1 allelic proteins ( AMA1 Quadvax or QV ) elicited polyclonal rabbit antibodies that inhibited the invasion of four vaccine and 22 non-vaccine strains of Plasmodium falciparum. We compared polyclonal anti-QV with antibodies against a strain-specific, monovalent, 3D7 AMA1 vaccine and found that QV induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies. These antibodies were associated with increased conserved face and domain-3 responses and reduced domain-2 response. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies ( mAb ) raised against QV reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1. This epitope mapped to the conserved face of AMA1 and encompassed the 1e-loop. MAbs binding to the 1e-loop region were ∼10-fold more potent than previously characterized AMA1-inhibitory mAbs and inhibited AMA1 binding to its ligand RON2. Another novel mAb, 1E10, which bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked the proteolytic processing of AMA1. These novel inhibition susceptible regions and epitopes can form the basis for improving the antigenic breadth and inhibitory response of AMA1 vaccines. Vaccination with a few diverse antigenic proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes.
Mitotic spindle displacement to one side of a cell is important for many cells to divide unequally, but little is known about how spindle displacement is precisely timed. Here we show that a conserved mitotic progression mechanism, involving the anaphase-promoting complex ( APC ), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its degradation target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase ( CDK ), comprises a previously unrecognized timer for spindle displacement. In the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time, soon after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. We found that reducing the function of the proteasome, the APC, or Cdc20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement. Conversely, inactivating CDK in prometaphase caused the spindle to displace early. The consequence of experimentally unlinking spindle displacement from this timing mechanism was the premature displacement of incompletely assembled components of the mitotic spindle. We conclude that in this system, asymmetric positioning of the mitotic spindle is normally delayed for a short time until the APC inactivates CDK, and that this delay ensures that the spindle does not begin to move until it is fully assembled. This link between the cell cycle and asymmetric cell division might be evolutionarily conserved, because the mitotic spindle is displaced at a similar stage of mitosis during asymmetric cell divisions in diverse systems.
High-altitude hypoxia exerts severe physiological stress on the human body. Populations living in high-altitude regions, such as the Andean Altiplano and the Tibetan Plateau, have developed unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations to life at high altitude. However, the underlying genetic basis of these adaptations remains unknown. We performed a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to hypoxia in Andeans and Tibetans. We looked across each chromosome to identify genomic regions with previously unknown function with respect to altitude phenotypes. We also examined groups of genes functioning in oxygen metabolism and sensing to test the hypothesis that particular pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. Applying four population genetic statistics commonly used for detecting signatures of natural selection, we identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in these two populations separately. Our results indicate that several key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in Andeans and Tibetans, and several different chromosomal regions are implicated in the putative response to selection. Interestingly, one gene previously known to be important in cellular oxygen sensing, EGLN1 ( also known as PHD2 ), shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans, but the pattern of variation for this gene differs between the two populations.
Double-strand DNA breaks ( DSBs ) are a major source of genetic instability that can result from environmental assaults or the collapse of DNA replication. The efficient and precise repair of DSBs is essential for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to genetic instability. Here, we report that inverted DNA repeats ( IRs ) placed near a DSB can channel its repair from an accurate pathway that leads to gene conversion to a break-induced replication ( BIR ) pathway that leads to genetic instability. IRs can form unusual DNA structures when present in single-strand DNA ( ssDNA ) that is formed by DSB resection. We demonstrate that IRs can form two types of unusual DNA structures, and the choice between these structures depends on the length of the spacer separating IRs. IRs separated by a long ( 1-kb ) spacer are predominantly involved in inter-molecular single-strand annealing ( SSA ) leading to the formation of inverted dimers; IRs separated by a short ( 12-bp ) spacer participate in intra-molecular SSA, leading to the formation of fold-back ( FB ) structures. Both of these structures interfere with an accurate DSB repair by gene conversion and channel DSB repair into BIR, which promotes genomic destabilization. We also report that different protein complexes participate in the processing of FBs containing short ( 12-bp ) versus long ( 1-kb ) ssDNA loops. Overall, our studies uncover the mechanisms of genomic destabilization resulting from re-routing DSB repair into unusual pathways by IRs.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that causes both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts. Chronic P. aeruginosa infections are thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms, which are highly structured, multicellular communities encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. To study P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo, we developed an animal model using Drosophila melanogaster as the host. At 24 h post oral infection of Drosophila, P. aeruginosa biofilms localized to and were visualized in dissected Drosophila crops. These biofilms had a characteristic aggregate structure and an extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. P. aeruginosa cells recovered from in vivo grown biofilms had increased antibiotic resistance relative to planktonically grown cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on expression of the pel exopolysaccharide genes, as a pelB::lux mutant failed to form biofilms. The pelB::lux mutant was significantly more virulent than PAO1, while a hyperbiofilm strain ( PAZHI3 ) demonstrated significantly less virulence than PAO1. Biofilm formation by strains PAO1 and PAZHI3 in the crop was associated with induction of diptericin, cecropin A1 and drosomycin antimicrobial peptide gene expression 24 h postinfection. In contrast, infection with the non-biofilm forming strain pelB::lux resulted in decreased AMP gene expression in the fly.
Vasopressin receptor 1a ( Avpr1a ) is a gene responsible for mediating differences in vasopressin-mediated social behaviors between and within species. However, the genomic mechanisms that contribute to these differences are not well understood. Previous studies have suggested that both the proximal 5′ flanking region and a polymorphic microsatellite element within that region of the vole Avpr1a gene are associated with variation in V1a receptor ( V1aR ) distribution and behavior. Using homologous recombination in mice, we reveal that the proximal 5′ flanking sequences contribute modestly to species differences in V1aR distribution, and that variation in V1aR distribution impacts stress-coping in the forced swim test. We also demonstrate that the vole Avpr1a microsatellite structure contributes to Avpr1a expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring a subset of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central V1aR patterns in voles. This is the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles, providing a mechanism for generating behavioral diversity both at the individual and species level.
Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase ( AID ) induces double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) at immunoglobulin switch ( S ) regions and the c-MYC oncogene in yeast THO mutants, which are impaired in messenger RNA ( mRNP ) biogenesis. Such DSBs lead to chromosomal translocations via Non-Homologous End Joining ( NHEJ ). AID-mediated deamination of cytosines at S sequences in yeast is channeled by the Ung1 activity into DSBs as occurs in mammalian B cells, which are then repaired by NHEJ. The c-MYC oncogene, which shares features of S sequences, also acts as a hotspot of recombination in yeast THO mutants. Our study provides new clues to understand the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability. We show that yeast cells, as mammalian B cells, have the factors and pathways required to channel AID-mediated DNA lesions into DSBs responsible for NHEJ-dependent genome rearrangements and Class Switch Recombination ( CSR ).
In Escherichia coli, coordination between cell division and chromosome replication is essential for the production of viable progeny. However, cells lacking proper positioning of their cell division planes can still successfully propagate. Here, we characterize how these cells partition their chromosomes into daughters during asymmetric divisions. Using quantitative time-lapse imaging, we show that DNA translocase, FtsK, can pump as much as 80% of the chromosome ( 3. 7 Mb ) between daughters at an average rate of 1700±800 bp/s. Pauses in DNA translocation are rare, and in no occasions did we observe reversals at experimental time scales of a few minutes. The majority of DNA movement occurs at the latest stages of cell division when the cell division protein ZipA has already dissociated from the septum, and the septum has closed to a narrow channel with a diameter much smaller than the resolution limit of the microscope ( ~250 nm ). Our data suggest that the narrow constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by FtsK.
Epitope-based vaccines ( EVs ) have a wide range of applications, including therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for infectious diseases and cancer. The development of an EV is based on the knowledge of target-specific antigens from which immunogenic peptides, so-called epitopes, are derived. However, due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns, the number of epitopes that can be included in an EV is limited. Furthermore, the major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) binding these epitopes is highly polymorphic, making the optimal selection of these epitopes an important and interesting optimization problem. In this work, we present a mathematical framework based on integer linear programming ( ILP ) that allows the formulation of various flavors of the vaccine design problem and the efficient identification of optimal sets of epitopes. The framework selects the set with the maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. Our ILP approach allows an elegant and flexible formulation of numerous variants of the EV design problem, including common immunological requirements such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen, coverage of all MHC alleles in a set, or avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates.
HIV-1 transmission to the cervico-vaginal mucosa is the most common route of HIV-1 infection in women. Semen is not only a carrier of HIV-1 but also contains biological factors, including cytokines, that may affect HIV-1 transmission. Interleukin-7 ( IL-7 ) is one of the most prominent cytokines in semen of healthy individuals and is further increased in semen of HIV-1-infected men. Here, we investigated the role of IL-7 in HIV-1 vaginal transmission in an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue. We simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue in combination with IL-7 at concentrations comparable with those measured in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. We found that IL-7 significantly enhanced HIV-1 replication in ex vivo infected cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues showed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion by preventing apoptosis and increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells. Our results suggest that high levels of seminal IL-7 in vivo may be relevant to the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection.
Zika virus ( ZIKV ) infection of Aedes aegypti mosquito cells induces the production of both virus-specific small interfering RNAs ( siRNAs ) and PIWI-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ). The siRNAs are 21 nucleotides in length and are loaded into the exogenous siRNA pathway effector protein Argonaute 2 ( Ago2 ). However, silencing of Ago2 does not enhance ZIKV replication, suggesting that the exo-siRNA pathway is not the primary antiviral response mechanism. In contrast, enhanced ZIKV replication is observed in a Dicer 2 ( Dcr2 )-knockout cell line, indicating that the exo-siRNA pathway is involved in the antiviral response. Although ZIKV-specific piRNA-sized small RNAs are detected, they lack the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature motif and are bound to Ago3 but not Piwi5 or Piwi6. Silencing of Ago3, Piwi5, or Piwi6 does not enhance ZIKV replication. However, silencing of Piwi4 results in enhanced ZIKV replication, suggesting that Piwi4 has antiviral activity. We also report that the expression of ZIKV capsid ( C ) protein amplifies the replication of a reporter alphavirus, but unlike yellow fever virus C protein, it does not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway.
Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by species of the genus Sporothrix. In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a cross-sectional study was conducted to determine the association between Sporothrix species and clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis. A total of 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis were included in the study, and their Sporothrix isolates were analyzed by phenotypic and genotypic methods. The results showed that Sporothrix brasiliensis was associated with disseminated cutaneous infection without underlying disease, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection, whereas patients infected with Sporothrix schenckii sensu stricto presented with less severe and more localized disease. Interestingly, patients infected with S. brasiliensis required shorter durations of itraconazole treatment compared to those infected with S. schenckii. These findings suggest that Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis and that S. brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole. This study is the first to demonstrate an association between genotypic identification of Sporothrix species and several clinical aspects of human sporotrichosis, and it supports the careful speciation of Sporothrix isolates to guide clinical care.
Most “dark matter” transcripts in the mammalian genome are associated with known genes. This conclusion is based on a comprehensive analysis of RNA sequencing ( RNA-Seq ) and tiling array data from human and mouse tissues. While previous studies have suggested that a large portion of the genome is transcribed, our results indicate that the majority of these transcripts are either fragments of pre-mRNAs, alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons. Indeed, we identified 4, 544 new exons affecting 3, 554 genes. Most of the remaining intergenic transcripts are present at low levels and display characteristics of random sampling from a low-level background. We also found that tiling arrays are ill-suited to accurately detect transcripts expressed at low levels. In contrast to previous reports, we found relatively few transcripts in intergenic regions, with only 16, 268 seqfrags expressed above background levels in human and 11, 533 in mouse. A genome-wide analysis of “de novo” splice junctions revealed 2, 789 previously uncharacterized transcript fragments that have no overlap with exons of known gene annotations, 1, 259 of which map to intergenic regions. Overall, our results suggest that while there are bona fide new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance is generally low in comparison to known exons, and the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.
Protein thermostability is crucial for the development of novel protein bioreagents. In this work, a combined computational and experimental method was developed to increase the thermostability of the flavin mononucleotide based fluorescent protein Bacillus Subtilis YtvA LOV domain. The method includes five steps: single mutant computer screening to identify thermostable mutant candidates, experimental evaluation to confirm the positive selections, computational redesign around the thermostable mutation regions, experimental reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination. The method is simple and effective, and can be applied to other important proteins where other methods have difficulties. The thermostability of the YtvA LOV domain was increased by 31°C, thus extending its applicability in thermophilic systems. The success rate of the computational screening was 62%, highlighting the effectiveness of the method. The thermostable sites were mainly located at the dimeric interface, suggesting that forging stronger interactions between subunits is an effective way to increase thermostability.
Leishmaniasis, a protozoan disease transmitted by sand flies of the genus Lutzomyia, is endemic in the Panama Canal watershed and poses a health threat to residents, tourists, and the international research community. Here, we report the results of a study on the diversity of Lutzomyia sand fly species and their infection rates by Leishmania and Wolbachia in the tropical forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panama. We used DNA sequences to determine the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of the Phlebotominae occurring in the understory of the island. We detected Leishmania DNA in 43. 3% of Lu. trapidoi, 26. 3% of Lu. gomezi individuals, and in 0% of the other 18 sand fly species. The Leishmania infecting Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi was identified as Leishmania ( viannia ) naiffi, a species previously unknown in Panama but recognized as a type of cutaneous leishmaniasis vectored broadly across northern and central South America. We also detected distinct strains of Wolbachia in three of 20 sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, in which it frequently co-occurred with Leishmania. Our results suggest that Lu. trapidoi and Lu. gomezi are likely vectors of leishmaniasis to humans or other mammal species, and that Le. naiffi has recently expanded its range to include the Isthmus of Panama.
The reactivation of human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) from latency in dendritic cells ( DCs ) is dependent on the mitogen and stress activated kinase ( MSK ) family and the transcription factor CREB ( cAMP response element binding protein ). CREB binding to the viral major immediate early promoter ( MIEP ) is necessary for the recruitment of MSK kinase activity to initiate chromatin remodelling at the MIEP required for reactivation. MSK mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required to promote histone de-methylation and the subsequent exit of HCMV from latency. The interaction between CREB and MSKs is important for promoting chromatin modifications conducive for viral gene expression as well as acting as a classical transcription factor. Inhibition of this interaction between CREB and MSKs could provide a strategy for therapeutic intervention against HCMV reactivation. Using an adenovirus vector approach, we have shown that IE gene expression from latency in DCs is acutely sensitive to MSK chemical inhibition and that reactivation of HCMV involves the phosphorylation of histones bound to the latent MIEP. Furthermore, MSK mediated phosphorylation of these histones is highly dependent on concomitant CREB binding to the MIEP.
Ribosome biogenesis factor Nol11 is required for optimal rDNA transcription and craniofacial development in Xenopus. Nol11 is strongly expressed in the developing cranial neural crest ( CNC ) of both amphibians and mammals. Knockdown of Xenopus nol11 results in impaired pre-rRNA transcription and processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal development of the craniofacial cartilages. Inhibition of p53 rescues this skeletal phenotype, but not the underlying ribosome biogenesis defect, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved control mechanism through which ribosome-impaired craniofacial cells are removed. Excessive activation of this mechanism impairs craniofacial development. Our findings reveal a novel requirement for Nol11 in craniofacial development and provide further insight into the evolutionarily conserved relationship between specific ribosome biogenesis factors and the control mechanisms that regulate CNC survival and development.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni. The lack of an adequate laboratory test for leptospirosis is a major barrier for diagnosis, especially during the early stages of illness when antibiotic therapy is most effective. In order to identify new targets that could be used as diagnostic markers for leptospirosis, we constructed a protein microarray chip comprising 61% of the Leptospira interrogans proteome and investigated the IgG response from 274 individuals, including 80 acute-phase, 80 convalescent-phase patients and 114 healthy control subjects from regions with endemic, high endemic, and no endemic transmission of leptospirosis. We found 16 antigens that can discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from a region with high endemic transmission of leptospirosis, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Some of the antigens identified in this study, such as LipL32, the non-identical domains of the Lig proteins, GroEL, and Loa22, are already known to be recognized by sera from human patients. We also identified several novel antigens, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215, which showed good sensitivity and specificity rates for both acute- and convalescent-phase patients. Our study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptospiral infection.
Melanization, a potent immune effector mechanism of arthropods, plays an important role in mosquito defense against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. In this study, we used the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae as a model to investigate the role of melanization in mosquito defense against B. bassiana using in vivo functional genetic analysis and confocal microscopy. We found that melanin eventually formed on all stages of B. bassiana, including conidia, germ tubes and hyphae, except the single cell hyphal bodies. However, melanin rarely aborted the growth of any of these stages and the mycelium continued growing despite being melanized. Silencing TEP1 and CLIPA8, key positive regulators of Plasmodium and bacterial melanization in A. gambiae, abolished completely melanin formation on hyphae but not on germinating conidia or germ tubes. Our results suggest that melanization of early fungal stages is cell-mediated while that of late stages is a humoral response dependent on TEP1 and CLIPA8. Finally, we found that fungal proliferation was more rapid in TEP1 and CLIPA8 knockdown mosquitoes which exhibited increased sensitivity to natural B. bassiana infections.
Dengue virus host factors ( DENV HFs ) that are essential for the completion of the infection cycle in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti and vertebrate host represent potent targets for transmission blocking. Here, we investigated whether known mammalian DENV HF inhibitors could influence virus infection in A. aegypti. We evaluated the potency of bafilomycin ( BAF; inhibitor of vacuolar H+-ATPase ), mycophenolic acid ( MPA; inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase ), castanospermine ( CAS; inhibitor of glucosidase ), and deoxynojirimycin ( DNJ; inhibitor of glucosidase ) in blocking DENV infection of the mosquito midgut. We found that injection of BAF ( 5 µM ) and MPA ( 25 µM ) prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited DENV titers in the midgut at 7 days post-infection by 56% and 60%, and in the salivary gland at 14 days post-infection by 90% and 83%, respectively. Ingestion of BAF and MPA through a sugar meal or together with an infectious blood meal also resulted in various degrees of virus inhibition. RNAi-mediated silencing of several vATPase subunit genes and the IMPDH gene resulted in a reduced DENV infection, thereby indicating that BAF- and MPA-mediated virus inhibition in adult mosquitoes most likely occurred through the inhibition of these DENV HFs.
Seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization are pathological states of the brain characterized by excessive neuronal depolarization. These states are associated with major rearrangements of ions across the cell membrane and neuronal microenvironment. In this study, we investigated the role of cell volume in the dynamics of these pathological states. By incorporating cell swelling, dynamic ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics, we demonstrated the spontaneous transition between seizure and spreading depression states as the cell swells and contracts in response to changes in osmotic pressure. Our results revealed a dynamical definition for the physiological ceiling that separates seizure from spreading depression, as well as a second ceiling that demarcates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. Our model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial K buffering against seizures and spreading depression, and provides novel insights into anoxic depolarization and the relevant cell swelling during ischemia. We argue that the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the repertoire of the neuron membrane that can be understood only when the dynamic ion concentrations, oxygen homeostasis, and cell swelling in response to osmotic pressure are taken into consideration.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the causative agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, the most prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. In this study, we investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in host defense against P. brasiliensis infection. We found that murine bone marrow-derived dendritic cells responded to P. brasiliensis yeast cells infection by releasing the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β in a spleen tyrosine kinase ( Syk ), caspase-1 and NLR family member NLRP3 dependent manner. In addition, P. brasiliensis-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation was dependent on potassium ( K+ ) efflux, reactive oxygen species production, phagolysosomal acidification and cathepsin B release. Using mice lacking the IL-1 receptor, we demonstrated that IL-1β signaling has an important role in killing P. brasiliensis by murine macrophages. Our results demonstrate that the NLRP3 inflammasome senses and responds to P. brasiliensis yeast cells infection and plays an important role in host defense against this fungus.
Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-tropic parasite capable of infecting most nucleated cells in the central nervous system ( CNS ), including neurons and astrocytes. However, in vivo, Toxoplasma is primarily found in neurons. In vitro studies have shown that interferon-γ-stimulated astrocytes, but not neurons, are able to clear intracellular parasites, suggesting that neurons are persistently infected in vivo because they lack the ability to clear intracellular parasites. To test this theory, we used a novel Toxoplasma-mouse model capable of marking and tracking host cells that directly interact with parasites, even if the interaction is transient. We found that Toxoplasma shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection. This predilection remains in the setting of IFN-γ depletion; infection with parasites resistant to the major mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites; or when directly injecting parasites into the brain. These findings suggest that neurons are not incidentally infected, but rather they are Toxoplasma’s primary in vivo target.
Actin-myosin contractility plays a crucial role in the motility of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility. A minimal free-boundary model of actin-myosin contractility has been systematically explored to understand the mechanical states of the simplest motile cell. The model accounts for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous-like adhesion. The contraction generates a spatially graded centripetal actin flow, which in turn reinforces the contraction via myosin redistribution and causes retraction of the lamellipodial boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters the retraction, and the balance of protrusion and retraction shapes the lamellipodium. The model analysis shows that initiation of motility critically depends on three dimensionless parameter combinations, which represent myosin-dependent contractility, a characteristic viscosity-adhesion length, and a rate of actin protrusion. When the contractility is sufficiently strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along either straight or circular trajectories, and the motile behavior is sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary.
Understanding protein-protein interaction ( PPI ) networks is a major challenge in the post-genomic era. High-throughput methods such as yeast-2-hybrid ( Y2H ), tandem affinity purification ( TAP ), and mass spectrometric protein complex identification ( HMS-PCI ) have generated large amounts of PPI data. However, these data have high levels of noise and incompleteness. For example, Y2H screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and a false negative rate of 43%–71%, while TAP experiments have comparable levels of noise. We present a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks and predict new interactions. Our approach is based on geometric graphs, the best fitting network model for PPI networks, and achieves specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. We apply our technique to the human PPI network and predict 251 interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common GO terms. We validate a statistically significant portion of our predicted interactions in the HPRD database and the newer release of BioGRID.
Myotonic dystrophy type 1 ( DM1 ) is a human neurodegenerative disease caused by non-coding CTG repeat expansions in the DMPK gene. In addition to the sense expanded-repeat transcript, anti-sense expanded-repeat transcripts may also contribute to disease pathogenesis. We established a Drosophila model for DM1 to investigate the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG repeat transcripts. We found that co-expression of CTG and CAG expanded repeats resulted in dramatically enhanced toxicity in flies. This toxicity was accompanied by the generation of dcr-2 and ago2-dependent 21-nt triplet repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted the expression of CAG-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein ( TBP ), which bear long CAG repeats in both fly and man. These findings indicate that the generation of triplet repeat-derived siRNAs may dramatically enhance toxicity in human repeat expansion diseases in which anti-sense transcription occurs.
Pectobacterium wasabiae SCC3193 is a model soft rot phytopathogen that was originally isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the early 1980s and was previously classified as Pectobacterium carotovorum. However, our study reveals that SCC3193 can now be more accurately classified as Pectobacterium wasabiae based on genomic and proteomic comparisons with other sequenced soft rot bacteria. Our phylogenetic analysis indicates that P. wasabiae has been present in potato fields worldwide, including Europe and possibly North America, for a long time. We identified novel virulence determinants of P. wasabiae, including a putative transcriptional regulator SirB, two partially redundant type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters ( Vic1 and Vic2 ) that contain predicted virulence genes. We also found that P. wasabiae lacks a type III secretion system that contributes to virulence in other soft rot species. Our study provides a solid basis for further investigation of the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria.
Mitochondrial protein expression is known to vary depending on the cellular state. However, little is known about how nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins ( mt proteome ) change in response to mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) depletion. In this study, we investigated the systemic alterations of mtDNA-depleted ( ρ0 ) mitochondria by using network analysis of gene expression data. We discovered that up-regulated and down-regulated proteins were organized into two predominant subnetworks that exhibited distinct biological processes. The down-regulated network modules are involved in typical mitochondrial functions, while up-regulated proteins are responsible for mtDNA repair and regulation of mt protein expression and transport. Furthermore, comparisons of proteome and transcriptome data revealed that ρ0 cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression/transport of mt proteins. Our results demonstrate that mt protein composition changed to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states.
In this study, we develop a method to deduce the kinetics of protein synthesis in vivo from the transition rates measured in vitro. We introduce the kinetic distance, a new concept that quantitatively compares the kinetics of a multistep process in different environments. The kinetic distance depends logarithmically on the transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of the underlying free energy barriers. We then minimize the kinetic distance between the in-vitro and in-vivo process, imposing the constraint that the deduced rates reproduce a known global property such as the overall in-vivo speed. We apply this method to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. We describe the process by a codon-specific Markov model with three reaction pathways, corresponding to the initial binding of cognate, near-cognate, and non-cognate tRNA. We determine all individual transition rates in vitro and predict the in-vivo rates by the constrained minimization procedure. We validate these rates by three independent sets of in-vivo data, obtained for codon-dependent translation speeds, codon-specific translation dynamics, and missense error frequencies. We find good agreement between theory and experiment without adjusting any fit parameter. The deduced in-vivo rates lead to smaller error frequencies than the known in-vitro rates, primarily by an improved initial selection of tRNA.
Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that infects the stomach lining of humans and causes chronic gastritis, peptic ulcers, and gastric cancer. In this study, we estimated the short-term rates of mutation and recombination in H. pylori by sequencing an average of 39, 300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates. These isolates included 34 pairs of sequential samples, which were sampled at intervals of 0. 25 to 10. 2 years, as well as single isolates from 29 individuals ( average age: 45 years ) from 10 families. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the rates of mutation, recombination, mean length of recombination tracts, and average diversity in those tracts. Our results indicate that the short-term mutation rate is 1. 4×10−6 to 4. 5×10−6 per nucleotide per year and that three times as many substitutions are introduced by recombination as by mutation. The long-term mutation rate over millennia is 5–17-fold lower, partly due to the removal of non-synonymous mutations due to purifying selection.
Melanopsin, a photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells ( mRGCs ), is known to drive reflex light responses such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. However, until now, there has been no direct assessment of its contribution to conventional visual pathways. Using new reporter lines, we show that mRGC projections are much more extensive than previously thought and extend across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ( dLGN ), the origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. We demonstrate that this input supports extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex in mice lacking rods and cones, a model of advanced retinal degeneration. Moreover, using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanopsin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system, we reveal strong melanopsin input to the ∼40% of neurons in the LGN that show sustained activation to a light step. We show that this melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons. The implication that melanopsin is required to accurately encode stimulus irradiance is confirmed using melanopsin knockout mice. Our data establish melanopsin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods and cones.
HIV-1 infection is associated with an early and profound depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in the regulation of isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies. In this study, we investigated whether the depletion of CD4+ T cells in HIV-1-infected individuals results in altered humoral responses specific to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces. We found that antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals exhibited elevated levels of total and antigen-specific IgM in intestinal secretions, reduced IgG/IgM and IgA/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to microbial and food antigens in intestinal secretions, and reduced IgG levels to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in plasma. These findings indicate reduced competence of mucosal B cells for class switch recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to changing antigenic variety in the gut lumen. The reduced availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may be an important factor contributing to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and their systemic dissemination that drives chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. Furthermore, we found that HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4+ T cell counts exhibited reduced levels of plasma IgG specific to antigens derived from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes.
Populations of species in ecosystems are often constrained by the availability of resources within their environment, leading to a balance between the growth of one population and the decline of others. Here, we propose and model a redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt and severe reduction in the size of a single species, freeing up resources for the remaining ones. This mechanism may be relevant for communities of bacteria, with strain-specific collapses caused by invading bacteriophages, or for other ecosystems where infectious diseases play an important role. The emergent dynamics of our system is characterized by cyclic ‘‘diversity waves’’ triggered by collapses of globally dominating populations. The population diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and exponentially decreases afterwards. Species abundances have a bimodal time-aggregated distribution with the lower peak formed by populations of recently collapsed or newly introduced species and the upper peak formed by species that have not yet collapsed in the current wave. This self-organized hierarchical peak structure has a long-term memory transmitted across several waves, giving rise to a scale-free tail of the time-aggregated population distribution with a universal exponent of 1. 7. We show that diversity wave dynamics is robust with respect to variations in the rules of our model such as diffusion between multiple environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.
Chemotactic movement of Escherichia coli is one of the most well-studied paradigms of simple behavior. Bacteria follow gradients by performing temporal comparisons of chemoeffector concentrations along their runs, a strategy which is most efficient given their size and swimming speed. The chemotaxis system is expected to be strongly optimized due to the significant competitive advantage it confers and the high evolution rates in bacteria. The regulation of tumble probability is commonly assumed to be the only navigation mechanism of chemotactic E. coli. However, we predict the existence of an additional mechanism of gradient navigation in E. coli using computer simulations. We suggest that not only the tumbling probability but also the degree of reorientation during a tumble depend on the swimming direction along the gradient. The difference in mean tumbling angles up and down the gradient is small, but it results in a dramatic enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient. We thus demonstrate a new level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis, which arises from the switching of several flagellar motors and a resulting fine tuning of tumbling angle. Similar strategy is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria, and indicates yet another level of evolutionary development of bacterial chemotaxis.
Thymic medullary epithelial cells ( mTECs ) play a crucial role in establishing central tolerance by expressing self-peptides that delete autoreactive thymocytes or divert them into the regulatory T cell lineage. In addition to the NFκB signaling pathway, we show that Stat3-mediated signaling also plays a key role in mTEC development and homeostasis. We demonstrate that Stat3 activation promotes mTEC survival and is essential for optimal medullary region development and homeostasis. In contrast, conditional deletion of Stat3 disrupts medullary region architecture and reduces mTEC cellularity. Stat3 signaling does not affect mTEC proliferation, but rather promotes survival of immature MHCIIloCD80lo mTEC precursors. We show that targeting a constitutively active Stat3 transgene to the mTEC compartment increases mTEC cellularity and expands the thymic medulla. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 in mTECs reduces mTEC cellularity and impairs medullary region formation. These results demonstrate that in addition to the NFκB pathway, Stat3-mediated signals play an essential role in regulating mTEC cellularity and medullary region homeostasis.
Clostridium difficile is an emergent pathogen and the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhea. In an effort to understand the role of small noncoding RNAs ( sRNAs ) in C. difficile physiology and pathogenesis, we used an in silico approach to identify 511 sRNA candidates in both intergenic and coding regions. RNA–seq and differential 5′-end RNA–seq were used for global identification of C. difficile sRNAs and their transcriptional start sites at three different growth conditions ( exponential growth phase, stationary phase, and starvation ). This approach identified 251 putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans riboregulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 sRNAs was confirmed by gene-specific experimental approaches. Some sRNAs showed growth phase-dependent expression profiles, including an antisense RNA that may be involved in control of C. difficile autolytic activity. Expression of 16 predicted c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches was observed, and experimental evidence for their regulatory role in coordinated control of motility and biofilm formation was obtained. We also detected abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci, which may be important for C. difficile survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities.
Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) core protein downregulates the abundance of the liver-specific microRNA miR-122 by promoting its destabilization via the inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly ( A ) polymerase. The decrease in miR-122 expression results in the dysregulation of its known functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. We found that the 22-nucleotide ( nt ) prototype miR-122 is modified at its 3′ end by 3′-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of miR-122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of any ribonucleotide decreases in liver specimens from patients with HCV. These single-nucleotide-tailed miR-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability over the 22-nt prototype miR-122 and are catalyzed by the unique terminal nucleotidyl transferase activity of GLD-2. The HCV core protein specifically inhibits GLD-2, and its interaction with GLD-2 in the cytoplasm is responsible for miR-122 downregulation. Inhibition of GLD-2 by the HCV core protein affects multiple miRNAs in addition to miR-122 by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers.
Trypanosomes cause disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa, but there has been no evidence of acquired immunity to natural infections until now. We discovered a peak and decrease in age prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei s. l. infection in wild African lions that is consistent with an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with the more genetically diverse species, Trypanosoma congolense s. l. The causative agent of human sleeping sickness, Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, disappears by 6 years of age apparently in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes, including the non-pathogenic subspecies, Trypanosoma brucei brucei. This is the first epidemiological evidence consistent with the development of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in any host species. It is unlikely that some hitherto unknown aspect of innate immunity is responsible for the peak and drop in age-prevalence, because this pattern is only seen in Trypanosoma brucei and not in Trypanosoma congolense. Instead, our observations are consistent with acquired immunity being mounted against Trypanosoma congolense s. l., which allows lions to clear most infections of Trypanosoma brucei s. l. by 3–5 years of age and to eliminate all infections of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense by the age of 6 years.
The role of mechanistic mathematical modeling and systems biology in molecular medicine and clinical development remains uncertain. In this study, we used mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore the hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades, despite model uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, and that these sensitive mechanisms could serve as therapeutic targets. We developed and validated a model of the coagulation cascade, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein–protein interactions, using 21 published datasets generated from two different quiescent in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles in the presence and absence of natural anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0. 87 across all trials. Overall state sensitivity coefficients, which measure the robustness or fragility of a given mechanism, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoagulants, fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X ( fX/FXa ) activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found to be fragile, while fIX/FIXa and fVIII/FVIIIa activation and activity were robust. These results support our hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty.
Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria and have been proposed as antimicrobial agents for the control of pathogenic and other problem bacteria. However, successful application of phage therapy requires a good understanding of the non-linear kinetics of phage–bacteria interactions. Here, we combine experimental and modelling approaches to make a detailed examination of such kinetics for the important food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni and a suitable virulent phage in an in vitro system. We find that phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arise readily and that even a simple model fits the data surprisingly well. We confirm that the so-called inundation and proliferation thresholds are likely to be of considerable practical importance to phage therapy. We fit the model to time series data in order to estimate thresholds and rate constants directly. A comparison of the fit for each culture reveals density-dependent features of phage infectivity that are worthy of further investigation. Our results illustrate how insight from empirical studies can be greatly enhanced by the use of kinetic models: such combined studies of in vitro systems are likely to be an essential precursor to building a meaningful picture of the kinetic properties of in vivo phage therapy.
Schistosomiasis is a devastating disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma that affects over 260 million people worldwide, especially in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The snail Biomphalaria glabrata acts as an obligate intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of intestinal schistosomiasis in Africa and South America. Here, we report the first functional characterization of a snail Toll-like receptor, BgTLR, which plays an important role in the cellular immune response of B. glabrata following challenge with S. mansoni. BgTLR was identified as part of a peptide screen of snail immune cell surface proteins that differed in abundance between B. glabrata snails that differ in their compatibility phenotype to challenge by S. mansoni. The S. mansoni-resistant strain of B. glabrata ( BS-90 ) displayed higher levels of BgTLR compared to the susceptible ( M-line ) strain. Transcript expression of BgTLR was found to be very responsive in BS-90 snails when challenged with S. mansoni, increasing 27 fold relative to β-actin. Knockdown of BgTLR in BS-90 snails via targeted siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, yielding patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails.
Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis mosquitoes are major vectors of infectious diseases in French Polynesia, including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis. To assess the risk of disease transmission and evaluate the efficacy of vector control programmes, we developed an ELISA test to detect and quantify the presence of immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) directed against proteins from salivary gland extracts ( SGE ) of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis in human populations. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Tahiti and Moorea islands, where both mosquito species are present, and found that 98% and 68% of individuals have developed IgG directed against Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE, respectively. In contrast, 97% of individuals from metropolitan France, not exposed to these Aedes mosquitoes, had no IgG directed against SGE of either mosquito species. We also found no ELISA IgG cross-reactivity between Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis SGE, indicating that the IgG response to salivary gland extracts is a valid and specific biomarker of human exposure to the bites of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polynesiensis. This new immuno-epidemiological tool will enhance our understanding of human exposure to mosquito bites, facilitate the identification of areas where disease transmission risk is high, and permit the evaluation of the efficacy of novel vector control strategies in Pacific islands and other tropical settings.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) pathogenicity is linked to its ability to adapt to the intracellular environment of human macrophages. We investigated how Mtb infection influences the metabolic pathways of the host macrophage by examining time-dependent modulations in macrophage metabolism after infection with mycobacterial strains of varying virulence. Our results show that Mtb pathogenicity is intimately linked to its capacity to regulate host cell metabolism, and that this process is controlled at the level of host cell metabolism. We identified a core subset of host reactions that are targeted by Mtb, and found that the goal of regulation is to integrate pathways that facilitate macrophage survival with those that promote mycobacterial sustenance. This integration of host- and pathogen-derived factors defines determinants of pathogenicity. We also found that the requirement for macrophage survival sensitizes TB susceptibility to the glycemic status of the individual, and that mediation by the pathogen ensures that the virulence properties of the infecting strain contribute to the resulting pathology.
Crossover recombination and the formation of chiasmata are essential for the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. We show that ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, is required for crossover recombination. ZHP-3 protein localization is highly dynamic and shifts from along the length of the synaptonemal complex ( SC ) to an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually becomes restricted to foci that mark crossover recombination events. A zhp-3::gfp transgene partially complements a null mutation and reveals a separation of function; although the fusion protein can promote nearly wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among the progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting that the chromosome segregation defect results from an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. We propose that coordination of crossover recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis.
Aedes albopictus, a tropical mosquito species, has become a public health concern in temperate regions of Europe and the US due to its ability to transmit exotic arboviruses and cause severe nuisance problems. In this study, we investigated the effects of eco-climatic factors on the abundance and dynamics of Ae. albopictus in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites in Rome, Italy, which was colonized in 1997 and is now one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. We conducted longitudinal adult mosquito monitoring along a 70 km transect across and beyond the metropolitan area and analyzed the effect of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics using two fine scale spatiotemporal datasets. Our results showed that Ae. albopictus abundance was associated with highly anthropized habitats in both metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas, with “small green islands” corresponding to hot spots of abundance in the metropolitan areas only. We also found a bimodal seasonal dynamics with a second peak of abundance in autumn, due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures.
Phthiocerol dimycocerosates ( DIM ), major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), play a key role in the early step of infection when Mtb encounters host macrophages. Using Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis, we demonstrated that DIM participate both in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. The effects of DIM required a state of the membrane fluidity, as demonstrated by experiments conducted with cholesterol-depleting drugs that abolished the differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification observed between wild-type and mutant strains. The insertion of a new cholesterol-pyrene probe in living cells demonstrated that the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core changed upon contact with Mtb, whereas the lateral diffusion of cholesterol was unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and was consistent with the effect observed following DIM insertion in model membranes. Therefore, we propose that DIM control the invasion of macrophages by Mtb by targeting lipid organisation in the host membrane, thereby modifying its biophysical properties. The DIM-induced changes in lipid ordering favour the efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and contribute to the control of phagosomal pH driving bacilli in a protective niche.
The mean-field approximation is a powerful tool for studying large neural networks, but it fails to describe the behavior of small networks composed of a few tens of neurons. Here, we develop a novel systematic analysis of the dynamics of arbitrarily small networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing-rate neurons. We study the local bifurcations of their neural activity with an approach that is largely analytically tractable, and we numerically determine the global bifurcations. We find that for strong inhibition, these networks give rise to very complex dynamics, caused by the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations that emerge through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This qualitative change of the neural dynamics is a finite-size effect of the network, revealing qualitative and previously unexplored differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The most important consequence of spontaneous symmetry-breaking is the ability of mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, which is thought to help reducing the detrimental effect of noise correlations on cortical information processing.
Leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania, transmitted by the bite of an infected sandfly. In this study, we investigated the presence of Leishmania in extralesional tissues of patients with active dermal leishmaniasis. Extralesional tissues include blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, which are not directly affected by the disease. We used a molecular marker called Leishmania 7SLRNA to determine the viability and burden of Leishmania in these tissues. Our results show that viable parasites are present in extralesional tissues, including blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin of dermal leishmaniasis patients. We detected Leishmania 7SLRNA genes or transcripts in 100% and 73% of patients, respectively, in one or more extralesional tissues. The copy number of 7SLRNA transcripts was correlated with the dose and time dependent reduction of parasite viability in response to the drug Glucantime, substantiating the validity of this target as a marker of viability. We also detected 7SLRNA transcripts in 68% of monocyte samples, 42% of tonsil swabs, 36% of normal skin aspirates, and 88% of lesions. These results demonstrate that Leishmania 7SLRNA is an informative target for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis.
Chromatin features, such as histone modifications ( HMs ) and chromatin binding proteins ( CBPs ), play a fundamental role in regulating DNA replication timing in metazoans. However, no individual HM is strictly indispensable for origin function, suggesting that HMs may act combinatorially in analogy to the histone code hypothesis for transcriptional regulation. Here, we investigated the combinatorial potential of HMs and CBPs for predicting DNA replication timing in Drosophila using quantitative statistical models. We found that while combinations of CBPs exhibit moderate predictive power for replication timing, pairwise interactions between HMs lead to accurate predictions genome-wide that can be locally further improved by CBPs. We developed a simplified, biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication timing that reaches 80% of the full model accuracy using six model terms. We also show that pairwise combinations of HMs are able to predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types. Our results provide support to the existence of combinatorial HM patterns for DNA replication and reveal cell-type independent key elements thereof, whose experimental investigation might contribute to elucidate the regulatory mode of this fundamental cellular process.
Dengue virus serotypes 1–3 are responsible for 390 million infections and at least 25, 000 deaths annually, with the largest disease burden in tropical and subtropical regions. In Brazil, we investigated the spatial dynamics of DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 by applying a statistical framework to complete genome sequences. We estimated that new lineages of all three serotypes were introduced within 7 to 10-year intervals, and were most likely to be imported from the Caribbean region to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, then dispersing at a rate of approximately 0. 5 km/day. Joint statistical analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological and ecological data indicates that aerial transportation of humans and/or vector mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, determines dengue virus spread in Brazil. We characterized the introduction, establishment and drivers of dengue virus spread in Brazil using a combination of genetic and epidemiological data. By applying a flexible phylogeographic approach to full genome sequences, our analyses strongly support a human role for the spread of DENV through aerial transportation of humans and/or mosquito vectors. Our investigation of DENV serotypes 1 to 3 spatiotemporal dispersal indicates distinct introductions and co-circulation of distinct serotypes and genotypes, highlights the impact of air traffic fluxes in the spatial spread of DENV within Brazil and shows that the introduction of new lineages is followed by epizootic amplifications in 7 to 10 year cycles.
Understanding how neural populations encode sensory information remains an important problem in neuroscience. Here we investigated how differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field ( RF ) organization across three parallel sensory maps in weakly electric fish influence correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Using a model based on known anatomical differences in RF center size and overlap, we initially predicted large differences in correlated activity across the maps. However, in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that electrosensory pyramidal neurons across all three segments displayed nearly identical correlations. To explain this surprising result, we incorporated the effects of RF surround in our model. By systematically varying both the RF surround gain and size relative to that of the RF center, we found that multiple RF structures gave rise to similar levels of correlation. In particular, incorporating known physiological differences in RF structure between the three maps in our model gave rise to similar levels of correlation. Our results show that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations, which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity.
In this paper, we investigate how noise correlations between pairs of neurons impact the population's ability to encode a stimulus. We consider a general mathematical setup in which we vary noise correlations while keeping all other aspects of the problem fixed. Our results provide general insights into the problem of population coding. We show that if noise correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs compared to their signal correlations, then coding performance will improve compared to the independent case. This holds for three different metrics of coding performance, and for arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity. We dub this the “sign rule” ( SR ). However, we also show that the SR does not provide a necessary condition for good coding, and that a diverse set of correlation structures can improve coding. Many of these correlation structures violate the SR, as do experimentally observed correlations. We prove that the optimal correlation structures must lie on boundaries of the possible set of noise correlations. Finally, we provide a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions under which the coding performance will be as good as it would be if there were no noise present at all.
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently co-infect patients, leading to treatment failure and significant morbidity and mortality. However, the impact of P. aeruginosa on S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner. We find that P. aeruginosa LasA endopeptidase potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin, rhamnolipids facilitate proton-motive force-independent tobramycin uptake, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide ( HQNO ) induces multidrug tolerance in S. aureus through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP. The production of each of these factors varies between clinical isolates and corresponds to the capacity of each isolate to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that vancomycin treatment of a S. aureus mouse burn infection is potentiated by the presence of a LasA-producing P. aeruginosa population. These findings demonstrate that antibiotic susceptibility is complex and dependent not only upon the genotype of the pathogen being targeted, but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the infection environment.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection is associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, which may contribute to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. We investigated the mechanisms of platelet clearance in patients with dengue and their relationship with thrombocytopenia and platelet reactivity. In two observational cohort studies in Indonesia, we found that patients with dengue had higher plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) antigen and active VWF, and that circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in dengue patients were significantly reduced as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin ( SNA ) and Maackia amurensis lectin II ( MAL-II ) to platelets. Platelet sialylation was also not altered by in vitro exposure of platelets to DENV nonstructural protein 1 or cultured DENV. In contrast, induction of binding of VWF to glycoprotein 1b on platelets using the VWF-activating protein ristocetin resulted in the removal of platelet sialic acid by translocation of platelet neuraminidase to the platelet surface. The neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. Our data demonstrate that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in dengue results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance, and that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in dengue infection.
In this study, we identified the most complete collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters using a database of spliced-expressed sequence tags ( ESTs ). A bidirectional promoter is a regulatory region between two adjacent genes whose transcription start sites are directed away from each other. These promoters are often associated with genes that function in DNA repair and have the potential to participate in the development of cancer. We show that there is a highly significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancer, including a substantial number of genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers. Using microarray expression data from 79 human tissues, we verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. We found that subsets of these promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. This suggests that bidirectional promoters could regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes. We also show that a subset of these promoters, which regulate genes implicated in breast and ovarian cancers, contain transcription factor binding sites in common.
Diptera, the order of flies that includes the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, generally have a conserved karyotype consisting of six chromosomal arms. However, our analysis of 37 fly species belonging to 22 different families of Diptera reveals tremendous hidden diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes. We identify over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations, including species with undifferentiated sex chromosomes, species in which a different chromosome replaced the dot as a sex chromosome, and species in which up to three chromosomal elements became incorporated into the sex chromosomes. We also identify species with female heterogamety ( ZW sex chromosomes ). Transcriptome analysis shows that dosage compensation has evolved multiple times in flies, consistently through up-regulation of the single X in males. We find that X chromosomes generally show a deficiency of genes with male-biased expression, possibly reflecting sex-specific selective pressures. Our data suggest that sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged or replaced multiple times over the course of Diptera evolution.
Zika virus ( ZIKV ) is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen that has been linked to severe fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and hydranencephaly. Between 2009 and 2012, we investigated the presence of ZIKV IgM and IgG antibodies in archived blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 mothers who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii. We used commercially available human ZIKV IgM and IgG ELISA kits to test for the presence of ZIKV antibodies. We found that blood from one mother who delivered a baby with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody ( 16. 6% ) and blood from three mothers tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody ( 50% ). ZIKV IgG antibody positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than mothers who were negative for ZIKV IgG antibodies ( Odds ratio [OR] = 11. 0, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0. 8–147. 9, p = 0. 083 ). Similarly, ZIKV IgM antibody positive mothers were also more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than mothers who were negative for ZIKV IgM antibody ( OR = 6. 8, 95% CI = 0. 2–195. 1, p = 0. 333 ). These data provide further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly and suggest the presence of ZIKV positive cases and associated microcephaly in the United States as early as 2009.
Mycobacterium ulcerans ( MU ) is the causative agent of Buruli ulcer ( BU ), a disease endemic in the Ashanti region of Ghana. In this study, we used Variable Number Tandem Repeat ( VNTR ) typing to source-track MU infections to specific water bodies. We collected environmental samples from 10 water bodies in four BU endemic communities in the Ashanti region, Ghana, and compared them to MU isolates from 14 confirmed BU patients within the same study area. Four VNTR loci in the MU Agy99 genome were used to genotype environmental MU ecovars and those from human samples. Length polymorphism was confirmed with sequencing. We found that MU was present in different types of water bodies, but significantly higher in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes, designated W, X, Y, and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other reported genotypes were only found in water bodies. Our findings suggest that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies. We also present evidence that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections.
The global distribution and drivers of alien bird species richness remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first global analysis of the determinants of alien species richness that takes into account colonisation pressure. Our study uses a database of 27, 723 distribution records for 971 alien bird species worldwide. We show that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven largely by European ( mainly British ) colonialism. However, recent introductions are a wider phenomenon, involving more species and countries, and driven in part by increasing economic activity. We find that, globally, alien bird species richness is currently highest at midlatitudes and is strongly determined by anthropogenic effects, most notably the number of species introduced ( i. e., “colonisation pressure” ). Nevertheless, environmental drivers are also important, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated. Our results demonstrate that colonisation pressure is key to understanding alien species richness, show that areas of high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale, and emphasise the likely ongoing threats to global environments from introductions of species.
Upstream Binding Factor ( UBF ) is a multi-HMGB-box protein involved in RNA polymerase I ( RPI/PolI ) transcription of ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) genes. We show that UBF is essential for rRNA gene transcription and defines the active chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences. UBF is required for the formation of the SL1/TIF1B pre-initiation complex and recruitment of the RPI-Rrn3/TIF1A complex. Loss of UBF is accompanied by recruitment of H3K9me3, canonical histone H1 and HP1α, but not by de novo DNA methylation. Genes retain penta-acetyl H4 and H2A. Z, suggesting that even in the absence of UBF the rRNA genes can maintain a potentially active state. In contrast to canonical histone H1, binding of H1. 4 is dependent on UBF. Unexpectedly, arrest of rRNA synthesis does not suppress transcription of the 5S, tRNA or snRNA genes, nor expression of the several hundred mRNA genes implicated in ribosome biogenesis. Loss of UBF also induces the formation of a large sub-nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body ( NPB ) of oocytes and early embryos. These somatic NPBs contain rRNA synthesis and processing factors but do not associate with the rRNA gene loci ( NORs ).
Wingless/Wnt signaling plays a critical role in tissue patterning and cell fate specification in metazoans. In the adult Drosophila intestine, Wingless ( Wg ) signaling gradients coincide with all major boundaries between compartments. We find that the critical roles of Wg during adult intestinal development, including regulation of target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic ( Dpp ) pathway, are all disrupted by Wg tethering. This indicates that Wg secretion and movement are critical for proper Wg pathway activation during adult gut development. In contrast to the larval wing disc, the adult gut forms through distinct developmental mechanisms that arise during metamorphosis, and faces different functional demands throughout life, including the ability of its epithelium to continuously turnover during homeostasis and to regenerate following injury. Our findings provide new evidence that supports the requirement for the direct, long-range action of Wg in tissue patterning, with relevance for animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease.
Streptococcus pyogenes (GAS) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The ability of GAS to accumulate plasmin at the cell surface is a key process in invasive disease initiation. However, the role of host activators of plasminogen in this process is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) contributes to plasmin recruitment and subsequent invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase was required to facilitate cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of streptokinase, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS strain 5448 during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. Furthermore, GAS were able to mediate a significant increase in the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma. In order to assess the contribution of uPA to invasive GAS disease, a previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection was employed. Both C57/black 6J and AlbPLG1 mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene were significantly more susceptible to invasive GAS disease than uPA−/− mice. The observed decrease in virulence in uPA−/− mice was found to correlate directly with a decrease in bacterial dissemination and reduced cell surface plasmin accumulation by GAS. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis, and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of type IV secretion system ( T4SS ) components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host cell interface. The cag pathogenicity island ( cag PAI ) of H. pylori encodes components of a T4SS that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells, and CagL is a specialized component of the cag T4SS that binds the host receptor α5β1 integrin. We utilized a mass spectrometry-based approach to reveal co-purification of CagL, CagI ( another integrin-binding protein ), and CagH ( a protein with weak sequence similarity to CagL ). These three proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI, and are detectable on the bacterial surface. All three proteins are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells. Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that these proteins are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif is present in CagH, CagI, and CagL. Deletion of these motifs results in abrogation of CagA translocation and IL-8 induction, and the C-terminal motifs of CagI and CagL are required for formation of pili.
Bovine tuberculosis ( bTB ) is a chronic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group of bacteria. Vaccination of cattle might offer a long-term solution for controlling the disease. In this study, calves were vaccinated with BCG or with a heterologous BCG prime adenovirally vectored subunit boosting protocol and challenged with M. bovis to determine protective efficacy. RNA was prepared from PPD-stimulated PBMC from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle and global gene expression was determined by RNA-seq. A total of 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected cattle compared with vaccinated-unprotected and unvaccinated control cattle. Cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction was the most significant pathway related to this dataset with IL-22 expression identified as the dominant surrogate of protection besides INF-γ. The expression of these candidate genes was evaluated by RT-qPCR in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated calves, confirming the importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy.
γ-TuRC and AIR-1 are essential for microtubule nucleation at the centrosome in Caenorhabditis elegans, but their role at non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers ( ncMTOCs ) is largely unknown. We used a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of γ-TuRC and AIR-1 at the apical ncMTOC in C. elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. We found that GIP-1, a core component of γ-TuRC, is required to recruit other γ-TuRC components, including MZT-1, to the apical ncMTOC. In contrast, AIR-1 and MZT-1 are specifically required to recruit γ-TuRC to the centrosome, but not to centrioles or to the apical ncMTOC. Surprisingly, microtubules remain robustly organized at the apical ncMTOC upon γ-TuRC and AIR-1 co-depletion, and upon depletion of other known microtubule regulators. However, loss of GIP-1 removes a subset of dynamic microtubules, and the remaining dynamic microtubules grow faster. These results suggest that different microtubule organizing centers use discrete proteins for their function, and that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources.
Genome phasing is the process of determining the parental origin of the two copies of each chromosome in a diploid human genome. Most human sequencing initiatives do not directly delineate the nucleotide content of the maternal and paternal copies of the 23 chromosomes individuals possess. We compared 11 different widely-used approaches to phasing human genomes using the publicly available ‘Genome-In-A-Bottle’ ( GIAB ) phased version of the NA12878 genome as a gold standard. The approaches included laboratory-based assays that prepare DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing as well as purely computational approaches that seek to reconstruct phase information from general sequencing reads and constructs or population-level haplotype frequency information obtained through a reference panel of haplotypes. We found that a hybrid or combined approach that leverages population-based phasing using the SHAPEIT software suite, genome-wide sequencing read data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. We also found that the inclusion of parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can provide as much as a ten-fold reduction in phasing errors. Finally, we identified DNA sequence signatures associated with the genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which included regions of low polymorphism or SNV density.
Type-III protein secretion systems are used by gram-negative pathogens to secrete proteins into host cells. The flagellar type-III secretion apparatus utilizes both the proton motive force and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation. However, we report that functional flagella can be formed in the absence of type-III ATPase activity by mutations that increase the proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels. We also show that increased proton motive force can bypass the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 virulence-associated type-III ATPase for secretion. Our data support a role for type-III ATPases in enhancing secretion efficiency under limited secretion substrate concentrations and reveal the dispensability of ATPase activity in the type-III protein export process. We demonstrate that type-III protein secretion can efficiently occur in the absence of ATPase activity in both flagellar and virulence-associated type-III secretion systems. We propose that the function of the T3SS-associated ATPase complex is to deliver secretion substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient substrate unfolding. Our findings have important implications for the evolution of the bacterial flagellum and type-III secretion systems.
Bistability plays a central role in the gene regulatory networks ( GRNs ) controlling many essential biological functions, including cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. However, establishing the network topologies that can exhibit bistability remains a challenge. To address this problem, we employed chemical reaction network theory in a comprehensive in silico survey to determine the capacity for bistability of more than 40, 000 simple networks that can be formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. We find that there exist reaction rate constants leading to bistability in ∼90% of these GRN models, including several circuits that do not contain any of the TF cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems. A topological sorting of the two-gene family of networks based on the presence or absence of biochemical reactions reveals eleven minimal bistable networks. The large number of previously unknown bistable network topologies suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises with relative ease and is not easily lost through network evolution. To highlight the relevance of the systematic application of CRNT to bistable network identification in real biological systems, we integrated publicly available protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interaction, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and identified several GRNs predicted to behave in a bistable fashion.
Mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes the enzyme hyaluronidase 2, have been identified as a cause of orofacial clefting and cor triatriatum sinister in humans and mice. Hyaluronidase 2 is responsible for degrading extracellular hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. Mutations in the HYAL2 gene were found to destabilize the enzyme and dramatically reduce protein levels, leading to craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate and cor triatriatum sinister, in affected individuals and mice. In humans, orofacial clefting was identified in all but one affected individual, and craniofacial dysmorphism was a consistent finding. Conductive hearing loss was observed in most affected human subjects, while one individual had profound sensorineural hearing loss. In mice, cor triatriatum sinister and hearing loss were identified as incompletely penetrant features. Our findings highlight the importance of hyaluronidase enzymes for normal human and mouse development and reveal a previously unrecognized pathway involved in the pathogenesis of orofacial clefting, myopia, and cor triatriatum sinister in humans.
Hair cells in the inner ear are responsible for sound detection, and their mechanosensory function is mediated by tip links that interconnect stereocilia and convey force to transduction channels. Current models suggest that tip links have a static composition of protocadherin 15 ( PCDH15 ) at the lower end and cadherin 23 ( CDH23 ) at the upper end. However, we show that functional tip links have at least two molecular compositions: PCDH15/CDH23 and PCDH15/PCDH15. During regeneration, shorter tip links containing nearly equal amounts of PCDH15 at both ends appear first and mediate mechanotransduction currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca2+-dependent decay ( adaptation ). The mature PCDH15/CDH23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. Our findings provide a molecular mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells and could help identify elusive components of the mechanotransduction machinery.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) is the most prevalent arbovirus, causing an estimated 100 million symptomatic dengue infections every year. DENV can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild dengue fever ( DF ) to more life threatening forms such as dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ). The mechanisms that trigger the transition from DF to DHF are not well understood. We performed a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DHF patients at the critical and recovery phases of infection. We identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF at the critical phase, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were up to 5 fold higher in DHF patients compared to DF patients and correlated with liver injury. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in the blood, was 1. 5 fold lower in DHF patients compared to DF patients. This could result in decreased capacity of endogenous antioxidant defense and elevated oxidative stress among DHF patients. In the recovery phase, the levels of eight metabolites were still significantly higher or lower among DHF patients, including chenodeoxyglycocholic acid, one of the bile acids observed at the critical phase. Our study identified altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF in the critical and recovery phases of dengue infection and provided insights into the different host and DENV interactions between DF and DHF.
Trypanosoma brucei, a causative protozoan parasite of African trypanosomiasis, has a unique guanosine 5’-monophosphate reductase ( GMPR ) that catalyzes the deamination of guanosine 5’-monophosphate ( GMP ) to inosine 5’-monophosphate ( IMP ). We identified the GMPR in T. brucei and characterized its recombinant protein to investigate the enzymatic differences between GMPRs of T. brucei and its host animals. We found that T. brucei GMPR has an insertion of a tandem repeat of the cystathionine β-synthase ( CBS ) domain, which is absent in mammalian and bacterial GMPRs. The recombinant protein of T. brucei GMPR catalyzed the conversion of GMP to IMP in the presence of NADPH, and showed apparent affinities for both GMP and NADPH different from those of its mammalian counterparts. Interestingly, the addition of monovalent cations such as K+ and NH4+ to the enzymatic reaction increased the GMPR activity of T. brucei, whereas none of the mammalian GMPR’s was affected by these cations. The monophosphate form of the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibited T. brucei GMPR activity, though mammalian GMPRs showed no or only a little inhibition by it. These results suggest that the mechanism of the GMPR reaction in T. brucei is distinct from that in the host organisms. Finally, we demonstrated the inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting the availability of ribavirin to develop a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.
Voltage-gated sodium channels are transmembrane proteins that initiate action potentials in excitable cells by allowing the rapid influx of sodium ions into the cell. Mutations and aberrant expression of sodium channels are responsible for a range of diseases including neuropathic pain, cardiac arrhythmia, and epilepsy. Sodium channel blockers are used to control electrical excitability in cells as a treatment for these diseases. To develop the next generation of drugs that can selectively target one of the nine types of voltage-gated sodium channels expressed in the body, a better understanding of how current channel blockers work is required. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to examine the route of entry and mechanism of binding in the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb of two channel-blocking drugs: benzocaine and phenytoin. We show that both drugs have two likely binding sites in the pore characterised by nonspecific, hydrophobic interactions: one just above the activation gate, and one at the entrance to the lateral lipid-filled fenestrations. Our simulations highlight the importance of a number of residues in directing drugs into and through the fenestration, and in forming the drug binding sites. We also show that both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with only small energy barriers, suggesting that this can represent the long posited hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs.
MyD88 signaling plays a critical role in the induction of protective host responses upon intestinal infection with the pathogen C. rodentium. Although MyD88-deficient mice are highly susceptible to infection, the cell type-specific contribution of MyD88 in protecting the host against intestinal bacterial infection has been poorly understood. We employed a novel murine knock-in model for MyD88 that enables the cell type-specific reactivation of functional MyD88 expression in otherwise MyD88-deficient mice to investigate the importance of MyD88 in specific immune and nonimmune cell types during intestinal infection. We found that functional MyD88 signaling in CD11c+ cells was sufficient to activate intestinal dendritic cells ( DC ) and to induce the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell ( ILC3 ) response as well as the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells in response to infection with C. rodentium. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to several other cell types, including macrophages ( MO ), T cells or ILC3 did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses upon infection. However, we observed that the functional expression of MyD88 in intestinal epithelial cells ( IEC ) also partially protected the mice during intestinal infection, which was associated with enhanced epithelial barrier integrity and increased expression of the antimicrobial peptide RegIIIγ and the acute phase protein SAA1 by epithelial cells. Together, our data suggest that MyD88 signaling in DC and IEC is both essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses upon intestinal infection with C. rodentium.
Onchocerciasis is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual ivermectin mass drug administration ( MDA ). An immunodiagnostic test, based on the detection of human IgG4 antibodies in the blood to the Onchocerca volvulus-specific antigen Ov16, is one of the recommended tools for determining whether transmission is interrupted and mass treatment can stop. Mathematical modelling was used to explore the relationship between post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children ( measured 1 year after the last round of MDA ) and the duration and coverage of MDA, the mf prevalence in the population, and the probability that onchocerciasis is eventually eliminated. The ONCHOSIM model was extended with new output on the Ov16 antibody serostatus of individuals. Seroconversion was assumed to be triggered by the first worm establishing in the host, with seroconversion occurring either before maturation, after maturation or only after the start of mf production. We are mainly interested in seroconversion rates in children, and for now ignore the possibility of seroreversion to simplify the model. The results show that both the microfiladermia prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and the Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA. The association between either of these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was not influenced much by the assumed treatment coverage levels, but was found to depend on baseline endemicity levels, assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion, and diagnostic test characteristics ( sensitivity and specificity ).
Prions are infectious proteins that can change their properties when propagated in different environments. When prions are grown in cells in the presence of an inhibitory drug, they can become resistant to the drug, and in some cases, they can even become dependent on the drug for propagation. This is because prions are composed of a range of variants with different properties, from which the fittest are selected in a particular environment. When prions are grown in cells in the presence of the drug swainsonine ( swa ), they can become resistant to the drug, and in some cases, they can even become dependent on the drug for propagation. For example, when swainsonine-sensitive 22L prions were grown in PK1 cells in the presence of swa, they became swainsonine-resistant. Similarly, when swainsonine-sensitive RML prions were grown in PK1 cells in the presence of swa, they became swainsonine-resistant and even swainsonine-dependent. The misfolded prion protein ( PrPSc ) associated with swainsonine-dependent variants was less rapidly cleared in PK1 cells than that associated with their drug-sensitive counterparts, indicating that structural differences of the misfolded PrP underlie the properties of the prions. These adaptations are most likely due to conformational changes of the abnormal prion protein.
Metabolism is one of the most ancient and fundamental evolving systems, sustaining life by extracting energy from extracellular nutrients. Here we study metabolism’s potential for innovation by analyzing an exhaustive genotype-phenotype map for a space of 1015 metabolisms that encodes all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism. Using flux balance analysis, we predict the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources which give rise to 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. We find that although viable metabolisms with any one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, their absolute numbers exceed 109 for some phenotypes. Metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that extends far or all the way through metabolic genotype space, where any two genotypes can be reached from each other through a series of single reaction changes. The minimal distance of genotype networks associated with different phenotypes is small, such that one can reach metabolisms with novel phenotypes – viable on new carbon sources – through one or few genotypic changes.
Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, a major public health problem in the Neotropics. Triatoma dimidiata is one of the main vectors of T. cruzi in Mexico. This study analyzed the genetic variation and phylogeography of T. dimidiata haplogroups across the Mexican Neotropics. We analyzed two contiguous fragments of the ND4 gene and found that the lowest genetic diversity of T. dimidiata occurs where there is greatest historical anthropic modification, and where T. cruzi infection prevalence is highest. T. cruzi prevalence was significantly higher than expected in haplogroups 1 and 3, while lower than expected in haplogroup 2. There was also a significant difference of DTUI and DTUVI infection frequencies in both haplogroups 1 and 3, while no difference of either in haplogroup 2. All haplogroups from the Mexican Neotropics had moderate to high haplotype diversity, while greatest genetic differentiation was between haplogroups 1 and 3 ( above FST = 0. 868, p < 0. 0001 ). Divergence of the complex from the MRCA was estimated between 0. 97 MYA ( 95% HPD interval = 0. 55–1. 53 MYA ) and 0. 85 MYA ( 95% HPD interval = 0. 42–1. 5 MYA ) for ND4A and both concatenated fragments, respectively, with primary divergence from the MRCA of haplogroups 2 and 3. This study supports previous ecological niche evidence for the complex´s origin surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus, and provides evidence for recent divergence of three primary dimidiata haplogroups, with differential T. cruzi infection frequency and DTU specificity, important components of vector capacity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome ( HFRS ) is a rodent-borne infectious disease caused mainly by two hantaviruses in China: Hantaan virus ( HTNV ) and Seoul virus ( SEOV ). HFRS is clinically characterized by fever, hemorrhage, headache, back pain, abdominal pain, and acute kidney damage. The main hosts for SEOV are Rattus norvegicus, Rattus flavipectus, and Mus musculus, whereas Apodemus agrarius is the host for HTNV. Transmission of hantavirus to humans occurs via inhalation of aerosolized viral particles present in the urine, feces, and saliva excreted into the environment by rodents infected with it. In China, Hunan Province is one of the areas where HFRS is most highly endemic, with 6, 237 cases of HFRS diagnosed during 2006–2015. Chenzhou, a city with a subtropical climate in Hunan Province, is a typical hotspot for hantavirus infections.
Activating mutations in codon 12/13 of the HRAS proto-oncogene can cause Costello syndrome ( CS ), a congenital disease characterized by postnatal growth retardation, short stature, tumor predisposition, developmental delay, and abnormalities of the heart, skin, and skeletal muscles. The majority of CS cases ( 75% ) are caused by heterozygous c. 34G>A ( p. Gly12Ser ) activating mutations in HRAS. We identified a new germline p. Gly12Val mutation, c. 35_36GC>TG, in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of his HRAS cDNA showed high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild type and mutant HRAS minigenes, we confirmed that c. 35_36GC>TG results in exon 2 skipping by simultaneously disrupting the function of a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer ( ESE ) and creating an Exonic Splicing Silencer ( ESS ). We show that this vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 is caused by a weak 3’ splice site, which makes exon 2 inclusion dependent on binding of splicing stimulatory proteins, like SRSF2, to the critical ESE. We demonstrate that the phenotype in CS and somatic cancers is not only determined by the different transforming potentials of mutant HRAS proteins, but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion resulting from the different HRAS mutations. Finally, we show that a splice switching oligonucleotide ( SSO ) that blocks access to the critical ESE causes exon 2 skipping and halts proliferation of cancer cells.
Methyltransferase-like 3 ( METTL3 ) is a key factor in the formation of N6-methyladenosine ( m6A ) RNA methylation, the most abundant modification on mRNAs. Here, we show that specific inactivation of Mettl3 in the mouse nervous system causes severe developmental defects in the brain. Mettl3 conditional knockout ( cKO ) mice manifest cerebellar hypoplasia caused by drastically enhanced apoptosis of newborn cerebellar granule cells ( CGCs ) in the external granular layer ( EGL ). We found that METTL3 depletion–induced loss of m6A modification causes extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing events, leading to dysregulation of transcriptome-wide gene expression and premature CGC death. Our findings reveal a critical role of METTL3-mediated m6A in regulating the development of the mammalian cerebellum. We conclude that METTL3 is an essential regulator of cerebellar neurogenesis and development. Transcriptome-wide gene expression dysregulation induced by m6A depletion in the absence of METTL3 results in CGCs apoptosis and cerebellum hypoplasia.
Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog are transcription factors that are essential for maintaining the ability of embryonic stem ( ES ) cells to differentiate into any cell type of the developing embryo. In this study, we show that combinatorial binding of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog is strongly associated with co-localization of the transcriptional co-activator Mediator, H3K27ac and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. We observe that the same loci bound by Oct4, Nanog and Sox2 in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. Comparison of mouse and human ES cells shows that less than 5% of individual binding events for Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog are shared between species. However, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53% to 63% of combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved. Our data suggests that the combination of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog binding is critical for transcription in ES cells and likely plays an important role for embryogenesis by binding at conserved early developmental enhancers.
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is initiated by the AML1/ETO oncogenic transcription factor, which is generated by a reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21. AML1/ETO recruits co-repressor complexes to DNA and interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by directly targeting AML1 binding sites. However, AML1/ETO also interacts with other transcription factors, such as E-proteins, and may target other sites on DNA. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling were used to identify AML1/ETO-dependent transcriptional regulation. AML1/ETO was found to co-localize with AML1 and the E-protein HEB on many of its regulated targets. Furthermore, the level of HEB protein was increased in both primary cells and cell lines expressing AML1/ETO. Our results suggest that the functional interaction of AML1/ETO with AML1 and HEB plays a major role in transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein.
Leishmania donovani HAT2 is a constitutively nuclear histone acetyltransferase that acetylates histone H4 at lysine 10 ( H4K10 ) in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of HAT2 in Leishmania donovani cells results in growth and cell cycle defects, as well as poor survival in host cells. We found that HAT2 is essential for the expression of cyclins CYC4 and CYC9, which are involved in S phase and G2/M progression, respectively. CYC4 and CYC9 have their own specific promoters, which are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. HAT2-dependent H4K10 acetylation of these promoters is required for their activation, and depletion of HAT2 results in downregulation of CYC4 and CYC9 expression. This downregulation is responsible for the cell cycle defects observed in HAT2-depleted cells. We also found that transcription of polycistronic units in Leishmania donovani primarily initiates at divergent strand switch regions ( dSSRs ), which are enriched in H4K10 acetylation and H3K4 trimethylation. However, the role of H4K10 acetylation in transcriptional activation from dSSRs in Leishmania donovani is unclear, as a 50% decrease in H4K10 acetylation at dSSRs did not have an impact on gene expression.
Inferring on others' intentions is a fundamental problem during many social transactions. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we applied computational modeling to behavioral data from an economic game in which 16 pairs of volunteers interacted. The game was structured such that the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied in time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, we found that the players' behavior was best explained by the deployment of hierarchical learning: they inferred upon the volatility of the advisers' intentions in order to optimize their predictions about the validity of their advice. Beyond learning, volatility estimates also affected the trial-by-trial variability of decisions: participants were more likely to rely on their estimates of advice accuracy for making choices when they believed that the adviser's intentions were presently stable. Our model of the players' inference predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index ( IRI ) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. Overall, our results suggest that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer on the changing intentions of others, use volatility estimates to inform decision-making in social interactions, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information.
Scrub typhus, an endemic disease in Asia, has traditionally been considered a rural disease. However, indigenous urban cases have been observed in Seoul, South Korea. We investigated the status of indigenous urban scrub typhus and its clinical characteristics in Seoul. Using national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013, we identified 88 cases of urban scrub typhus in Seoul. The possible sites of infection were mountainous areas, city parks, the vicinity of one’s own residence, and riversides. Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gwanak mountain, one of the suspected infection sites in southern Seoul, and 76 ( 87. 4% ) of them were identified as Helenicula miyagawai and 8 ( 9. 2% ) as Leptotrombidium scutellare. Pooled DNA extracted from H. miyagawai mites yielded O. tsutsugamushi Boryong strain. Twenty-six patients from one hospital showed low APACHE II score, low complication rate, and no hypokalemia. We identified the presence of indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul, and a subgroup of them had mild clinical features. The chigger mite H. miyagawai infected with O. tsutsugamushi within the city was found. In endemic areas, urban scrub typhus needs to be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases and a target for prevention.
C. elegans HEN1 homolog, HENN-1, plays a role in the stability of small RNA ( sRNA ) molecules in the germline. HENN-1 mediates methylation of the 3′ ends of sRNA molecules, which is important for their stability. We investigated the effects of HENN-1 on two endogenous sRNA classes in C. elegans, 26G and 21U RNAs, which are involved in RNA interference ( RNAi ) pathways. We found that HENN-1 has differential effects on these two pathways. In the germline, the stability of 21U RNAs is only mildly affected by loss of methylation, and introduction of artificial 21U target RNA does not further destabilize non-methylated 21U RNAs. In contrast, most 26G RNAs display reduced stability and respond to loss of HENN-1 by displaying increased 3′-uridylation frequencies. Within the 26G RNA class, we found that specifically ERGO-1–bound 26G RNAs are modified by HENN-1, while ALG-3/ALG-4–bound 26G RNAs are not. Our data suggest that HENN-1 has a stabilizing effect on ERGO-1-bound 26G RNAs and prevents non-templated uridylation. We also found that loss of HENN-1 results in mild effects on global gene expression in the germline, including down-regulation of many germline-expressed genes.
The first genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) of the human N-glycome has identified a novel role for the transcription factor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α ( HNF1α ) as a master regulator of plasma protein fucosylation. HNF1α and its downstream target HNF4α regulate the expression of genes involved in fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis. We show that HNF1α is both necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. This mechanism has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders.
Centromeres are the attachment points between the genome and the cytoskeleton, where kinetochores bind to spindles and move chromosomes. Paradoxically, the DNA sequence of centromeres has little or no role in perpetuating kinetochores, suggesting that kinetochore assembly is an epigenetic process. We show that maize CENPC, a key inner kinetochore protein, has a DNA-binding domain that is exquisitely sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long, single-stranded nucleic acids strongly promote the binding of CENPC to DNA, and the types of RNAs that stabilize DNA binding match in size and character the RNAs present on kinetochores in vivo. Our data suggest that centromeric RNA helps to recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics. We propose that CENPC is first recruited to kinetochores by protein-protein contacts and then converted to a functional DNA binding protein by centromeric RNA. Our findings are consistent with recent studies showing that RNA facilitates or stabilizes the association of kinetochore proteins with centromeric DNA, and implicate CENPC as a primary target of this activity. In maize, the available data suggest that centromeric DNA does not function to recruit kinetochores until it is combined with specific epigenetic marks.
GWAS have identified genetic variants associated with birth weight ( BW ), childhood obesity ( CO ), and childhood body mass index ( CBMI ). The placenta plays a critical role in fetal development and postnatal health. We examined the role of the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTLs ) in mediating the genetic causes of BW, CO, and CBMI. We found that GWAS loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI were substantially enriched for placental eQTLs ( 6. 76, 4. 83, and 2. 26 folds, respectively ). Importantly, compared to eQTLs of adult tissues, only placental eQTLs contributed significantly to both anthropometric outcomes at birth ( BW ) and childhood phenotypes ( CO/CBMI ). We identified eight, six, and one transcripts that colocalized with BW, CO, and CBMI risk loci, respectively. Our study reveals that placental transcription in utero likely plays a key role in determining postnatal body size, and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity.
Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) is a chronic but not life-threatening disease that is highly relevant in the context of Visceral Leishmaniasis ( VL ) elimination. PKDL occurs in approximately 10–20% of successfully treated VL cases in India and 50–60% of such cases in Sudan. PKDL is characterized by macular, maculopapular or nodular skin lesions caused by Leishmania donovani. In the present study conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India, the prevalence of PKDL was determined to be 27. 5% among antileishmanial antibody positive cases. A total of 26 PKDL cases were detected and treated with either sodium stibogluconate ( SSG ) or oral miltefosine. The sensitivity of species-specific PCR on slit skin smear was 93. 8%, but it has not been applied for routine diagnostic purposes. In this study, the sensitivity of primary PCR was 65. 4%, which increased to 88. 5% in nested PCR. Parasite DNA was detected by PCR in 23 cases with a sensitivity rate of 88. 46%. The rK-39 strip test was positive in all 26 patients, but it is not conclusive for PKDL diagnosis due to the persistence of anti-leishmanial antibodies after L. donovani infections. The study highlights the need for active mass surveys in endemic areas to attain the ultimate goal of eliminating Kala-azar.
Competence is an inducible genetic program in bacteria that enables horizontal gene transfer. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, competence development in liquid cultures is synchronized within the whole cell population and is known to depend on an exported signaling peptide called Competence Stimulating Peptide ( CSP ). However, it is unclear how this CSP-dependent population switch is coordinated. We have found that competence shift in the population relies on a self-activated cell fraction that arises via a growth time-dependent mechanism. This mechanism involves the propagation of competence by contact between activated and quiescent cells. We have demonstrated that CSP remains bound to cells during this event and that the rate of competence development corresponds to the propagation of competence by contact between activated and quiescent cells. We propose that competence initiator cells originate stochastically in response to stress, to form a distinct subpopulation that then transmits the CSP by cell-cell contact. We have validated this two-step cell-contact sensing mechanism by measuring competence development during co-cultivation of strains with altered capacity to produce or respond to CSP. We have also found that the membrane protein ComD retains the CSP, limiting its free diffusion in the medium.
Translocation of the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) L2/viral DNA (vDNA) complex from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the nucleus requires the onset of mitosis. The L2 protein acts as a chaperone to ensure that the vDNA traffics from endosomes to the TGN and eventually the nucleus, where HPV replication occurs. We have developed a system based on subcellular compartmentalization of the enzyme BirA and its cognate substrate to detect membrane translocation of L2-BirA from incoming virions. We find that L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L2/vDNA at the TGN; only release and progression past G2/M enables translocation across the limiting membrane and subsequent infection. Microscopy of EdU-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid and dramatic shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis. At late G2/early prophase vDNA egresses from the TGN to a pericentriolar location, accumulating there through prometaphase where it begins to associate with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and throughout anaphase the vDNA is seen bound to the mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into both daughter nuclei. Mutations in a newly defined chromatin binding region of L2 potently blocked translocation, suggesting that translocation is dependent on chromatin binding during prometaphase.
We present a mathematical framework for estimating the relative transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. The method is applied to data from competitive mixtures experiments in which animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. We use data from influenza experiments in ferrets to demonstrate the approach. The relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another is important in at least three contexts: seasonal/seasonal interactions, seasonal/pandemic interactions, and NAI-resistant/NAI-sensitive interactions. The mathematical framework introduced here also provides an estimate for the size of the transmitted inoculum. We demonstrate the framework's behaviour using data from ferret transmission studies, and through simulation suggest how to optimise experimental design for assessment of transmissibility. The method introduced here for assessment of mixed transmission events has applicability beyond influenza, to other viral and bacterial pathogens.
The integration of light and abscisic acid ( ABA ) signaling pathways is crucial for plant adaptation and survival. In this study, we show that BBX21, a B-box protein involved in seedling photomorphogenesis, also plays a role in ABA signaling. Our genetic data indicate that BBX21 may act upstream of several ABA INSENSITIVE ( ABI ) genes and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 ( HY5 ) in ABA control of seed germination. We further demonstrate that BBX21 negatively regulates ABI5 expression by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. In addition, we show that ABI5 directly activates its own expression, and that BBX21 negatively regulates this activity by directly interacting with ABI5. Together, these findings indicate that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter and that these transcriptional regulators work in concert to integrate light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana.
The Mediator complex is an essential co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved throughout eukaryotes. Here we present the first study of Mediator in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. We focused on the Middle domain subunit Med31, the Head domain subunit Med20, and Srb9/Med13 from the Kinase domain. The C. albicans Mediator shares some roles with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, such as functions in the response to certain stresses and the role of Med31 in the expression of genes regulated by the activator Ace2. The C. albicans Mediator also has additional roles in the transcription of genes associated with virulence, for example genes related to morphogenesis and gene families enriched in pathogens, such as the ALS adhesins. Consistently, Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, filamentation, and biofilm formation; and ALS1 is a biologically relevant target of Med31 for development of biofilms. Furthermore, Med31 affects virulence of C. albicans in the worm infection model. We present evidence that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in the expression of the genes encoding cell wall adhesins are different between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans: they are repressors of the FLO genes in S. cerevisiae and are activators of the ALS genes in C. albicans.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms have been shown to exhibit higher antibiotic tolerance than their planktonic counterparts. However, the degree to which the biofilm-specific cellular state and its constituent genetic determinants contribute to this hyper-tolerant phenotype is not well understood. To address this question, we used genome-wide functional profiling of a complex, heterogeneous mutant population of P. aeruginosa MPAO1 in biofilm and planktonic growth conditions with and without tobramycin to systematically quantify the contribution of each locus to antibiotic tolerance under these two states. We identified large sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or planktonic setting only, offering global insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and planktonic antibiotic tolerance. Our mixed population-based experimental design recapitulated the complexity of natural biofilms and, unlike previous studies, revealed clinically observed behaviors including the emergence of quorum sensing-deficient mutants. Our study revealed a substantial contribution of the cellular state to the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms, providing a rational foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections.
Complex biological systems are difficult to analyse due to the multitude of interacting components and the lack of information about the essential dynamics. Model selection algorithms that evaluate the performance of a multitude of different models against experimental data provide a useful tool to identify appropriate model structures. However, many algorithms addressing the analysis of complex dynamical systems compare a preselected number of models or rely on exhaustive searches of the total model space, which might be unfeasible. Therefore, we developed a Flexible and dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection ( FAMoS ) that is able to perform model selection on complex systems and searches large model spaces in a dynamical way. Our algorithm includes local and newly developed non-local search methods that can prevent the algorithm from ending up in local minima of the model space by accounting for structurally similar processes. We tested and validated the algorithm based on simulated data and showed its flexibility for handling different model structures. We also used the algorithm to analyse experimental data on the cell proliferation dynamics of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were cultured under different conditions. Our analyses indicated dynamical changes within the proliferation potential of cells that was reduced within tissue-like 3D ex vivo cultures compared to suspension. Due to the flexibility in handling various model structures, the algorithm is applicable to a large variety of different biological problems and represents a useful tool for the data-oriented evaluation of complex model spaces.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major public health problem in Bolivia. In 2006, the National Program for Chagas disease was implemented in Bolivia, resulting in a significant decrease in the number of infections through vector control. Subsequently, a treatment regimen of benznidazole ( BNZ ) was started in seropositive school-age children living in certified vector control areas. We conducted a 12-month follow-up study to evaluate the efficacy of BNZ treatment in seropositive children. Blood samples were taken during and after treatment, and serology, conventional diagnostic PCR ( cPCR ), and quantitative Real-time PCR ( qPCR ) were performed. Plasma Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines levels were also determined. Among 57 children who completed follow-up, 6 ( 11% ) showed both cPCR ( + ) and qPCR ( + ) ( non reactive ), 24 ( 42% ) cPCR ( - ) but qPCR ( + ) ( ambiguous ), and 27 ( 47% ) cPCR ( - ) and qPCR ( - ) ( reactive ). IL-17A levels were significantly higher in seropositive children before treatment compared to age-matched seronegative children and decreased to normal levels one year after treatment. Moreover, IL-17A levels were positively correlated with parasite counts detected by qPCR. At the 12 months’ time point, IL-17A levels of non-reactive subjects were significantly higher than those of reactive or ambiguous subjects, suggesting that IL-17A might be useful to determine the reactivity to BNZ treatment.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary causative agent of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, with almost 2% occupied by a diminutive transposon called the Correia element ( CE ). Here, we report a bioinformatic analysis defining eight subtypes of the CE with four distinct types of ends. Transcriptional analysis using PCR and a lacZ reporter system revealed that two ends in particular encode strong promoters. The activity of the strongest promoter is dictated by a recurrent polymorphism ( Y128 ) at the right end of the element. We show that CEs can drive transcription of adjacent genes and may express small non-coding RNAs. Pair-wise comparisons between three meningococcal genomes revealed that no more than two-thirds of CEs maintain their subtype at any particular locus, due to recombinational class switching between elements in a single strain. This process may represent a hitherto unrecognized mechanism for phase variation in the meningococcus. We conclude that the strain-to-strain variability of the CEs, and the large number of strong promoters encoded by them, allows for potentially widespread effects within the population as a whole.
Cochliobolus heterostrophus is a maize pathogen that produces a wealth of secondary metabolites, including the host selective toxin T-toxin. T-toxin is produced by race T and promotes high virulence to maize carrying Texas male sterile cytoplasm ( T-cms ). T-toxin production is significantly increased in the dark in wild type ( WT ), whereas Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutant toxin levels are much reduced in the dark compared to WT. Correspondingly, expression of T-toxin biosynthetic genes ( Tox1 ) is up-regulated in the dark in WT, while dark-induced expression is much reduced/minimal in Chvel1 and Chlae1 mutants. Toxin production and Tox1 gene expression are increased in ChVEL1 overexpression ( OE ) strains grown in the dark and in ChLAE1 strains grown in either light or dark, compared to WT. These observations establish ChLae1 and ChVel1 as the first factors known to regulate host selective toxin production. ChLae1 and ChVel1 positively regulate T-toxin biosynthesis, pathogenicity and super virulence, oxidative stress responses, sexual development, and aerial hyphal growth, and negatively control melanin biosynthesis and asexual differentiation.
Bacterial Nav channels have been characterized as functionally asymmetric, and the mechanism of this asymmetry has not been clearly understood. To address this question, we combined non-equilibrium simulation data with two-dimensional equilibrium unperturbed landscapes generated by umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Analysis Methods for multiple ions traversing the selectivity filter of bacterial NavAb channel. The non-equilibrium simulations indicate that two or three extracellular K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter of NavAb in the presence of applied forces in the inward direction, but not in the outward direction. The block state occurs in an unstable local minimum of the equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscape of two K+ ions that can be ‘locked’ in place by modest applied forces. In contrast, three Na+ ions move favorably through the selectivity filter together as a unit in a loose “knock-on” mechanism of permeation in both inward and outward directions, and there is no similar local minimum in the two-dimensional free-energy landscape of two Na+ ions for a block state. The useful work predicted by the non-equilibrium simulations that is required to break the K+ block is equivalent to large applied potentials experimentally measured for two bacterial Nav channels to induce inward currents of K+ ions. These results illustrate how inclusion of non-equilibrium factors in the simulations can provide detailed information about mechanisms of ion selectivity that is missing from mechanisms derived from either crystal structures or equilibrium unperturbed free-energy landscapes.
Rabies virus spreads more slowly in the paralytic form of canine rabies compared to the furious form. This is evident from the amount of rabies viral antigen present in the cell processes of the brain and spinal cord. In the furious form, rabies virus rapidly colonizes the cerebral hemispheres, as measured by viral antigen within neuronal cell bodies and viral RNA levels. In contrast, in the paralytic form, there is a delay in cell process involvement following cell body involvement, consistent with replication occurring in the cell body region and subsequent transport out to cell processes. The amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes decreases in a rostral direction, following the pattern for the amount of rabies viral antigen in neuronal cell bodies and the percentage of involved cell bodies. However, the amount of antigen in cell processes is greater in dogs with the furious form compared to the paralytic form, at all anatomic levels examined. This suggests that intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, resulting in slower viral propagation. Possible mechanisms might involve host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, which could be cytokine-mediated, since previous studies have documented greater inflammation in the paralytic form.
CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) is a zinc-finger protein that plays an important role in the regulation of transcription by preventing inappropriate interactions between enhancers and promoters. In vertebrates, CTCF is well characterised as an enhancer-blocking factor, but its function in Drosophila has only recently been characterised. To date, only one endogenous binding location for CTCF has been identified in the Drosophila genome, the Fab-8 insulator in the Bithorax complex ( BX-C ). We used chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites within representative regions of the Drosophila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the BX-C, and the Antennapedia complex. We identified CTCF binding sites in the BX-C that map precisely to the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. We also identified three additional presumptive insulator elements; “Fab-2, ” “Fab-3, ” and “Fab-4. ” Our data indicate that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, suggesting that the functioning of these insulators involves a common CTCF-dependent mechanism.
Peptide deformylase ( PDF ) is a metal cation-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the removal of the N-formyl group from the N-terminus of nascent polypeptide chains. Here, we provide a detailed mechanism for the induced-fit process that occurs during the binding of a slow, tight-binding inhibitor, actinonin, to PDF. We solved the crystal structures of the initial open state and final closed state of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, as well as several intermediate mimics captured during the binding process. Our results show that the binding of actinonin induces a conformational change in the enzyme, resulting in the closure of the active site. This closure is driven by the ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket and is further stabilized by additional binding interactions. Together with biochemical analyses, these data allow us to reconstruct the sequence of events leading from the encounter complex to the key-lock binding state of the enzyme.
The thalamus acts as the primary gateway for relaying sensory information to the cerebral cortex. However, the influence of the functional loop between the thalamus and cortex remains largely unexplored during sensory processing. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, we implemented a hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway combining biological cells and simulated circuits. We mimicked the synaptic bombardment of cortical origin through the injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable correlation level of afferent activity shared by thalamic cells. Our results show that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: i ) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, ii ) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment and iii ) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. Counterintuitively, our results demonstrate that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. We propose that active decorrelation of background synaptic activity in the thalamic layer provides a powerful optimization mechanism controlling the efficiency of the retinocortical signal transfer.
The putative DNA demethylase NMAD-1 plays a critical role in regulating DNA replication and repair during meiosis in the Caenorhabditis elegans germline. NMAD-1 mutants have reduced fertility and show defects in prophase I of meiosis, which leads to reduced embryo production and an increased incidence of males due to defective chromosomal segregation. In nmad-1 mutant worms, nuclear staging beginning at the leptotene and zygotene stages is disorganized, the cohesin complex is mislocalized at the diplotene and diakinesis stages, and chromosomes are improperly condensed, fused, or lost by the end of diakinesis. RNA sequencing of the nmad-1 germline revealed reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes during meiosis, which was coupled with delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. NMAD-1 binds to multiple proteins that regulate DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2, and co-localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin. Moreover, the majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NMAD-1. These results suggest that NMAD-1 functions at DNA replication sites to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis.
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause disease in newborns and immunocompromised patients. HCMV has a large genome and can infect a wide range of human cells, but the mechanism of HCMV infection remains a mystery. Here, we report the identification of adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein ( APMAP ) as a novel modulator of HCMV infection. APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts; knockdown of APMAP expression significantly reduced HCMV infection of these cells. Interestingly, ectopic expression of human APMAP in cells refractory to HCMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, promoted HCMV infection. Furthermore, reduction in viral immediate early ( IE ) gene transcription at 6 h post infection and delayed nucleus translocation of tegument delivered pp65 at 4 h post infection were detected in APMAP-deficient cells but not in wildtype cells. These results suggest that APMAP plays a role in the early stage of HCMV infection. Biochemical studies of APMAP and HCMV proteins suggest that APMAP could participate in HCMV infection through interaction with gH/gL containing glycoprotein complexes at low pH and mediate nucleus translocation of tegument pp65. Taken together, our results suggest that APMAP functions as a modulator promoting HCMV infection in multiple cell types and is an important player in the complex HCMV infection mechanism.
Hematopoiesis is the process by which blood cells are produced from hematopoietic progenitor cells. Lineage commitment during hematopoiesis is the process by which a progenitor cell commits to a specific lineage of blood cells, such as erythrocytes, granulocytes, or megakaryocytes. Lineage commitment can be influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include the differential expression of lineage-specific transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate gene expression. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, include cytokines, which are signaling molecules produced by other cells that can influence the behavior of hematopoietic progenitor cells. Here, we present a mathematical model of lineage commitment that combines both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Our model suggests that cytokine-mediated positive receptor feedback can induce a “switch-like” response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. The model further suggests that cell fates are ultimately driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating these inherently noisy cell-fate decisions. Our model also shows good agreement with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis that have been observed experimentally.
Orthobunyaviruses are an expanding group of emerging viruses that pose a threat to human and animal health. Despite their medical importance, little is known about their structure, which is essential for understanding virus assembly and entry into host cells. Here, we report the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, the prototypic member of this genus, using electron cryo-tomography. We show that Bunyamwera virions are pleomorphic in shape and display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes. Each spike protrudes 18 nm from the viral membrane and becomes disordered upon introduction to an acidic environment. Using sub-tomogram averaging, we derived a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike to 3-nm resolution. The glycoprotein spike consists mainly of the putative class-II fusion glycoprotein and exhibits a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein–protein contacts between neighbouring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike contacts at membrane-distal regions. This trimeric assembly deviates from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a greater than anticipated repertoire of viral fusion glycoprotein oligomerization. Our study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of this group of emerging pathogens.
Primary angle closure glaucoma ( PACG ) is a major cause of irreversible blindness, particularly in Asian countries. We conducted a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) on a total of 5, 308 population-based individuals of Asian descent to identify novel genes associated with PACG. We discovered that a sequence variant within the ABCC5 gene ( rs1401999 ) is associated with a decrease in anterior chamber depth ( ACD ) of 0. 045 mm ( P = 8. 17×10−9 ). This locus was also associated with an increase in risk of PACG in a separate case-control study of 4, 276 cases and 18, 801 controls ( per-allele OR = 1. 13 [95% CI: 1. 06–1. 22], P = 0. 00046 ). The association was strengthened when a sub-group of controls with open angles were included in the analysis ( per-allele OR = 1. 30, P = 7. 45×10−9; 3, 458 cases vs. 3, 831 controls ). Our findings suggest that the increase in PACG risk could in part be mediated by genetic sequence variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions.
Deuterostomes and protostomes are two clades of bilaterian animals that share a common developmental toolkit, including conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. However, previous studies have found no regulatory sequence conserved between the two clades. Here, we describe the first examples of developmental enhancers conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes, which we call bilaterian conserved regulatory elements ( Bicores ). Bicores show conservation of sequence and gene synteny, and sequence conservation reflects conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites. We predict that Bicores act as response elements to signaling pathways, and we show that Bicores are developmental enhancers that drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system.
Influenza virus diversity and antigenic drift have been well characterized on a global scale, but the factors that influence the virus’ rapid evolution within and between human hosts are less clear. We used next generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and to define the impact of vaccine-induced immunity on within-host populations. We identified 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over 3 seasons and 5119 person-years, and obtained whole genome sequence data for 119 samples. Phylogenetic analysis of consensus hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season hemagglutination inhibition and neuraminidase inhibition titers, respectively. We found that the vast majority of intrahost single nucleotide variants were rare and that very few were found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the entire genome, and the level of diversity did not significantly vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. Our data indicate that seasonal influenza vaccination has little impact on intrahost diversity in natural infection and that vaccine-induced immunity may be only a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales.
Visceral leishmaniasis is a severe disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of live attenuated L. donovani parasites ( LdCen-/- ) in inducing a protective immune response in young and aged mice. We previously showed that LdCen-/- parasites induce a strong protective immune response in young mice. In this study, we analyzed the immune response in aged mice ( 18 months ) and compared it to young mice ( 2 months ). We found that LdCen-/- infection significantly enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-12, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF ) and down-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines ( IL-10 ) in bone marrow derived dendritic cells ( BMDCs ) from both young and aged mice. We also found that LdCen-/- immunization induced higher IgG2a antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine responses, and stimulated splenocytes for heightened leishmanicidal activity associated with nitric oxide production in young and aged mice. Upon challenge with virulent L. donovani parasites, LdCen-/- immunized mice from both age groups displayed multifunctional Th1-type CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 T cells correlating to a significantly reduced parasite burden in the spleen and liver compared to naïve mice.
Enteric and respiratory enteroviruses ( EVs ) have distinct biophysical properties and cause a wide range of human pathologies despite their genetic similarities. We generated chimeras at the capsid level between EV-D68 ( a respiratory EV ) and EV-D94 ( an enteric EV ) to investigate the underlying cause of these differences. We found that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and in respiratory, intestinal and neural tissues. Additionally, capsid genes also participate in determining the optimal growth temperature, since EV-D94 temperature adaptation relied on single mutations in VP1, while constructs with EV-D68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures. We also demonstrated that EV-D68 maintains residual binding capacity after acid treatment despite a loss of infectivity. In contrast, non-structural proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 ( HSV-1 ) glycoprotein gE-gI is a transmembrane Fc receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G ( hIgG ). gE-gI can also participate in antibody bipolar bridging ( ABB ), a process by which the antigen-binding fragments ( Fabs ) of the IgG bind a viral antigen while the Fc binds to gE-gI. The fate of viral antigens associated with gE-gI–bound IgG had been unknown: they could remain at the cell surface or be endocytosed with IgG. Here, we developed an in vitro model system for ABB and investigated the trafficking of ABB complexes using 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging of ABB complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth factor, well-characterized intracellular trafficking markers. Our data showed that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI–dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. These results suggest that gE-gI can mediate clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens to evade IgG-mediated responses, representing a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.
Echinococcus granulosus is the causative agent of cystic hydatid disease ( CHD ), which affects humans and domestic animals worldwide. The larval stages of the parasite, including the protoscoleces ( PSCs ), can interact with both definitive and intermediate hosts. However, our understanding of how PSCs subvert the immune response of hosts and maintain metabolic adaptation remains unclear. In this study, we used Roche 454 sequencing technology and in silico secretome analysis to explore the transcriptome profiles of E. granulosus PSCs and elucidate the potential functions of the excretory-secretory proteins ( ESPs ) released by the parasite. We generated 26, 514 nonredundant sequences, of which 22, 910 ( 86. 4% ) were mapped to the newly published E. granulosus genome and 17, 705 ( 66. 8% ) were distributed within the coding sequence ( CDS ) regions. We predicted 2, 280 ESPs, of which 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism and 124 were involved in protein metabolism. Eleven ESPs were identified as intracellular enzymes that regulate glycolysis/gluconeogenesis ( GL/GN ) pathways, while 44 antigenic proteins, 25 molecular chaperones and four proteases were highly represented. Many proteins were also found to be significantly enriched in development-related signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β receptor pathways and insulin pathways. This study provides valuable information on the metabolic adaptation of parasites to their hosts that can be used to aid the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control.
Nitrate assimilation is a tightly regulated process in microorganisms and plants. In Aspergillus nidulans, the transcription factor NirA plays a key role in the transcriptional activation of nitrate assimilatory genes. The interaction between NirA and the exportin KapK/CRM1 is disrupted in the presence of nitrate, leading to rapid nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of NirA. We found that in the absence of nitrate, when NirA is inactive and predominantly cytosolic, methionine 169 in the nuclear export sequence ( NES ) is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide ( Metox169 ). This oxidation is dependent on FmoB, a flavin-containing monooxygenase, and is independent of thioredoxin and classical methionine sulfoxide reductases. In the presence of nitrate, NirA-Metox169 is rapidly reduced to Met169. Replacement of Met169 with isoleucine, a sterically similar but not oxidizable residue, led to partial loss of NirA activity and insensitivity to FmoB-mediated nuclear export. In contrast, replacement of Met169 with alanine transformed the protein into a permanently nuclear and active transcription factor. We propose that in the presence of nitrate, the activation domain of NirA is exposed, but the NES is masked by a central portion of the protein ( termed nitrate responsive domain, NiRD ), thus restricting active NirA molecules to the nucleus. In the absence of nitrate, Met169 oxidation leads to loss of protection by the NiRD, NES exposure, and relocation of the inactive NirA to the cytosol.
Voltage-gated sodium channels are essential for the propagation of action potentials in mammalian cells. Mathematical models have suggested that sodium channel properties need to be tightly constrained for an action potential to propagate. There are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels, many of which are more than 90% identical by sequence. This sequence similarity presumably corresponds to similarity of function, consistent with the idea that these properties must be tightly constrained. However, the multiplicity of genes encoding sodium channels raises the question of why there are so many. We demonstrate that the simplest theoretical constraints bounding sodium channel diversity—the requirements of membrane excitability and the uniqueness of the resting potential—act directly on constraining sodium channel properties. We compare the predicted constraints with functional data on mammalian sodium channel properties collected from the literature, including 172 different sets of measurements from 40 publications, wild-type and mutant, under a variety of conditions. The data from all channel types, including mutants, obeys the excitability constraint; on the other hand, channels expressed in muscle tend to obey the constraint of a unique resting potential, while channels expressed in neuronal tissue do not. The excitability properties alone distinguish the nine sodium channels into four different groups that are consistent with phylogenetic analysis.
Influenza virus polymerase is an attractive target for antiviral drugs because it is essential for viral transcription and replication. The endonuclease domain of the PA subunit of the heterotrimeric polymerase has been identified as a good target for drug development, as its inhibition could directly stop viral replication at an early stage. Here, we report high resolution X-ray co-crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 ( pH1N1 ) PA endonuclease domain with a series of specific inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin, all of which chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme. Our results show that different substituent groups on the basic metal binding scaffold can be orientated to bind in distinct sub-pockets within the active site cavity, and that certain structural elements of the active site cavity are plastic and result in induced fit binding. These findings will be important in optimising the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza virus polymerase.
The aim of the present study was to develop an effective immunization protocol for the production of potent polyspecific antisera against the medically important vipers of Thailand and its neighboring countries, namely Calloselasma rhodostoma, Cryptelytrops albolabris and Daboia siamensis. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the 3 viper venoms using the ‘low dose, low volume multi-site’ immunization protocol. The antisera showed rapid rise in ELISA titers against the 3 venoms and reached plateau at about the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against CA, CR and DS venoms was 10. 40, 2. 42 and 0. 76 mg/ml, respectively, and was much higher than the minimal potency limits set by Queen Soavabha Memorial Institute ( QSMI ). The corresponding potency values for the QSMI monospecific antisera against CA, CR and DS venoms were 7. 28, 3. 12 and 1. 50 mg/ml, respectively. The polyspecific antisera also effectively neutralized the procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic and nephrotoxic activities of the viper venoms. This effective immunization protocol should be useful in the production of potent polyspecific antisera against snake venoms, and equine antisera against tetanus, diphtheria or rabies.
Salmonella typhimurium, a host-adapted strain of Salmonella enterica, causes systemic infections that can persist for long periods of time despite the presence of a robust immune response. We show that the bacterial effector protein SseI, translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 ( SPI2 ) type III secretion system ( T3SS ), is required for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain a long-term chronic systemic infection in mice. SseI inhibits normal cell migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells ( DC ) in vitro, and such inhibition requires the host factor IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 ( IQGAP1 ). SseI binds directly to IQGAP1 and co-localizes with this factor at the cell periphery. The C-terminal domain of SseI is similar to PMT/ToxA, a bacterial toxin that contains a cysteine residue ( C1165 ) that is critical for activity. Mutation of the corresponding residue in SseI ( C178A ) eliminates SseI function in vitro and in vivo, but not binding to IQGAP1. In addition, infection with wild-type ( WT ) S. typhimurium suppressed DC migration to the spleen in vivo in an SseI-dependent manner. Correspondingly, examination of spleens from mice infected with WT S. typhimurium revealed fewer DC and CD4+ T lymphocytes compared to mice infected with ΔsseI S. typhimurium.
Community acquired-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) is more virulent than hospital associated-MRSA ( HA-MRSA ) and causes severe disease in healthy individuals. The underlying mechanism for the high virulence of CA-MRSA is not known. Here, we report that the transcription product of the psm-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec of HA-MRSA, but not CA-MRSA, suppresses the expression of phenol-soluble modulin α ( PSMα ), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. We found that psm-mec RNA inhibits translation of the agrA gene encoding a positive transcription factor for the PSMα gene via specific binding to agrA mRNA. Furthermore, 25% of 325 clinical MRSA isolates had a mutation in the psm-mec promoter that attenuated transcription, and 9% of the strains had no psm-mec. In most of these psm-mec-mutated or psm-mec-deleted HA-MRSAs, PSMα expression was increased compared with strains carrying intact psm-mec, and some mutated strains produced high amounts of PSMα comparable with that of CA-MRSA. Deletion of psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains carrying intact psm-mec increased the expression of AgrA protein and PSMα, and virulence in mice. Thus, psm-mec RNA suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of agrA translation and the absence of psm-mec function in CA-MRSA causes its high virulence property.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection can lead to severe disease in individuals who have previously been infected with a different DENV serotype, a phenomenon known as antibody-mediated disease enhancement ( ADE ). ADE occurs when heterologous or sub-neutralizing homologous antibodies bind to DENV particles but fail to neutralize them, allowing Fc-receptor mediated entry of the virus-antibody complexes into host cells. This results in enhanced viral replication and heightened inflammatory responses. Here, we report a novel mouse model of ADE that is mediated by maternal antibodies in type I interferon receptor-deficient A129 mice. We show that 5-week old A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers succumbed to a DENV2 infection within 4 days that was sub-lethal in mice born to naïve mothers. Clinical manifestations included extensive hepatocyte vacuolation, moderate vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNFα therapy totally protected the mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes. In contrast, blocking IL-6 did not impact the virus titers or disease outcome. This A129 mouse model of ADE may help dissect the mechanisms involved in dengue pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates.
Visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum, is a major public health concern in the Americas. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies was conducted to identify factors associated with the disease in humans in the Americas. The results showed that male sex was associated with visceral leishmaniasis in studies that used the leishmanin skin test for diagnosis and in those where the outcome was the clinical disease. In contrast, younger individuals were less frequently infected than adults, but were more prone to illness. The presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were also associated with L. infantum infection. However, the presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status were not associated with the disease. Ecological studies showed consistent evidence that dog seropositivity is associated with human visceral leishmaniasis, emphasizing the relevance of dogs as a marker of disease occurrence.
Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is a highly virulent bacterium that causes acute and fatal pneumonia following inhalation of as few as 10 colony forming units ( cfu ) of the highly virulent SchuS4 strain. In contrast, the less virulent LVS strain requires higher bacterial numbers to cause lethal infection. The mechanisms underlying acute pathogenesis and death in pulmonary tularemia remain unknown. Here, we show that an overt innate cellular response to Francisella tularensis, rather than overwhelming bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives tissue pathology and host mortality. This response is characterized by the recruitment of large numbers of immature myeloid cells ( IMC ) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells ( MDSC ) to the lungs and spleen. These cells fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of pulmonary function, and host death that is partially dependent upon immature Ly6G+ cells. In contrast, during sub-lethal infection with Francisella tularensis LVS, the pulmonary cellular response is characterized by a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes required for protection. This study reveals that the nature of the myeloid cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection.
Aedes albopictus, also known as the Asian tiger mosquito, is a vector of medically important arboviruses such as chikungunya ( CHIKV ), dengue ( DENV ), and Zika ( ZIKV ). This mosquito is an invasive species that has spread rapidly across the globe, raising concerns about the potential for infectious disease transmission. In order to mitigate its spread and the associated disease risks, it is essential to understand the complex colonization pattern of Aedes albopictus. In this study, we combined classical population genetics analyses and Approximate Bayesian Computation ( ABC ) approaches to reconstruct the demographic history of Aedes albopictus populations from representative countries in the Southeast Asian native range and in the more recently colonized areas. Our results indicate that, in the native range, populations from China, Thailand, and Japan maintain high genetic connectivity, revealing their ancestral common origin. In contrast, the invasion process outside of Southeast Asia is primarily supported by a chaotic propagule distribution mediated by human activity, resulting in a relatively high genetic diversity within the adventive populations. Our data suggest that independent and trans-continental introductions of Aedes albopictus may have facilitated the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause chronic infections in humans, particularly in wounds. While much is known about the pathogenesis of acute infections, the understanding of chronic infections has lagged. Here we sought to identify the genes and functions that mediate the fitness of P. aeruginosa in chronic wound infections, and to better understand the selective environment in wounds. We found that clinical isolates from chronic human wounds were frequently defective in virulence functions and biofilm formation, and that many virulence and biofilm formation genes were not required for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. In contrast, genes involved in anaerobic growth, some metabolic and energy pathways, and membrane integrity were critical. We also found that the fitness characteristics of some wound-impaired mutants could be represented by anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane-stress conditions ex vivo, and more comprehensively by high-density bacterial growth conditions, in the absence of a host. These data shed light on the bacterial functions needed in chronic wound infections, the nature of stresses applied to bacteria at chronic infection sites, and suggest therapeutic targets that might compromise wound infection pathogenesis.
Hydrocele is the most common clinical manifestation of bancroftian filariasis, an endemic disease in 80 countries. In a prospective study, we evaluated the occurrence of intrascrotal lymphangiectasia, testicular morphology and consistency, and hydrocele recurrence in patients living in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area who underwent hydrocelectomy at the Center for Teaching, Research and Tertiary Referral for Bancroftian Filariasis ( NEPAF ). A total of 1, 186 patients with uni- or bilateral filarial hydrocele ( Group-1 ) and a Comparison Group ( CG ) of 218 patients from the same area who already had undergone hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere were enrolled at NEPAF. The hydrocele recurrence rates in Group-1 and in the Comparison Group were 0. 3% and 19. 3%, respectively ( p<0. 001 ). There was no hydrocele recurrence in patients who underwent complete excision of the hydrocele sac ( Group-2 ). Per surgically leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in the inner or outer surface of the hydrocele sac wall or in surrounding tissue, particularly in the retrotesticular area, in 30. 9% and 46. 3% of patients in Group-1 and Group-2, respectively ( p = 0. 081 ). The testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 203/1, 186 ( 18% ) and 10/28 ( 35. 7% ) of patients from Group-1 and Group-2, respectively ( p = 0. 025 ).
Trichinella spiralis is a zoonotic parasitic nematode that causes trichinellosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. During chronic infection, T. spiralis larvae infect skeletal myofibres, severely disrupting their differentiation state. To identify deubiquitinating enzymes ( DUBs ) in T. spiralis, an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, was used to identify DUB activity in lysate of T. spiralis L1 larvae. Immuno-blot and immuno-precipitation analyses identified a number of potential DUBs, including a putative UCH-L5 homologue, TsUCH37. The predicted gene encoding TsUCH37 was cloned and recombinant protein was expressed and purified. The deubiquitinating activity of this enzyme was verified by Ub-AMC assay. Co-precipitation of recombinant TsUCH37 showed that the protein associates with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including the yeast Rpn13 homologue ADRM1. Furthermore, the UCH inhibitor LDN-57444 exhibited specific inhibition of recombinant TsUCH37 and reduced the viability of cultured L1 larvae. This study reports the identification of the first T. spiralis DUB, a cysteine protease that is putatively orthologous to the human protein, hUCH-L5.
Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and is a major public health problem in the Americas. Cysteine protease cruzipain is considered a validated target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of Chagas disease. In this study, we investigated the anti-trypanosomal activity of non-peptidic nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors against the CL Brener strain of T. cruzi. Three nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors based on two scaffolds known to be associated with cathepsin K inhibition showed anti-trypanosomal activity in the 0. 1 μM to 1 μM range. The two most potent compounds had EC50 values of 0. 12 μM and 0. 25 μM, which were an order of magnitude lower than the corresponding Ki values measured against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzipain, in an enzyme inhibition assay. This suggests that the anti-trypanosomal activity of these compounds may not be explained solely by the inhibition of cruzain, thereby triggering a putative polypharmacological profile towards cysteine proteases. In addition, we observed that the anti-trypanosomal activity of two cathepsin K inhibitors based on a cyclohexane dicarboxamide scaffold was significantly greater than what would be expected on the basis of their cruzain inhibitory activity.
Maize ( Zea mays L. ) is one of the most important cereal crops and a model for the study of genetics, evolution, and domestication. To better understand maize genome organization, we constructed a sequence-ready fingerprinted contig-based physical map that covers 93. 5% of the genome, of which 86. 1% is aligned to the genetic map. The fingerprinted contig map contains 25, 908 genic markers that enabled us to align nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. The distribution pattern of expressed sequence tags correlates to that of recombination. In collinear regions, 1 kb in rice corresponds to an average of 3. 2 kb in maize, yet maize has a 6-fold genome size expansion. This can be explained by the fact that most rice regions correspond to two regions in maize as a result of its recent polyploid origin. Inversions account for the majority of chromosome structural variations during subsequent maize diploidization. We also find clear evidence of ancient genome duplication predating the divergence of the progenitors of maize and rice. Reconstructing the paleoethnobotany of the maize genome indicates that the progenitors of modern maize contained ten chromosomes.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies ( TSEs ) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases caused by prions, infectious agents composed of a misfolded version of the prion protein ( PrPSc ) that replicates in the absence of nucleic acids by inducing the misfolding of the cellular prion protein ( PrPC ). The most common form of human prion disease is sporadic, which appears to originate from a low frequency event of spontaneous misfolding to generate the first PrPSc particle that then propagates as in the infectious form of the disease. In this study, we attempted to mimic an early event in the etiology of sporadic disease by attempting de novo generation of infectious PrPSc in vitro using the protein misfolding cyclic amplification ( PMCA ) procedure. Under standard PMCA conditions, de novo generation of PrPSc was never observed, supporting the use of the technology for diagnostic applications. However, we report that PMCA can be modified to generate PrPSc in the absence of pre-existing PrPSc in different animal species at a low and variable rate. The de novo generated PrPSc was infectious when inoculated into wild type hamsters, producing a new disease phenotype with unique clinical, neuropathological and biochemical features.
We present a novel neurally based model for estimating angular velocity ( AV ) in the bee brain. The Angular Velocity Detector Unit ( AVDU ) is capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unaccounted for manipulations of behaviour. The model is fitted using electrophysiological data and tested using behavioural data. We suggest that the AV response can be considered as an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response. The detector is tested behaviourally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings ( square wave or sinusoidal ) on the walls. When combined with an existing flight control algorithm, the detector reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behaviour as found in the real bee’s behaviour. In addition, the summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer.
Sleeping sickness, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, has long been considered invariably fatal if left untreated. However, we report on a 15-year follow-up study of 50 untreated patients from the Ivory Coast, among whom 11 continued to refuse treatment after diagnosis. Using highly specific and sensitive diagnostic tools, we observed parasite clearance in 10 of the 11 patients who continued to refuse treatment, as well as a decrease in serological responses to trypanosome antigens in 7 of the 10 patients. We also observed two alternative natural progressions of the disease: an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses, and an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection associated with a progressive drop in antibody titres, similar to that observed in treated cases. These findings demonstrate that trypanotolerance exists in humans, as it does in animals.
In this study, we investigated the role of irradiation in selecting for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors in vivo. We used mouse models to determine whether ionizing irradiation selects for p53-deficient cells in the hematopoietic system. We found that p53 disruption does not provide a clear selective advantage within an unstressed hematopoietic system or in previously irradiated bone marrow allowed to recover from irradiation. However, upon irradiation, p53 disruption confers a dramatic selective advantage, leading to long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. This selection for cells with disrupted p53 appears to be attributable to several factors, including protection from acute irradiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradiation-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor cells, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and the disabling/elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors. Our results indicate that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing irradiation can in part be explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, which protects progenitor cells both from immediate elimination and from long-term reductions in fitness following irradiation.
Schistosoma mansoni SmKI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor that plays a key role in the parasite's development and survival in its human host. SmKI-1 has been shown to inhibit neutrophil elastase ( NE ) and trypsin in vitro, and molecular docking studies suggest that the Kunitz domain of SmKI-1 binds to the active site of NE. This interaction impairs the ability of NE to kill schistosomula, the larval stage of S. mansoni. In addition, SmKI-1 has anti-inflammatory properties and has been shown to reduce neutrophil recruitment and elastase activity in different murine models of inflammatory diseases, including acetaminophen-mediated liver damage and gout arthritis. Furthermore, SmKI-1 has been shown to inhibit early events that trigger neutrophil recruitment in pleural cavities of mice in response to carrageenan. These results suggest that SmKI-1 is a key protein in S. mansoni survival and has the ability to inhibit neutrophil function as a potential therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases.
Eukaryotic transmembrane helical ( TMH ) proteins perform a wide variety of critical cellular functions, but their high-resolution structure prediction is currently hindered by the lack of close structural homologues. To address this problem, we present a novel and generic method for accurately modeling large TMH protein structures from distant homologues exhibiting distinct loop and TMH conformations. The method was stringently validated in two blind predictions and in a large benchmark consisting of pairs of membrane protein homologues with wide diversity in length, topology, and sequence identity. The method was able to improve most starting templates in the benchmark to reach near-atomic accuracy prediction in the TMH regions. The method was tested in two challenging blind predictions of membrane receptor structures, i. e. GPCR-DOCK 2008 for the adenosine receptor ( A2AR ) and GPCR-DOCK 2010 for the chemokine receptor ( CXCR4 ). The method should prove useful for the atom-level modeling and design of a large fraction of structurally uncharacterized TMH proteins from a wide range of structural homologues. The method should also be useful for rebuilding and refining X-ray structures of membrane receptors where functionally important loop regions have missing densities or are often deleted to facilitate crystallization.
Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses serious risks to fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised adults. During infection, L. monocytogenes proliferates in the host cytosol and exploits the host actin polymerization machinery to spread from cell-to-cell and disseminate in the host. However, we report that during prolonged infection in human hepatocytes or trophoblast cells, L. monocytogenes switches from this active motile lifestyle to a stage of persistence in vacuoles. Upon intercellular spread, bacteria gradually stop producing the actin-nucleating protein ActA and become trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles termed Listeria-Containing Vacuoles ( LisCVs ). Subpopulations of bacteria resist degradation in LisCVs and enter a slow/non-replicative state. During the subculture of host cells harboring LisCVs, bacteria show a capacity to cycle between the vacuolar and the actin-based motility stages. When ActA is absent, such as in ΔactA mutants, vacuolar bacteria parasitize host cells in the so-called “viable but non-culturable” state ( VBNC ), preventing their detection by conventional colony counting methods.
Perceptual alternations between integrated and segregated percepts are a hallmark of auditory bistability in the ABA-triplet paradigm. In this study, we develop a neuromechanistic model of auditory streaming that accurately reproduces the dynamics of these alternations after the build up phase. Our model is motivated by physiological studies of auditory streaming and general models of perceptual bistability. It explicitly incorporates sound-evoked A1 responses as input to a competition network, where perceptual states are identified in the neuronal dynamics rather than pre-assigned to phenomenological units. The inclusion of NMDA-like synaptic dynamics enables temporal binding from one triplet to the next to deal with gaps in the periodic sound input. We predict that manipulations of the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept. We confirm this prediction with psychoacoustic experiments and use the behavioral data to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. Our model provides a platform that can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition. The model parameters controlling the balance between adaptation and noise were tuned to match the statistics of perceptual durations in terms of mean durations and coefficient of variation, and A1 responses were interpreted in a statistical model using neurometric functions that mimic the time course of build up.
Schistosoma mansoni is a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis, a major public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions. Parasite-specific IgE is thought to correlate with protection against S. mansoni infection or re-infection. However, only a few molecular targets of the IgE response in S. mansoni infection have been characterised. To gain a better understanding of the basic mechanisms of anti-parasite immunity, a genome-wide characterisation of S. mansoni allergens is needed. This could lead to a better understanding of allergy and the development of safe and efficacious vaccinations against helminthic parasites. Here, we describe a complete medium- to high-throughput amenable workflow that enables the rapid translation of S. mansoni proteins using wheat germ lysate and subsequent assessment of potential allergenicity with a humanised Rat Basophilic Leukemia ( RBL ) reporter cell line. This method offers an accessible way for assessment of potential allergenicity of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates and is suitable for medium- to high-throughput studies using infected individual sera. We demonstrate the suitability of this system for characterization of novel S. mansoni allergens using well characterised plant and parasitic allergens such as Par j 2, SmTAL-1 and the IgE binding factor IPSE/alpha-1, expressed in wheat germ lysates and/or E. coli.
Hybrid dysgenic syndromes are a form of genomic incompatibility that can arise when the abundance of transposable elements ( TEs ) differs between two parents. When TEs inherited from the father are absent in the mother's genome, TEs can become activated in the progeny, causing germline damage and sterility. In Drosophila, dysgenesis can occur when TEs inherited paternally are not matched with a pool of corresponding TE silencing PIWI-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs ) provisioned by the female germline. Using the D. virilis syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis as a model, we show that divergence in the TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline TE expression when comparing genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses. These differences are transmitted to the next generation and coincide with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. We further demonstrate that gene expression is idiosyncratically influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents that arise through polymorphic TE insertions. Overall, these results support a model in which early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of both TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation.
Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome ( FXTAS ) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5′UTR of the fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) gene, FMR1. The expanded CGG repeat is thought to induce toxicity as RNA, and in FXTAS patients, mRNA levels for FMR1 are markedly increased. Here, we show that overexpressing any of three histone deacetylases ( HDACs 3, 6, or 11 ) suppresses CGG repeat–induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. This suppression results from selective transcriptional repression of the CGG repeat–containing transgene. We also show that in patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, there is increased acetylation of histones at the FMR1 locus in pre-mutation carriers compared to control or FXS derived cell lines. These epigenetic changes correlate with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation cell lines. Moreover, histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) inhibitors repress FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extend lifespan in CGG repeat–expressing Drosophila. These findings support a disease model whereby the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling in cis, which in turn increases expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA.
Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus ( LCMV ) is a chronic viral infection that is controlled by CD8 T cell responses. However, CD8 T cell exhaustion can lead to viral persistence and immunopathology. In this study, we examined the role of host genetics in controlling CD8 T cell function and lethal immunopathology during chronic LCMV Cl-13 infection. We used F1 crosses of B10. D2 x B6 ( D2B6F1 ) and BALB. B x BALB/c ( BCF1 ) mice to examine the impact of MHC heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on the development of chronic viral infection. Following chronic Cl-13 infection, both D2B6F1 and BCF1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice. Strikingly, D2B6F1 mice on a C57BL genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection. CD8 T cell depletion prevented mortality in Cl-13-infected D2B6F1 mice, indicating that mortality was CD8 T-cell-dependent. D2B6F1 mice maintained more CD8 T cell effector cytokine production and exhibited reduced expression of the T cell exhaustion marker PD-1. In addition, D2B6F1 mice induced a larger Th1 response than BCF1 mice and Cl-13-induced mortality in D2B6F1 mice was also dependent on CD4 T-cell-mediated IFN-γ production.
Anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is an important zoonotic disease in China, especially in rural regions. In this study, we analyzed the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. We used canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism ( canSNP ) analysis and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis ( MLVA ) with 15 markers to analyze 106 B. anthracis strains collected from six provinces in northwestern China. We identified five sublineages/subgroups, namely, A. Br. 001/002, A. Br. Vollum, A. Br. Aust94, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br. 008/009, using 13 canSNP sites. All of the sublineages were found in Xinjiang province, while one sublineage was found in Shaanxi, two in Gansu, three in Qinghai, and four in Inner Mongolia. However, the geographical distribution of the B. anthracis populations exhibited different canSNP characteristics from those of the strains isolated before 1990 in China. In contrast to previous data, the A. Br. Ames subgroup was also observed to be scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces. By canSNP analysis and MLVA, we found that the diversification of MLVA genotypes and the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations is gradually becoming balanced across northwestern China. This study also provides preliminary survey results regarding the population diversity of B. anthracis in China, which will help promote the prevention and control of this important disease.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and related food and waterborne pathogens cause severe diarrheal disease by infecting the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells ( IECs ) and colonizing the intestinal luminal surface. To defend against these pathogens, hosts rely on immune-mediated changes in IECs, including goblet cells, which produce the mucin Muc2 and the goblet cell-derived mediator, Resistin-like Molecule ( RELM ) -β. RELM-β is strongly induced within goblet cells during infection with Citrobacter rodentium, a related mouse pathogen, and is detected in the stool and serum. Despite its dramatic induction, the role of RELM-β in host defense was unclear. Here, we show that RELM-β acts as a CD4+ T cell chemoattractant to recruit CD4+ T cells to the infected colon, where they drive a protective increase in IEC proliferation through the production of interleukin ( IL ) -22. Mice lacking the RELM-β gene ( Retnlb-/- ) suffered increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to deep pathogen penetration of colonic crypts, and were impaired in infection-induced IEC hyper-proliferation. Enema delivery of RELM-β to Retnlb-/- mice restored CD4+ T cell recruitment, concurrently increasing IL-22 levels and IEC proliferation, while reducing mucosal pathology. These findings demonstrate that RELM-β and goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4+ T cells to the colon to protect against enteric pathogens.
Noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, have an unusual mechanism to initiate protein synthesis that relies on interactions between the VPg protein attached to the 5´-end of the viral RNA and eukaryotic initiation factors ( eIFs ) in the host cell. We have identified a conserved ~20 amino acid motif in the C terminus of norovirus VPg proteins that mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT-1 domain within the 4GM fragment of eIF4G. This motif is conserved in all known noroviruses and binds to eIF4G HEAT-1 with micromolar affinity. Our results show that norovirus VPg serves as a proteinaceous ‘5´-cap’ that does not require a functional interaction with the cap-binding protein, eIF4E. We have used a combination of pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ), and NMR spectroscopy to define the VPg binding site on eIF4G HEAT-1, which is non-overlapping with the binding site for eIF4A on eIF4G HEAT-1. We have also shown that norovirus VPg can form ternary VPg-eIF4G-eIF4A complexes. The functional significance of the VPg-eIF4G interaction was demonstrated by the ability of fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VPg to inhibit in vitro translation of norovirus RNA but not cap- or IRES-dependent translation.
The evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes has been a topic of interest in the field of evolutionary biology. Genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are often found near each other along bacterial chromosomes. Several explanations have been proposed to account for the evolution of these structures, including natural selection, the selfish operon model, and the persistence model. Here, we develop computational models to study the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve and persist. We examine the selfish operon model by re-implementing the simulation and running it under a wide range of conditions. We also introduce and study a Moran process in which there is natural selection for gene clustering and rearrangement occurs by genome inversion events. Finally, we develop and study a model that includes selection and inversion, which tracks the occurrence and fixation of rearrangements. Surprisingly, gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions. However, factors that promote the evolution of gene clusters include a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and in the case of the selfish operon model, a high horizontal transfer rate. The selfish operon model is still viable as an explanation for the evolution of gene clusters under these conditions.
Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is responsible for significant morbidity, mortality, and economic losses in tropical regions. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of the infection due to the specific adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a unique variant of PfEMP1, called VAR2CSA, which binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placentas. VAR2CSA is only expressed in the presence of a placenta, suggesting that its expression is actively repressed in men, children, or non-pregnant women. However, the mechanism of repression is not understood. We show that the gene encoding VAR2CSA contains a small upstream open reading frame ( uORF ) that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA, revealing a novel form of gene regulation in malaria parasites. The mechanism underlying this translational repression is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation upon selection, thus potentially enabling parasites to upregulate expression of this variant antigen in the presence of the appropriate host tissue.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection leads to a spectrum of disease outcomes, ranging from asymptomatic infection to hemorrhagic fever and shock. The pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations of DENV infection may be driven by host responses, which could be reflected in the transcriptional profiles of peripheral blood immune cells. We conducted genome-wide microarray analysis of whole blood RNA from 34 DENV-infected children in Nicaragua collected on days 3–6 of illness, with different disease manifestations. Gene expression analysis identified genes that are differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between dengue patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein biosynthesis. In the dengue hemorrhagic fever patients, one subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. A meta-analysis of our dataset in conjunction with previously published datasets confirmed that DENV infection in vivo is associated with large changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Notably, whereas in vitro infection leads to an increased interferon signature, this was not consistently observed from in vivo patient samples, suggesting that the interferon response in vivo is relatively transient and was no longer observed by days 3–6 of illness.
Herpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause much disease and are difficult to clear from the host. To understand how herpesviruses enter the host, we need to know how they cross differentiated mucus-covered epithelia in vivo. We studied the host entry of Murid Herpesvirus-4 ( MuHV-4 ), a lymphotropic rhadinovirus related to the Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus. We found that MuHV-4 targets the olfactory neuroepithelium for host entry. Like many herpesviruses, MuHV-4 binds to heparan sulfate ( HS ), and virions unable to bind HS show poor host entry. The olfactory neuroepithelium expresses HS on its apical neuronal cilia and is bound strongly by incoming virions. Incoming virions track down the neuronal cilia and either infect neurons or reach the underlying microvilli of the adjacent glial ( sustentacular ) cells and infect them. Thus, the olfactory neuroepithelium provides an important and complex site of HS-dependent herpesvirus uptake. MuHV-4 exploits neurons for host entry even though it is not classically neurotropic, suggesting that the olfactory neuroepithelium may provide many herpesviruses with an important entry portal.
Salmonella enterica invasion of epithelial cells requires the expression of genes located in the pathogenicity island I ( SPI-1 ). The expression of SPI-1 genes is tightly regulated and activated only under specific conditions. Here, we describe a new regulatory circuit involving CRP-cAMP, a widely established metabolic regulator, in silencing of SPI-1 genes under non-permissive conditions. CRP-cAMP-deficient Salmonella strains are unable to secrete SPI-1 T3SS effector proteins and are avirulent in a mouse model, suggesting a role for CRP-cAMP in the regulation of Salmonella virulence. CRP-cAMP indirectly regulates virulence by affecting the post-transcriptional regulation of hilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion. CRP-cAMP modulates the level of hilD at the post-transcriptional level and requires the presence of a newly identified regulatory motif within the hilD 3’UTR. We further demonstrate that the Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot 42 is under the transcriptional repression of CRP-cAMP and, when this repression is relieved, Spot 42 exerts a positive effect on hilD expression. In vivo and in vitro assays indicate that Spot 42 targets the 3’UTR of the hilD transcript. Together, our results highlight the biological relevance of the hilD 3’UTR as a hub for post-transcriptional control of Salmonella invasion gene expression.
Huntington's disease ( HD ) and myotonic dystrophy 1 are caused by the expansion of CAG/CTG repeats. These expansions are unstable in selective somatic tissues, which accelerates disease progression. We investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus in the R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene, albeit integrated at a different site, and recapitulate HD tissue-specific instability. We show that instability rates are increased in R6/2 tissues as compared to R6/1 matched-samples. High transgene expression levels and chromatin accessibility correlated with the increased CAG instability of R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation at the HD locus were increased, whereas H3K9 dimethylation was reduced in R6/2 tissues relative to R6/1 matched-tissues. However, the levels of transgene expression and these specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing very different CAG instability levels. Interestingly, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at the HD locus, but not the initiating form of RNA Pol II, were tissue-specific and correlated with CAG instability levels. Similarly, H3K36 trimethylation, a mark associated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum.
Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) is one of the most virulent enteroviruses, but the specific molecular features that enhance its ability to disseminate in humans remain unknown. We analyzed the genomic features of EV71 in an immunocompromised host with disseminated disease and identified three nucleotide changes that occurred within a five-day period: a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 located within the BC loop ( L97R ), a conservative amino acid substitution in protein 2B ( A38V ), and a silent mutation in protein 3D ( L175 ). Infectious clones were constructed using both BrCr ( lineage A ) and the clinical strain ( lineage C ) backgrounds containing either one or both non-synonymous mutations. In vitro cell tropism and competition assays revealed that the VP197 Leu to Arg substitution within the BC loop conferred a replicative advantage in SH-SY5Y cells of neuroblastoma origin. Interestingly, this mutation was frequently associated in vitro with a second non-conservative mutation ( E167G or E167A ) in the VP1 EF loop in neuroblastoma cells. Comparative models of these EV71 VP1 variants were built to determine how the substitutions might affect VP1 structure and/or interactions with host cells. Our results show that the VP1 BC loop region of EV71 plays a critical role in cell tropism independent of EV71 lineage and may have contributed to dissemination and neurotropism in the immunocompromised patient.
Streptococcus species are able to acquire new traits, such as antibiotic resistance, through the process of natural transformation, or competence. This process is regulated by quorum sensing ( QS ) mediated by peptide pheromones. One such system, ComRS, consists of a peptide ( ComS ) that is processed, secreted, and later imported into the cytoplasm, where it binds and activates the transcription factor ComR. ComR then engages in a positive feedback loop for the expression of ComS and the alternative sigma-factor SigX. Although ComRS are present in the majority of Streptococcus species, the sequence of both ComS/XIP and ComR diverge significantly, suggesting a mechanism for species-specific communication. We developed a ‘test-bed’ assay to measure the activity of different ComR proteins in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides in vivo, revealing distinct ComR classes of strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity among species. We then solved an X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S. suis to further understand the interaction with XIP and to search for structural features in ComR proteins that may explain XIP recognition. Our results provide a model for XIP recognition and specificity, and allow for the prediction of novel XIP peptides that induce ComR activity.
Eukaryotic centromeres are epigenetically maintained at specific chromosomal sites over many generations. In this study, we used the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans as a model organism to study the DNA replication properties of centromeric DNA. We discovered that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome, and that epigenetic formation of new ectopic centromeres ( neocentromeres ) is accompanied by shifts in replication timing, such that a neocentromere becomes the first to replicate and is associated with origin recognition complex ( ORC ) components. Furthermore, changing the level of the centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions, further supporting the idea that centromere proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. This pattern is conserved, together with centromere position, among related strains and species, in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence. Thus, inheritance of centromere position is correlated with a constitutively active origin of replication that fires at a distinct early time.
Chronic back pain ( CBP ) is the leading cause of years lived with disability worldwide, yet little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying this symptom. We conducted a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) meta-analysis of 158, 025 adults of European ancestry from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology ( CHARGE ) consortium and the UK Biobank. CBP cases were defined as those reporting back pain present for ≥3–6 months; non-cases were included as controls. We found a genome-wide significant association for the intronic variant rs12310519 in SOX5 ( OR 1. 08, p = 7. 2×10−10 ), which was subsequently replicated in 283, 752 UK Biobank participants not included in the discovery sample ( OR 1. 06, p = 5. 3×10−11 ), and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis ( OR 1. 07, p = 4. 5×10−19 ). We also found suggestive associations at three other loci in the discovery sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide significance in joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant, rs7833174, located between CCDC26 and GSDMC ( OR 1. 05, p = 4. 4×10−13 ), and an intronic variant, rs4384683, in DCC ( OR 0. 97, p = 2. 4×10−10 ).
Taenia solium cysticercosis is a neglected zoonotic disease that affects both humans and pigs in many developing countries. It is an important cause of epilepsy in regions where the parasite occurs, but it is largely underreported and there is a lack of data about the disease burden. This study aimed to calculate the impact of T. solium cysticercosis in Cameroon by applying both cost and Disability Adjusted Life Year ( DALY ) estimations. Based on a prevalence of epilepsy of 3. 6%, the number of people with neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy was estimated at 50, 326 ( 95% CR 37, 299–65, 924 ), representing 1. 0% of the local population. The number of pigs diagnosed with cysticercosis was estimated at 15, 961 ( 95% CR 12, 320–20, 044 ), which corresponds to 5. 6% of the local pig population. The total annual costs due to T. solium cysticercosis in West Cameroon were estimated at 10, 255, 202 Euro ( 95% CR 6, 889, 048–14, 754, 044 ), of which 4. 7% were due to losses in pig husbandry and 95. 3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The monetary burden per case of cysticercosis amounts to 194 Euro ( 95% CR 147–253 ). The average number of DALYs lost was 9. 0 per thousand persons per year ( 95% CR 2. 8–20. 4 ).
Staphylococcus aureus produces a large number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) for which the functions are poorly understood. We demonstrate that the Sigma B-dependent ncRNA RsaA represses the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator MgrA by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine and Dalgarno sequence and a loop-loop interaction within the coding region of the target mRNA. These two recognition sites are required for translation repression. Consequently, RsaA causes enhanced production of biofilm and a decreased synthesis of capsule formation in several strain backgrounds. These phenotypes led to a decreased protection of S. aureus against opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes compared to the mutant strains lacking RsaA. Mice animal models showed that RsaA attenuates the severity of acute systemic infections and enhances chronic catheter infection. RsaA takes part in a regulatory network that contributes to the complex interactions of S. aureus with the host immune system to moderate invasiveness and favour chronic infections. It is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. We propose that RsaA has been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions with the host.
HIV-1 uncoating is a critical step in establishing a life-long infection, yet it is poorly understood. Here, we report a novel strategy to visualize HIV-1 uncoating using a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of a capsid-binding host protein, cyclophilin A ( CypA-DsRed ). CypA-DsRed is specifically packaged into virions through high-avidity binding to the HIV-1 capsid ( CA ). Single virus imaging reveals that CypA-DsRed remains associated with cores after permeabilization/removal of the viral membrane and is lost concomitantly with CA in vitro and in living cells. The rate of loss is modulated by core stability and is accelerated upon initiation of reverse transcription. We show that the majority of single cores lose CypA-DsRed shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Single particle tracking at late times post-infection reveals a gradual loss of CypA-DsRed dependent on reverse transcription. Uncoating occurs both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. Our novel imaging assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 uncoating in living cells and reveals the previously unappreciated spatio-temporal features of this process.
Oligonucleotide usage in prokaryotic genomes can be linked to a number of properties, including codon usage, DNA base-stacking energy, and DNA structural conformation. We investigated how oligonucleotide frequencies differ in coding and non-coding regions, and how DNA sequence patterns change within and between prokaryotic organisms. Our results show that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that prokaryotic DNA is predominantly short range correlated, i. e., information in prokaryotic genomes is encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. We found that bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were found to be approximately 5. 5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes. GC-rich genomes were more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes.
Meiotic recombination is a process that ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity through both large-scale reciprocal crossovers and very localised gene conversion events, also known as noncrossovers. While considerable progress has been made in understanding factors such as PRDM9 and SNP variants that influence the initiation of recombination at human hotspots, very little is known about factors acting downstream. To address this, we simultaneously analysed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm DNA at six highly active hotspots, and looked for disparity in the transmission of allelic variants indicative of any cis-acting influences. We identified a novel form of biased transmission that was exclusive to the noncrossover class of recombinant, and which presumably arises through differences between crossovers and noncrossovers in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair. This form of biased gene conversion is not predicted to influence hotspot activity as previously noted for SNPs that affect recombination initiation, but does constitute a powerful and previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive that by extrapolation may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome.
Human health can be negatively affected by exposure to environmental chemicals and drugs. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of such compounds is needed to determine the risk. We present a high confidence human protein-protein association network built upon the integration of chemical toxicology and systems biology. This computational systems chemical biology model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, thus predicting which compounds may be risk factors for human health. The network can also be used to identify unexpected potential associations between chemicals and proteins. We propose an approach that integrates toxicogenomics data, chemical structures, protein-protein interaction data, disease information, and functional annotation to associate chemicals to disease and identify potential molecular targets. We downloaded the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database ( CTD ), which contains curated information combining drug and environmental chemical data associated with proteins. We selected 42, 194 associations between 2, 490 unique compounds and 6, 060 molecular targets known to be involved in human disease. We then analyzed selected clusters to identify new chemical-disease associations.
Auditory cortical neurons in the primary auditory cortex can be characterized by their spectrotemporal receptive fields ( STRFs ), which describe the spectral and temporal features of a sound that linearly drive a neuron. However, this characterization does not capture the complex nonlinear network in which the neuron is embedded. By fitting a nonlinear feedforward network model, called a network receptive field ( NRF ), to cortical responses to natural sounds, we reveal that primary auditory cortical neurons are sensitive over a substantially larger spectrotemporal domain than is seen in their standard STRFs. The NRF is a parsimonious network consisting of 1–7 sub-receptive fields that interact nonlinearly, and consistently better predicts neural responses to auditory stimuli than the standard STRFs. The NRF reveals separate excitatory and inhibitory sub-fields with different nonlinear properties, and interaction of the sub-fields gives rise to important operations such as gain control and conjunctive feature detection. The conjunctive effects, where neurons respond only if several specific features are present together, enable increased selectivity for particular complex spectrotemporal structures, and may constitute an important stage in sound recognition. We demonstrate that fitting auditory cortical neural responses with feedforward network models expands on simple linear receptive field models in a manner that yields substantially improved predictive power and reveals key nonlinear aspects of cortical processing.
The mammalian circadian clock is composed of clock genes that act in transcription-translation feedback loops to drive global rhythmic expression of the transcriptome and allow an organism to anticipate the momentum of the day. Using a novel clock-perturbing peptide, we established a pivotal role for casein kinase 2 ( CK2 ) -mediated circadian BMAL1-Ser90 phosphorylation ( BMAL1-P ) in regulating central and peripheral core clocks. Subsequent analysis of the underlying mechanism revealed a novel role of CRY as a repressor of CK2 protein kinase activity toward BMAL1-S90. CRY proteins have a dual function: in addition to their known role as repressors of BMAL1–CLOCK-driven transcription, we found a novel role of CRY proteins as a repressor of CK2 protein kinase activity toward BMAL1-S90. We propose a dual negative-feedback model in which a CRY-dependent CK2-driven posttranslational BMAL1–P-BMAL1 loop is an integral part of the core clock oscillator. The BMAL1 protein is hyperphosphorylated in CRY1/2-deficient mice, leading us to hypothesize that CRY proteins are involved in rhythmic BMAL1 modification. We established a circadian clock-controlling role of CK2 kinase, formerly thought to be a constitutively active kinase, in BMAL1 phosphorylation and uncovered a novel role of CRY as a regulator of cyclic CK2-mediated BMAL1 phosphorylation.
Salmonella enterica, a pathogenic bacterium, is able to survive in the presence of bile by employing multiple mechanisms of adaptation. We show that sublethal concentrations of the bile salt sodium deoxycholate ( DOC ) can adapt Salmonella to survive lethal concentrations of bile. This adaptation is associated with multiple changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of the RpoS-dependent general stress response and other stress responses. The general stress response plays a crucial role in adaptation to bile, as RpoS− mutants are unable to survive in the presence of lethal concentrations of bile. In addition to adaptation by gene expression, individual Salmonella cells can become bile-resistant without previous adaptation, and such cells are present in non-adapted cultures at frequencies between 10−6 and 10−7 per cell and generation. Fluctuation analysis indicates that these cells are present in the previous culture, and full genome sequencing of bile-resistant mutants shows that alteration of the lipopolysaccharide transport machinery is a frequent cause of mutational bile resistance. However, selection on lethal concentrations of bile also provides bile-resistant isolates that are not mutants, and we propose that such isolates derive from rare cells whose physiological state permitted survival upon encountering bile.
The E. coli chromosome is organized into 400–500 supercoiled domains by both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. We find that prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by the proximal location of Mu termini L and R, which are 37 kbp apart on the Mu genome. The formation/maintenance of the Mu ‘domain’ configuration is dependent on a strong gyrase site ( SGS ) at the center of Mu, the Mu L end and MuB protein, and the E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis and HU. The Mu domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations tested. By contrast, prophage λ does not form an independent domain. The establishment/maintenance of the Mu domain was promoted by low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which was domain dependent. We propose that the domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by fostering topological requirements of the reaction and the proximity of Mu ends. The potential benefits to the host cell from a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage may in turn help its long-term stability.
Plasmodium vivax ( Pv ) and Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) gametocyte carriage was studied in school-aged Papua New Guinean children who received radical cure treatment with chloroquine, artemether-lumefantrine plus either primaquine ( PQ ) or placebo. PQ is the only licensed antimalarial that prevents Pv relapses and clears mature Pf gametocytes. PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, which was comparable to its effect on incidence of blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79% of Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis revealed that the odds of gametocytes were significantly reduced in mixed-species infections compared to single-species infections for both species. No difference between the PQ and placebo treatment arms was observed in density of Pv gametocytes or in the proportion of Pv infections that carried gametocytes. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment were equally likely to carry gametocytes than first infections after PQ treatment. Pv relapses and new infections were associated with similar levels of gametocytaemia. Relapses thus contribute considerably to the Pv reservoir, highlighting the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv.
Rho GTPases are a family of proteins that control actin organization during various cellular processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. Although the primary members of this family ( RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42 ) have different downstream effects on actin remodeling, they share a common mechanism involving targeting to the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. We hypothesized that the details of GTPase cycling between the membrane and cytosol are key to the differential upstream regulation of these biochemical switches. We developed a modeling framework to analyze experimental data for these systems, which can reveal details of GDI-mediated cycling and help distinguish between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and direct association-dissociation of GTPase with membrane molecules. Our analysis of experimental data for Rac membrane cycling reveals that the lower apparent affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be fully explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. We present non-dimensional steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTPase in multidimensional charts, which can be used to illustrate the effects of GEFs/GAPs and regulated affinities between GTPases and membrane and/or GDI on the amount of membrane bound GTPase.
Schistosomiasis is a major public health problem for which the World Health Organization ( WHO ) aims to achieve morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem. Monitoring and evaluation ( M&E ) programmes are used to collect data to assess the impact of current interventions on schistosomiasis control. Typically, prevalence and intensity of infection data are collected from school-aged children ( SAC ) as they are relatively easy to sample and are thought to be most likely to be infected by schistosome parasites. However, adults are also likely to be infected. We investigated how the age distribution of infection impacts the mathematical model generated recommendations of the preventive chemotherapy coverage levels required to achieve the WHO goals for Schistosoma mansoni. We used three different age-intensity profiles of infection with low, moderate and high burdens of infection in adults. Our results show that for moderate prevalence regions, treating SAC only may achieve the WHO goals. However, for high prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is required to meet the WHO goals. We highlight the importance of collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age-range, specifically the inclusion of adult data at baseline and throughout the treatment programme, to accurately determine the treatment strategy for a defined region.
Temporal lobe epilepsy ( TLE ) is a common neurological disorder characterised by disruptive seizures. In drug resistant cases, resective surgery is often considered. However, this procedure is hampered by unpredictable success rates, with many patients continuing to have seizures even after surgery. In this study, we apply a computational model of epilepsy to patient specific structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) of 22 individuals with left TLE and 39 healthy controls. We validate the model by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset time and network location. We then investigate the potential of the model for surgery prediction by performing in silico surgical resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing seizure likelihood post-surgery to pre-surgery simulations. We find that patients tend to transit from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls in the model. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly within temporal and subcortical regions, are the most frequent starting points for seizures in patients in the model. Our analysis also implicates regions in the contralateral and frontal locations which may play a role in seizure spreading or surgery resistance. Finally, the model predicts that patient-specific surgery may lead to better outcomes than the currently used routine clinical procedure.
Human herpesvirus 8 ( HHV-8 ) encodes four viral interferon regulatory factors ( vIRFs 1–4 ), which interfere with the host's innate antiviral defenses by blocking interferon and apoptotic signaling. Here, we report that vIRF-1 directly targets and inactivates Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, via nuclear translocation. Bim is a key negative regulator of HHV-8 replication. vIRF-1-mediated relocalization of Bim was detected in transfected cells and in lytically infected endothelial cells. In vitro co-precipitation assays revealed a direct interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim, and Bim-binding residues of vIRF-1 were mapped by deletion and point mutagenesis. Generation of Bim-refractory vIRF-1 variants revealed the importance of vIRF-1:Bim interaction in vIRF-1's pro-replication and anti-apoptotic activity. Blocking the interaction with a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the Bim-binding region of vIRF-1 confirmed the relevance of vIRF-1:Bim association to vIRF-1's pro-replication activity. This is the first report of an IRF protein that interacts with a Bcl-2 family member and of nuclear sequestration of Bim or any other member of the family as a means of inactivation.
The epithelial integrin αVβ6 plays a crucial role in regulating the amplitude of protective lung interferon ( IFN ) responses against multiple respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus, Sendai virus, and bacterial pneumonia. Mice lacking the β6 integrin ( β6 KO ) are protected from disease caused by influenza infection and develop less severe acute lung injury ( ALI ), characterized by reduced edema, inflammatory cytokine expression, and vascular permeability of the lung epithelium. β6 KO mice also have altered baseline homeostasis with high baseline CD11b+ CD11c+ macrophages. We show that the protection of β6 KO mice from influenza infection depends on the loss of β6-activated transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) and elevated type I IFN signaling, while the phenotypic changes in lung macrophages are independent of the type I IFN pathway. Macrophages isolated from TGF-β1-treated β6 KO mice display decreased mRNA encoding levels of IFN-associated transcripts, highlighting that the loss of β6-activated TGF-β results in an altered lung macrophage population and increased type I IFN activation. Furthermore, β6 KO mice treated with TGF-β1 have increased numbers of CD11c+ CD11b- macrophages and are no longer protected from influenza infection, suggesting that the loss of β6-mediated TGF-β1 activation is important for both protection and the ‘activated’ macrophage phenotype.
Leishmania ( Viannia ) braziliensis is the most common cause of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis in the Americas. Diagnosis of this disease is challenging due to the low parasite burden in lesions. The Leishmanin Skin Test ( LST ) is used as a complementary tool for diagnosis in endemic areas, based on delayed type hypersensitivity responses to Leishmania antigens injected intradermally. We performed a retrospective analysis of 733 cases of tegumentary leishmaniasis evaluated at a reference center in Argentina between 2006 and 2015 to assess the usefulness of LST as a diagnostic tool. We found that 65% of cases were confirmed through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with only 6 cases having a negative LST. Among smear-negative cases, 190 were also negative by LST, but 69 cases had a positive LST. The sensitivity of LST was similar to that of smears across all age groups. We also found that lesions older than 21 days were more likely to have positive results for both smears and LST. These findings support the use of LST as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis across all age groups, even in endemic areas.
Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) have identified over 40 loci that affect CAD risk, but the causal mechanisms at the majority of these loci are unknown. In this study, we used a combination of open chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements ( FAIRE-seq ) and enhancer and transcription factor mapping using chromatin immuno-precipitation ( ChIP-seq ) in primary human macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ), with resultant foam cell formation. We found that oxLDL-induced foam cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and active enhancer sites that strongly correlated with expression changes of nearby genes. OxLDL-regulated enhancers were enriched for several transcription factors, including C/EBP-beta, which has no previously documented role in foam cell formation. We found that variants at CAD-associated loci were significantly and specifically enriched in the subset of chromatin sites altered by oxLDL exposure, including rs72664324 in an oxLDL-induced enhancer at the PPAP2B locus. OxLDL increased C/EBP beta binding to this site and C/EBP beta binding and enhancer activity were stronger with the protective A allele of rs72664324. In addition, expression of the PPAP2B protein product LPP3 was present in foam cells in human atherosclerotic plaques and oxLDL exposure up-regulated LPP3 in macrophages resulting in increased degradation of pro-inflammatory mediators.
One round of azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) may be sufficient to interrupt transmission of trachoma in districts with a prevalence of trachomatous inflammation–follicular (TF) of 5. 0–9. 9% in 1–9-year-olds. In Malawi, eight districts with baseline TF prevalences of 5. 0–9. 9% were treated with one round of azithromycin MDA, achieving a mean coverage of ~80%. We report the results of impact surveys conducted at least 6 months after MDA in 18 evaluation units of the 8 treated districts. Each of the 18 evaluation units had a TF1-9 prevalence <5. 0%. The study demonstrates that one round of azithromycin MDA with ~80% coverage is associated with a reduction in TF prevalence to <5% in Malawi districts with TF of 5. 0–9. 9%. This approach may be a practical alternative to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommendation of three rounds of azithromycin treatment for districts with TF prevalence ≥10%. The study provides optimism that Malawi may be able to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
Plants have evolved a sophisticated innate immune system to defend against pathogen attacks. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat ( NLR ) protein complexes are intracellular immune sensors that recognize pathogen-encoded effectors to initiate complex immune responses, including a sustained increase in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, transcriptional reprogramming, production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), and programmed cell death ( PCD ). In Arabidopsis thaliana, NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1 initiate resistance upon recognition of pathogen effectors AvrRpt2 and AvrRpm1/AvrB, respectively. We identified six closely related Arabidopsis Ca2+-dependent protein kinases ( CPKs ) that mediate bifurcate immune responses activated by NLR proteins. The dynamics of differential CPK1/2 activation by pathogen effectors controls the onset of cell death. Sustained activation of CPK4/5/6/11 phosphorylates a specific subgroup of WRKY transcription factors, WRKY8/28/48, to synergistically regulate transcriptional reprogramming crucial for NLR-dependent restriction of pathogen growth. In contrast, CPK1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane-resident NADPH oxidases for ROS production and contribute to PCD.
Schistosoma haematobium, a neglected tropical disease, imposes a significant burden on public health in developing countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In Mali, the incidence of S. haematobium is rising due to factors such as irrigation and hydro-electric projects, shifts from nomadic to sedentary existence, and ineffective control programs. To enhance management and control of this parasitic infection, public health programs could benefit from parsimonious forecasting and early warning systems. However, less than 0. 5% of Schistosoma sp. investigations have attempted to predict their spatial and temporal distributions. In this study, the S. haematobium time-series for the district of Niono, Mali, was fitted with general-purpose exponential smoothing methods to generate contemporaneous on-line forecasts. These methods, encapsulated within a state–space framework, accommodate seasonal and inter-annual time-series fluctuations. The exponential smoothing state–space framework employed herein produced reasonably accurate forecasts for this time-series, which reflects the incidence of S. haematobium–induced terminal hematuria. The framework obliquely captured prior non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and exogenous covariates, such as climate, irrigation, and public health interventions. Therefore, this framework could assist with managing and assessing S. haematobium transmission and intervention impact in the district of Niono, Mali, and potentially elsewhere in the Sahel.
Human cytomegalovirus ( HCMV ) has evolved an additional level of self-imposed restriction by the viral tegument protein pp150, which prevents the onset of viral gene expression in the S/G2 cell cycle phase of otherwise fully permissive cells. This restriction is mediated by a cyclin A-binding motif in pp150. We investigated the physiological relevance of this restriction during productive HCMV infection by employing a cyclin A-binding deficient pp150 mutant virus. One consequence of unrestricted viral gene expression in S/G2 was the induction of a G2/M arrest. G2-arrested but not mitotic cells supported viral replication. Cyclin A destabilization by the viral gene product pUL21a was required to maintain the virus-permissive G2-arrest. An HCMV double-point mutant where both pp150 and pUL21a are disabled in cyclin A interaction forced mitotic entry of the majority of infected cells, with a severe negative impact on cell viability and virus growth. Thus, pp150 and pUL21a functionally cooperate, together building a cell cycle synchronization strategy of cyclin A targeting and avoidance that is essential for productive HCMV infection.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive degeneration of motor neurons, ultimately leading to paralysis and death. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, with the remaining 90% being sporadic. The cause of ALS in approximately 30% of familial cases and in the majority of sporadic cases remains unknown. We undertook a targeted sequencing approach of 169 known and candidate ALS disease genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 matched controls to try to identify novel variants linked to ALS. We found a significant enrichment in novel and rare variants in cases versus controls, indicating that we are likely identifying disease associated mutations. This study highlights the utility of next generation sequencing techniques combined with functional studies and rare variant analysis tools to provide insight into the genetic etiology of a heterogeneous sporadic disease. We found rare or novel variants in 144 of the 242 patients sequenced, suggesting that at minimum approximately 40% of the cases have no potential genetic cause for ALS that we could identify with our sequencing method and set of candidate genes. We identified new variants in known ALS disease genes, as well as in genes associated with ALS, and found no association between several previously identified SNPs and ALS in our population, with the exception of APOE.
Influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells require interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) for their development and function. IL-6 is an important regulator of T cell proliferation and survival, and it is abundant following infection with influenza virus. In this study, we analyzed the role of IL-6 in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus in wild type and IL-6 deficient mice. We found that CD4+ T cell memory, but not CD8+ T cell memory, is critically dependent on IL-6. IL-6 limits the activity of virus-specific CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells ( Tregs ), thereby facilitating the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells. We demonstrated that influenza-induced IL-6 limits the activity of virus-specific Tregs, thereby facilitating the activity of virus-specific memory CD4+ T cells. In contrast, CD8+ T cell memory is unimpaired in IL-6 deficient mice, suggesting that CD4+ and CD8+ T cells differ in their susceptibility to suppression by Tregs. Our findings support the view that IL-6 has an inhibitory effect on the activity of virus-specific Tregs, thereby favoring pathogen clearance and survival of the host.
Cytosine-5 methyltransferases of the Dnmt2 family are known to function as DNA and tRNA methyltransferases. However, the role and biological significance of Dnmt2 are greatly hampered by a lack of knowledge about its protein interactions. In this report, we identify enolase as a Dnmt2-binding protein through a yeast two-hybrid screen. Enolase, a glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, has both cytoplasmatic and nuclear localization in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. We show that enolase acts as a Dnmt2 inhibitor and that this inhibitory activity is antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls the non-glycolytic function of enolase. Interestingly, glucose starvation drives enolase to accumulate within the nucleus, leading to the formation of additional enolase-E. histolytica DNMT2 homolog ( Ehmeth ) complex, and to a significant reduction of the tRNAAsp methylation in the parasite. We also demonstrate that enolase is the first Dnmt2-interacting protein and highlight an unexpected role of a glycolytic enzyme in the modulation of Dnmt2 activity.
Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) is a mosquito-borne pathogen transmitted to humans via saliva during blood feeding. Mosquito saliva is a complex mixture of secretory factors that modulate the feeding site to enhance pathogen infection and establishment. Here, we report the discovery of exogenous microRNAs ( miRNAs ) in the saliva of two species of Aedes mosquitoes, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are generally found inside cells. However, circulating miRNAs have been identified in human serum and saliva. We used next generation sequencing to identify 103 exogenous miRNAs in mosquito saliva, of which 31 were previously unidentified and designated as novel. Several miRNAs were expressed only in CHIKV-infected mosquitoes. Five saliva miRNAs were tested for their potential to regulate CHIKV infection, and our results demonstrate their functional role in transmission and establishment of infection during blood feeding on the host. Inhibition of these miRNAs decreased viral replication, suggesting that they enhance CHIKV replication and dissemination in the host and at the site of infection.
Mitochondrial DNA ( mtDNA ) is an independently maintained genome that encodes proteins required for cellular respiration. Deletions in the mtDNA are associated with several maternally inherited diseases, certain cancers, and neurological disorders. These deletions are often flanked by short, repetitive sequences, suggesting that they may result from recombination events. Our current understanding of mtDNA maintenance and repair is limited compared to nuclear DNA repair. This study investigated the contribution of nuclear double-strand break repair ( DSBR ) proteins Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p in mtDNA repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have determined that Rad51p and Rad59p are localized to the matrix of the mitochondria and that Rad51p binds directly to mitochondrial DNA. A mitochondrially-targeted restriction endonuclease was used to produce a unique double-strand break ( DSB ) in the mitochondrial genome, allowing direct analysis of DSB repair in vivo. We find that loss of Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p significantly decreases the rate of spontaneous deletion events and the loss of Rad51p and Rad59p impairs the repair of induced mtDNA DSBs.
Acute rheumatic fever ( ARF ) and rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) pose a major disease burden among disadvantaged populations worldwide. These conditions result from Group A Streptococcal ( GAS ) infection and are acknowledged as diseases of poverty. However, the role of specific social and environmental factors in GAS infection and progression to ARF/RHD is not well understood. We conducted a systematic review to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS infection, ARF and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these factors. We identified 1, 164 publications, of which 90 met inclusion criteria, comprising 91 individual studies. The majority of studies reported a positive association between socioeconomic determinants and risk of GAS infection ( 57. 1% ) and ARF/RHD ( 50% ). Crowding was the most assessed factor ( 14 studies with GAS infection, 36 studies with ARF/RHD ), followed by socioeconomic status ( 6 and 36 respectively ). The majority of studies assessing crowding, dwelling characteristics, education and employment status of parents or cases, and nutrition reported a positive association with risk of GAS infection, ARF or RHD. Crowding and socioeconomic status satisfactorily met the criteria of a causal association.
In the PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network, a single point mutation that abolishes the phosphatase activity of the sensor kinase PhoQ results in a striking change in phenotype. The mutant responds to stimulus in a bistable manner, as opposed to the wild-type, which has a graded response. Mutant cells in on and off states have different morphologies, and their state is inherited over many generations. Interestingly, external conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the on state. Mathematical modeling and experiments suggest that the bistability depends on positive autoregulation of the two key proteins in the circuit, PhoP and PhoP. The mutant has a lower fitness in stationary phase cultures in rich medium compared to the off state. However, due to the high inheritance of the on state, a population of on cells can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. Our results demonstrate the remarkable versatility of the prototypical two-component signaling architecture and highlight the tradeoffs in the particular case of the PhoQ/PhoP system.
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis ( PAM ) is a rare but devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. PAM is characterized by a high mortality rate and a lack of established success in treatment. In the absence of economic incentives to develop anti-PAM drugs, anti-PAM drug discovery largely relies on drug repurposing, a cost-effective strategy to apply known drugs for treatment of rare or neglected diseases. Similar to fungi, N. fowleri has an essential requirement for ergosterol, a building block of plasma and cell membranes. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors is a validated interventional strategy against fungal pathogens of medical and agricultural importance. The N. fowleri genome encodes the sterol 14-demethylase ( CYP51 ) target, which shares ~35% sequence identity with fungal orthologues. This similarity raises the possibility of repurposing anti-mycotic drugs and optimizing their usage for the treatment of PAM. In this work, we systematically assessed the impact of anti-fungal azole drugs on sterol biosynthesis and viability of cultured N. fowleri trophozoites, identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate by mass spectrometry analysis of N. fowleri lipids, and analyzed the interactions between the recombinant CYP51 target and conazoles by UV-vis spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. Collectively, the target-based and parasite-based data obtained in these studies validated CYP51 as a potentially ‘druggable’ target in N. fowleri, and conazole drugs as candidates for assessment in the animal model of PAM.
Nematode parasites trigger a host protective type 2 immune response via interleukin-4 receptor alpha ( IL-4Rα ). However, the role of IL-4Rα in maintaining host type 2 immune responses following polarization is not well understood. To determine the role of IL-4Rα after polarization, we used a recently established strain of rosaCreERT2-/+IL-4Rα-/Lox mice where il4rα gene deletion can be temporally controlled. We show that sustained expression of IL-4Rα is required for the maintenance of type 2 immune responses and protective immunity following interruption after polarization with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis primary infection. Moreover, we show by temporal deletion of IL-4Rα prior to secondary infection with N. brasiliensis that signaling via this receptor drives more efficient recall of type 2 immune responses and clearance of the parasites. Together, this study demonstrates that sustained IL-4Rα mediated signaling is required for the maintenance of anti-nematode type 2 immune responses, describing a novel function for IL-4Rα that is distinct from its role in immune polarization. Our studies elucidate previously unknown functions of IL-4Rα mediated signaling beyond its role in the establishment of Th2 immune responses during N. brasiliensis infection.
Bartonella is a genus of bacteria that causes numerous human infections and is prevalent in mammals. We analyzed the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes to date, including 67 new genotypes, and found that this pathogenic genus likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as the reservoirs or key proximate hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. We also found evidence of exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife, likely due to increased contact. Overall, our findings show that Bartonella is a rich system for examining the impacts of humans on patterns of infectious disease spread within species and between species, across landscapes and across the globe.
MALAT1 is a long noncoding RNA that is upregulated in cancer tissues and is associated with hyper-proliferation. We demonstrate that MALAT1 levels are regulated during normal cell cycle progression and is required for G1/S and mitotic progression. Genome-wide transcriptome analyses reveal that MALAT1 modulates the expression of cell cycle genes. Depletion of MALAT1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes, and the cell cycle defects observed in MALAT1-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels. Furthermore, MALAT1-depleted cells display reduced expression of B-MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2/M progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MYB pre-mRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. In human cells, MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle–regulated transcription factors. We propose that abnormal expression of MALAT1 in specific cell types or tissues results in aberrant alternative splicing leading to misexpression of genes that are involved in cell cycle progression and/or cell death, thereby contributing to tumor progression.
Juvenile hormone ( JH ) is a key regulator of insect development, reproduction, and metamorphosis. In locusts, JH acts independently of 20-hydroxyecdysone ( 20E ) to stimulate vitellogenesis and egg production in adult females. However, the molecular basis of JH action in promoting vitellogenesis has not been fully elucidated. We have now demonstrated that JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitellogenesis in migratory locusts. Using RNA interference ( RNAi ) to phenocopy a JH-deprived condition, we have shown that JH stimulates the expression of Mcm4 and Mcm7, two genes in the DNA replication pathway. Depletion of Mcm4 or Mcm7 inhibited de novo DNA synthesis and polyploidization, and resulted in the substantial reduction of vitellogenin mRNA levels as well as severely impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Furthermore, we have shown that the JH receptor, Met, directly regulates the transcription of Mcm4 and Mcm7 by binding to upstream consensus sequences with E-box or E-box-like motifs. Our results suggest that the JH-receptor complex acts on Mcm4 and Mcm7 to regulate DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation.
Leprosy patients with recent nerve function impairment ( NFI ) are commonly treated with prednisolone, but the optimal treatment duration has not yet been established. The “Treatment of Early Neuropathy in Leprosy” ( TENLEP ) trial aimed to determine whether a 32-week prednisolone course is more effective than a 20-week course in restoring and improving nerve function. In this multi-centre, triple-blind, randomized controlled trial, 868 leprosy patients who had recently developed clinical NFI ( <6 months ) were allocated to a prednisolone treatment regimen of either 20 weeks or 32 weeks. Prednisolone was started at either 45 or 60 mg/day, depending on the patient’s body weight, and was then tapered. Throughout follow up, NFI was assessed by voluntary muscle testing and monofilament testing. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at week 78. At 78 weeks, the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ significantly between the groups: 78. 1% in the 20-week arm and 77. 5% in the 32-week arm ( p = 0. 821 ). The results suggest that a 20-week course of prednisolone is as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients.
Male Rocky Mountain elk ( Cervus elaphus nelsoni ) and male European Red Deer ( Cervus elaphus scoticus ) produce different types of vocalizations during the mating season. Elk produce loud and high fundamental frequency bugles, while Red Deer produce loud and low fundamental frequency roaring calls. To understand the relationship between sound complexity and anatomy/physiology, we developed a finite element model of the larynx and a wave propagation model of the vocal tract based on the morphology and biomechanics of the elk. The model can produce a wide range of fundamental frequencies. We found that low fundamental frequencies require low vocal fold strain, but large lung pressure and large glottal flow to achieve high sound intensity levels. In contrast, high-frequency bugles require large muscular effort to strain the vocal ligament and high lung pressure to overcome phonation threshold pressure. However, high-frequency bugles can achieve at least 10 dB more intensity level than low-frequency calls. We also found that glottal efficiency, the ratio of radiated sound power to aerodynamic power at the glottis, is higher in elk, suggesting an advantage of high-pitched signaling. This advantage is based on two aspects: lower airflow required for aerodynamic power and an acoustic radiation advantage at higher frequencies.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) has become the preferred approach for mapping transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin modifications. However, the state of the art for analyzing ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a relevant reference genome ( uni-reads ). This can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads. We describe a general approach for utilizing reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome ( multi-reads ). Our approach is based on allocating multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, we illustrate that incorporation of multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths, leads to detection of novel peaks that are not otherwise identifiable with uni-reads, and improves detection of peaks in mappable regions. Overall, peaks from multi-read analysis have similar characteristics to peaks that are identified by uni-reads except that the majority of them reside in segmental duplications. We further validate a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks by independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identify novel target genes of GATA1. These computational and experimental results establish that multi-reads can be of critical importance for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments.
Neglected tropical diseases ( NTDs ) such as human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease impose a significant economic burden on individuals, particularly in low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs ). The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has set targets to control or eliminate these diseases by 2020. We estimated the economic benefits to individuals of meeting these targets through innovative and intensified disease management ( IDM ). We combined information on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments ( OPPs ) related to these NTDs with projections of the number of people suffering from each disease, country, and year for 2011–2020 and 2021–2030. We compared the ideal scenario in which the WHO’s 2020 targets are met with a counterfactual scenario in which the situation of 1990 stayed unaltered. The economic benefit equaled the difference between the two scenarios. We used probabilistic sensitivity analyses to quantify the degree of uncertainty around the base-case impact estimate. The total global productivity gained for the four IDM-NTDs was estimated to be I$ 23. 1 ( I$ 15. 9–I$ 34. 0 ) billion in 2011–2020 and I$ 35. 9 ( I$ 25. 0–I$ 51. 9 ) billion in 2021–2030. The reduction in OPPs was estimated to be I$ 14 billion ( US$ 6. 7 billion ) and I$ 18 billion ( US$ 10. 4 billion ) for the same periods.
The prevailing theory in neuroscience suggests that neurons with higher selectivity, i. e., responding to a narrower range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external sensory inputs. In the auditory cortex, neuronal responses are less selective immediately after the onset of a sound and then become highly selective in the following sustained response epoch. However, we found that the neural population conveys similar information about sound input across the 2 epochs in spite of the neuronal selectivity differences. The amount of information encoded turns out to be almost completely dependent upon the total number of population spikes in the read-out window for this system. Moreover, inhomogeneous Poisson spiking behavior is sufficient to account for this property. These results imply a novel principle of sensory encoding that is potentially shared widely among multiple sensory systems.
OX40 is a co-stimulatory molecule that plays a critical role in the maintenance of anti-viral T cell responses during chronic viral infections. In contrast to acute viral infections, where T cell responses are followed by a contraction of the anti-viral T cell compartment, chronic viral infections require sustained anti-viral T cell responses to control viral replication and prevent viral spreading. While much is known about the inhibitory signals that limit T cell activity during chronic viral infections, such as PD-1, little is known about the stimulatory signals that allow maintenance of anti-viral T cells. Here, we show that OX40 is a key factor in sustaining anti-viral T cell responses during persistent LCMV clone 13 infection. Anti-viral T cells express high levels of OX40 in the presence of their cognate antigen, and T cells lacking the OX40 receptor fail to accumulate sufficiently. Moreover, the emergence of T cell dependent germinal center responses and LCMV-specific antibodies are severely impaired in OX40-deficient mice. Consequently, OX40-deficient mice fail to control LCMV clone 13 infection over time, highlighting the importance of this signaling pathway during persistent viral infection.
Convergent evolution is the process by which different species evolve similar traits independently of a common ancestor. Here, we show that a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla. The optimal specific wavelength ( OSW ), which is the length of an undulation along an animal’s fin during swimming divided by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin length, is consistently around twenty. This value maximizes the force generated by the body, which in turn maximizes swimming speed. We hypothesize a mechanical basis for this optimality and suggest reasons for its repeated emergence through evolution. Unlike the case of the convergently evolved wing, the evolved feature here is a pattern of movement that occurs across a morphologically diverse set of moving appendages on aquatic animals. These animals swim by undulating elongated fins while keeping their body relatively rigid. We hypothesize that regulation of the OSW, axial elongation, and fin elongation in the phyla in which we observe these traits may reflect the action of common genetic networks. This phenomenon unifies a vast diversity of swimming organisms, from invertebrates, like cuttlefish, to vertebrates, like cartilaginous and bony fish.
Condensins I and II are a class of evolutionarily conserved protein complexes that play a central role in chromosome assembly and segregation in eukaryotes. Here, we report the first comprehensive genetic study of mammalian condensins, demonstrating that both condensin I and II are essential for neural stem cell ( NSC ) divisions and survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condensins leads to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, causing DNA damage and triggering p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condensins I and II lead to slower loss of NSCs compared to simultaneous depletion, but display distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation was observed more prominently in NSCs depleted of condensin II, whereas mitotic delays were detectable only in condensin I-depleted NSCs. Notably, NSCs depleted of condensin II display hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating that condensin II, but not condensin I, plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture. Our results demonstrate that condensins I and II have overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, and also provide evolutionary insight into the intricate balancing acts of the two condensin complexes.
Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic flatworm, is unusual among hermaphroditic trematodes because it has evolved gonochorism, where sex is determined by a female heterogametic system. However, phenotypic sexual dimorphism appears only after infection of the vertebrate definitive host, and the molecular mechanisms that trigger sexual differentiation remain unknown. To study the molecular basis of sex determination and sexual differentiation in schistosomes, we investigated the whole transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage- and sex-comparative manner. We performed RNA-seq on males and females for five developmental stages: cercariae larvae, three in vivo schistosomulum stages, and adults. We detected 7, 168 genes differentially expressed between sexes in at least one of the developmental stages, and 4, 065 of them were functionally annotated. Our results suggest that sexual differentiation in S. mansoni is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes of known players of the host-parasite crosstalk, genetic determinants, and epigenetic regulators. We propose that such combination could lead to the optimized sexual dimorphism of this parasitic species.
We propose an approach for modeling disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts. Our approach assigns a confidence value ( i. e., the posterior probability that an annotation is correct ) to each annotation. We developed two probabilistic models for performing this analysis and compared them using computer simulation and actual performance based on a large data set generated by human annotators. We show that our approach can significantly increase the probability of choosing the correct annotation, even in the worst-case scenario when all annotators disagree. We also make publicly available a corpus of 10, 000 sentences annotated according to several cardinal dimensions. The corpus was annotated by a group of eight experts, and a 1, 000-sentence subset was further annotated by five new experts. Our approach is general and can be applied to most data annotation studies. We suggest an internally consistent way to design annotation experiments and analyze curation data. We propose a holistic approach to quantify our certainty in individual annotations for a group of several annotators, which allows us to retain the complete dataset as a basis for training and testing machine learning methods.
Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome ( HPS ), caused by Andes virus ( ANDV ) and ANDV-like viruses, is responsible for most HPS cases in South America. Convalescent human plasma has shown promise as a possible treatment for HPS, but its availability is limited. We have explored the concept of using DNA vaccine technology to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, for use in humans. Geese were vaccinated with an ANDV DNA vaccine encoding the virus envelope glycoproteins and developed high-titer neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination. These antibodies were purified from egg yolks and shown to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins. We examined the protective efficacy of the goose-derived antibody in the hamster model of lethal HPS. Hamsters were passively transferred with α-ANDV immune sera or IgY/IgYΔFc purified from eggs starting 5 days after an IM challenge with ANDV. Both immune sera and egg-derived purified IgY/IgYΔFc protected 8 of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters, respectively. In contrast, all hamsters receiving IgY/IgYΔFc purified from normal geese or no treatment developed lethal HPS. These findings demonstrate that the DNA vaccine/goose platform can be used to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure.
Dnmt3a is a DNA methyltransferase enzyme that plays an important role in the establishment of normal methylation patterns in the genome. We have used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to comprehensively characterize the methylomes from Dnmt3a wildtype and Dnmt3a-deficient mouse lung tumors. Our results show that Dnmt3a wildtype tumors are characterized by large hypomethylated domains that correspond to nuclear lamina-associated domains. In contrast, Dnmt3a-deficient tumors show a uniformly hypomethylated genome. Further data analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is required for efficient maintenance methylation of active chromosome domains and that Dnmt3a-deficient tumors show moderate levels of gene deregulation in these domains. We have also shown that Dnmt3a is expressed in normal mouse lung tissue and in K-ras dependent mouse lung tumors, and that deletion of Dnmt3a has been shown to promote K-ras dependent lung tumor progression. Our results uncover conserved features of cancer methylomes and define the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns in cancer.
Neural activity in the premotor cortex of songbirds has been found to be spatially and temporally organized in a way that supports the generation of sparse sequences of neural activity. This organization is characterized by a length scale of 100 µm and a local 30 Hz network rhythm. Within this length scale, basal-ganglia–projecting excitatory neurons fire at a specific phase of the 30 Hz rhythm, while inhibitory neurons show patterned activity throughout song. Projection neurons, on the other hand, fire sparsely, with calcium events that are correlated in time between neighbors. This suggests a microcircuit in which multiple pools of excitatory neurons drive local interneuron populations. The spatial clustering of activity patterns of excitatory and inhibitory neurons, as well as the 30 Hz rhythmic alternation of excitatory and inhibitory cells, may be a recurring feature of cortical motor microcircuits and critical for the sequential organization of behavior. These results suggest that future biophysical models of motor sequence generation in the songbird premotor cortex should consider the interplay of spatially correlated patterns of excitation and inhibition as the basis of the stereotyped, robust sequences of neural activity driving birdsong.
Lifespan is regulated by both genetic and environmental factors in many species. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1/daf-2 signaling pathway has been identified as a key regulator of aging. Loss-of-function mutations in daf-2 can more than double the lifespan of C. elegans, and lifespan can be extended when the insulin receptor/daf-2 is inactivated at any developmental larval stage through adulthood. Conditional daf-2 alleles cause dauer arrest if the gene is inactivated at the L1 stage but increased longevity if inactivated in adults. Null alleles of daf-2 are lethal, demonstrating the necessity of uncoupling the developmental and aging phenotypes of essential genes. We screened 2, 700 genes essential for C. elegans development and identified 64 genes that extend lifespan when inactivated postdevelopmentally. These candidate lifespan regulators are highly conserved from yeast to humans and can be classified into functional groups, including insulin and metabolic pathways, as well as translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Many of these essential gene inactivations extend lifespan as much as the strongest known regulators of aging.
During zebrafish fin regeneration, the first critical step is the formation of a specialized epidermis that instructs growth from the underlying stump tissue. A forward genetic screen in zebrafish identified a temperature-sensitive allele of the ECM component laminin beta 1a ( lamb1a ) that blocks fin regeneration. We found that lamb1a is sharply induced in a subset of epithelial cells after fin amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial cell layer. These events facilitate expression of the morphogenetic factors shha and lef1, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf1r, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. By contrast, lamb1a function is dispensable for juvenile body growth, homeostatic adult tissue maintenance, repair of split fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts. Our findings reveal transient induction of lamb1a in epithelial cells as a key, growth factor-guided step in formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis. We also found that the Fgf ligand gene fgf20a is induced during zebrafish fin regeneration and that fgf20a mutants are defective in lef1 induction and maturation of the regeneration epidermis.
Genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) are a powerful tool for identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases. However, they can be affected by population substructure and relatedness between individuals, which can lead to false positives. Here, we compare the performance of several linear mixed model ( LMM ) approaches for modelling population substructure and relatedness in GWAS. We applied these approaches to a GWAS of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3626 individuals. We compared the performance of six LMM software packages ( EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA and MMM ), as well as alternative approaches implemented in MQLS, ROADTRIPS and MASTOR. We found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all were successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate. We also found high correlation between LMMs and alternative approaches, apart from transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. We conclude that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches, and that the choice of LMM implementation should be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use rather than power or type I error considerations.
Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major public health problem in Latin America. The currently available drugs have toxic side effects and are only effective against the acute phase of the disease, while there is no treatment for the chronic stage. In this study, we developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that inhibit T. cruzi infection of mammalian cells. We screened a 2000-compound chemical library and identified three compounds, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, with high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells. Each of these compounds has a different mechanism of action against intracellular T. cruzi amastigotes, with CX1 showing strong trypanocidal activity, NT1 having a trypanostatic effect, and PCH1 affecting parasite division. These compounds also showed high activity against T. cruzi from the Y strain and against the related kinetoplastid species Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. In addition, we identified two new compounds, PCH6 and CX2, with IC50 values of 2 nM, approximately 100 times lower than the currently available drugs. These results provide new candidate molecules for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis.
Molecular xenomonitoring efforts for lymphatic filariasis rely on PCR or real-time PCR-based detection of Brugia malayi, Brugia timori and Wuchereria bancrofti in mosquito vectors. However, current methods are time consuming, costly and require expensive thermal cyclers or real-time PCR instruments. We present a novel diagnostic approach for molecular xenomonitoring of filarial parasites in mosquitoes that uses a rapid, NaOH-based DNA extraction methodology coupled with a portable, battery powered PCR platform and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. We evaluated the performance of a rapid, NaOH-based methodology for the extraction of total DNA from pools of parasite-spiked vector mosquitoes and compared it to standard silica column-based DNA extraction techniques. We also compared our novel test strip-based detection assay to real-time PCR and conventional PCR coupled with gel electrophoresis, and demonstrated that this method provides sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA from extracted mosquito pools. We have also demonstrated the potential for the point-of-collection-based use of this entire diagnostic platform that is compact enough to fit into a small backpack. This field-ready system should increase the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring within B. malayi-endemic locations and provides the proof-of-concept framework for the development of a parallel assay for the detection of W. bancrofti.
Elastomeric proteins are a class of proteins that have evolved independently multiple times through evolution. They are composed of an alternating domain architecture of elastomeric domains interspersed with cross-linking elements. The former provide elasticity and help drive the assembly process, while the latter serve to stabilise the polymer. Here, we present a theoretical study that examines the impact of domain architecture on polymer assembly and integrity. We developed a novel simulation environment that uses a model of diffusion limited aggregation to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with alternating domain architectures. Our results show that the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains can significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the resultant polymeric structure. For example, the most highly connected polymers were those constructed from asymmetric rods consisting of relatively large cross-linking elements interspersed with smaller elastomeric domains. These results provide insights into the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins as well as help guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides.
The 5′ untranslated regions ( UTRs ) of the Zaire ebolavirus ( EBOV ) genome, which are longer than those of most other non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses, do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites ( IRESes ). Instead, they modulate cap-dependent translation in a position-dependent manner. The 5′-UTR derived from the viral polymerase ( L ) mRNA strongly suppresses translation of a reporter gene compared to a β-actin 5′-UTR. The L 5′-UTR is one of four viral genes to possess upstream AUGs ( uAUGs ), and ablation of each uAUG enhances translation of the primary open reading frame ( pORF ), most dramatically in the case of the L 5′-UTR. The L uAUG is sufficient to initiate translation, is surrounded by a “weak” Kozak sequence, and suppresses pORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2α is phosphorylated, the presence of the uORF maintains translation of the L pORF, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. Mutating two nucleotides outside of previously-defined protein coding and cis-acting regulatory sequences in the L uAUG attenuates virus growth to titers 10–100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells.
DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) in the human genome have been studied extensively for their role in cancer development and genomic instability. We have developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSBs in human chromosomes and observed non-random fragmentation and DSB hot spots. These hot spots are scattered along chromosomes and delimit protected 50–250 kb DNA domains, which we denote as forum domains. We found that about 30% of these domains possess coordinately expressed genes and that PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 specifically bind DNA sequences at the forum domain termini. Our data suggest a novel type of gene regulation: a coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters delimited by DSB hot spots as well as PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 binding sites. These findings highlight the relationship between human chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for cancer genomics and gene therapy. Our data also suggest that the binding of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 at the forum domain termini may influence coordinated transcription within these domains.
Trypanosomatids, including Crithidia mellificae, were isolated and characterized in bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Bats were captured in two areas with different levels of degradation: Reserva Ecológica de Guapiaçu ( REGUA ) and Estação Fiocruz Mata Atlântica ( EFMA ). The study evaluated whether the diversity of trypanosomatids changes according to bat diversity and the different levels of preservation in the region. The results showed no influence of the level of preservation on bat species richness, with similar chiropterofauna and higher abundance of Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus. Trypanosoma dionisii was the most frequently detected parasite ( 54% ), followed by T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV and Trypanosoma sp., in Neotropical phyllostomid bats. Mixed infections by T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcIII and T. dionisii/T. cruzi TcI were also observed. The T. cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV are the genotypes currently involved in cases of acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and T. dionisii was recently found in the heart tissue of an infected child. We also describe for the first time Crithidia mellificae, a putative monoxenous parasite from insects, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas. Bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro state harbor a great diversity of trypanosomatids, maintaining trypanosomatid diversity in this sylvatic environment.
Ticks are the most common arthropod vectors of both human and animal diseases in Europe, and the Ixodes ricinus tick species is able to transmit a large number of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. In this study, we evaluated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and four symbionts in 267 Ixodes ricinus female specimens collected in the French Ardennes. We used high-throughput real-time PCR to detect the presence of 37 pathogens, rRT-PCR to detect Tick-Borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ), and nested PCR to detect four symbionts. We found that 45% of the infected ticks were co-infected with up to five different pathogens, and when adding symbiont prevalences, all ticks were infected by at least one microorganism, and up to eight microorganisms were identified in the same tick. We also found a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii, whereas there were no significant interactions between symbionts and pathogens. Our study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates in ticks, raising questions about possible co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals, and their consequences to human and animal health. We also demonstrated high prevalence rates of symbionts co-existing with pathogens, opening new avenues of enquiry regarding their effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence.
Hematopoietic stem cell lineage choices are determined by genetic networks that switch between a primed state and a committed state in a switch-like manner. We develop a computational model for the hematopoietic erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, which is determined by a genetic switch involving the genes PU. 1 and GATA-1. However, dynamical models based upon known interactions between these master genes fail to make the system bistable, a desired feature for robust lineage determination. We therefore suggest a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated as well as recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner that is necessary for bistability and hence switch-like behavior. The PU. 1–GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of its upstream master genes and further reinforces the decision due to several feedback loops, thereby leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch, which handles the erythroid-myeloid lineage decision, is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. The approach points to a framework for lineage commitment studies in general and could aid the search for lineage-determining genes.
Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen with a high level of resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. Lysozyme resistance in E. faecalis requires a complex network of transcriptional regulators and several genes acting synergistically to inhibit both the enzymatic and cationic antimicrobial peptide activities of lysozyme. To identify novel genes modulating E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme, we carried out random transposon mutagenesis in the quadruple oatA/pgdA/dltA/sigV mutant. This led to the identification of several independent insertions in a locus referred to as the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen ( EPA ) variable region located downstream of the highly conserved epaA-epaR genes. We show that EPA decoration contributes to resistance towards charged antimicrobials and underpins virulence in the zebrafish model of infection by conferring resistance to phagocytosis. Our results indicate that the production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is not sufficient to promote E. faecalis infections and reveal an essential role of the modification of this surface polymer for enterococcal pathogenesis.
Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) is a type of blood cancer characterized by a complex interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and post-transcriptional regulatory factors. We developed RACER ( Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation ), a novel two-stage regression framework that integrates genome-wide data from The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ( ENCODE ). RACER first infers sample-specific regulatory activities of transcription factors ( TFs ) and microRNAs ( miRNAs ), which are then used to infer TF/miRNA-gene interactions. This approach circumvents the difficulty of integrating ENCODE data measured in generic cell lines with sample-specific TCGA measurements. As a case study, we applied RACER to AML data from TCGA and related TF binding data measured in K562 from ENCODE. We first verified RACER's model formalism by 10-fold cross-validation on predicting gene expression. We then evaluated RACER on recovering known regulatory interactions and demonstrated its superior statistical power over existing methods in detecting known miRNA/TF targets. Additionally, we developed a feature selection procedure that identified 18 regulators, whose activities clustered consistently with cytogenetic risk groups. One of the selected regulators, miR-548p, was found to have inferred targets significantly enriched for leukemia-related pathways, implicating its novel role in AML pathogenesis. Furthermore, survival analysis using the inferred activities identified C-Fos as a potential AML prognostic marker.
Colletotrichum higginsianum is a phytopathogenic fungus that infects a wide range of crops worldwide. To investigate the role of RNA silencing in C. higginsianum, we generated knock-out mutants affecting genes for three RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RDR ), two Dicer-like ( DCL ), and two Argonaute ( AGO ) proteins. We observed no effects on vegetative growth for any mutant strain when grown on complex or minimal media. However, Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2 double mutant, and Δago1 strains showed severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Total RNA transcripts and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains. The greatest effects on both RNA populations were observed in the Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2, and Δago1 strains, in which a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletotrichum higginsianum non-segmented dsRNA virus 1 ( ChNRV1 ), was derepressed. Phylogenetic analyses revealed a close relationship between ChNRV1 and members of the segmented Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO1 showed abundant loading of 5’U-containing viral siRNA. C. higginsianum parental and Δdcl1 mutant strains cured of ChNRV1 revealed that the conidiation and spore morphology defects were primarily caused by ChNRV1. Based on these results, RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum is proposed to function as an antiviral mechanism.
Histone acetyltransferase ( HAT ) MOF is involved in all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation expansion during male meiotic prophase I in mice. The first two waves of H2AX phosphorylation are ATM-dependent and occur during leptotene and zygotene stages, while the third wave is ATR-dependent and occurs during pachytene stage. The third wave of H2AX phosphorylation marks and silences unsynapsed chromosomes. Germ cell-specific deletion of Mof in spermatocytes by Stra8-Cre ( Mof cKO ) causes global loss of H4K16ac. In leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes of cKO mice, the γH2AX signals were observed only along the chromosomal axes, and chromatin-wide H2AX phosphorylation was lost. In almost 40% of early-mid pachytene spermatocytes from Mof cKO mice, γH2AX and MDC1 were detected along the unsynapsed axes of the sex chromosomes, but failed to expand, which consequently caused meiotic sex chromosome inactivation ( MSCI ) failure. Furthermore, though RAD51 was proficiently recruited to double-strand break ( DSB ) sites, defects in DSB repair and crossover formation were observed in Mof cKO spermatocytes, indicating that MOF facilitates meiotic DSB repair after RAD51 recruitment. We propose that MOF regulates male meiosis and is involved in the expansion of all three waves of H2AX phosphorylation from the leptotene to pachytene stages, initiated by ATM and ATR, respectively.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 ( HTLV-1 ) infection has the potential to perturb thymic human αβ T-cell development. We investigated the in vivo effects of HTLV-1 infection in a “Human Immune System” ( HIS ) Rag2-/-γc-/- mouse model. These mice were infected with HTLV-1 at a time when the three main subpopulations of human thymocytes have been detected. In all but two inoculated mice, the HTLV-1 provirus was found integrated in thymocytes; the proviral load increased with the length of the infection period. In the HTLV-1-infected mice we observed alterations in human T-cell development, the extent of which correlated with the proviral load. Thus, in the thymus of HTLV-1-infected HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- mice, mature single-positive ( SP ) CD4+ and CD8+ cells were most numerous, at the expense of immature and double-positive ( DP ) thymocytes. These SP cells also accumulated in the spleen. Human lymphocytes from thymus and spleen were activated, as shown by the expression of CD25: this activation was correlated with the presence of tax mRNA and with increased expression of NF-kB dependent genes such as bfl-1, an anti-apoptotic gene, in thymocytes. Finally, hepato-splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and lymphoma/thymoma, in which Tax was detected, were observed in HTLV-1-infected mice, several months after HTLV-1 infection. These results demonstrate the potential of the HIS Rag2-/-γc-/- animal model to elucidate the initial steps of the leukemogenic process induced by HTLV-1.
Schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern in Sudan, particularly urogenital schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium. An integrated control project implemented by the Korea International Cooperation Agency ( KOICA ) in Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State, Sudan from 2009 to 2011 aimed to reduce the prevalence of schistosomiasis. The project targeted 78, 615 primary school students out of a total population of 482, 902. The prevalence of S. haematobium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28. 5% and 0. 4%, respectively. After 6–9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced to 13. 5% ( 95% CI = 0. 331–0. 462 ). A higher reduction in prevalence was observed among girls, those with moderately infected status ( around 20% ), and residents in rural areas, than among boys, those with high prevalence ( >40% ), and residents in urban areas. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection showed no significant change between baseline and follow-up survey ( 95% CI = 0. 933–6. 891 ). The prevalence of S. haematobium infection was reduced by more than 50% at the end of the project. Approximately 200, 000 subjects received either praziquantel therapy, health education, or supply of clean water.
Nipah virus ( NiV ) is a highly pathogenic emerging paramyxovirus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 ( BSL4 ) pathogen. We report here that the nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the Nipah virus matrix ( NiV-M ) protein and associated post-translational modification play a critical role in matrix-mediated virus budding. During live NiV infection, NiV-M was first detected in the nucleus at early stages of infection before subsequent localization to the cytoplasm and the plasma membrane. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization signal ( NLS ) and the leucine-rich nuclear export signal ( NES ) found in NiV-M impaired its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and also abolished NiV-M budding. A highly conserved lysine residue in the NLS served dual functions: its positive charge was important for mediating nuclear import, and it was also a potential site for monoubiquitination which regulates nuclear export of the protein. Concordantly, overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced NiV-M budding whereas depletion of free ubiquitin in the cell ( via proteasome inhibitors ) resulted in nuclear retention of NiV-M and blocked viral budding. Live Nipah virus budding was exquisitely sensitive to proteasome inhibitors: bortezomib, an FDA-approved proteasome inhibitor for treating multiple myeloma, reduced viral titers with an IC50 of 2. 7 nM, which is 100-fold less than the peak plasma concentration that can be achieved in humans.
Poliovirus ( PV ) is a nonenveloped virus that causes human poliomyelitis and is closely related to other important human viral pathogens. The mechanisms by which nonenveloped viruses, such as PV, deliver their genomes into host cells are poorly understood due to technical difficulties in direct visualization of viral gene delivery and uncertainties in distinguishing productive and nonproductive pathways. Here, we combine an imaging assay that simultaneously tracks the viral capsid and genome in live cells with an infectivity-based assay for RNA release to characterize the early events in the PV infection. We observe that genome release by PV is highly efficient and rapid, and thus does not limit the overall infectivity or the infection rate. The results define a pathway in which PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell by a clathrin-, caveolin-, flotillin-, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine kinase- and actin-dependent, endocytic mechanism. Immediately after the internalization of the virus particle, genome release takes place from vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations located within 100–200 nm of the plasma membrane. These results settle a long-lasting debate of whether PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell.
Dengue fever continues to be a major public health problem in Cambodia, with a significant impact on children. The National Dengue Control Program ( NDCP ) delivers health education to communities and in schools as a major means for prevention and control. However, this education is not systematically evaluated, is under-funded, and delivered irregularly. As a result, adherence to dengue prevention and control measures is partial. Community health education is provided through health centre outreach activities and campaigns of the NDCP, but lacks follow-up in terms of practical activities for prevention and control. School-based education is restricted in terms of time and lacks follow-up in terms of practical activities. Local prevention and control activities, involving community members and supported through health education within the community and in schools, offer potential to reduce the prevalence of dengue. However, this cannot occur where health education is poorly resourced and episodic, and where attention is not paid to the translation of knowledge to practice.
Filarial nematodes cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals. To improve diagnosis and our understanding of the molecular basis for host-parasite interactions, we investigated the presence of circulating microRNAs ( miRNAs ) released by filarial nematodes into the host bloodstream. We found over 200 mature miRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in Dirofilaria immitis-infected dog plasma in two independent analyses, and 21 in Onchocerca volvulus-infected human serum. Total RNA obtained from D. immitis-infected dog plasma was subjected to stem-loop RT-qPCR assays targeting two detected miRNA candidates, miR-71 and miR-34. The presence of miR-71 and miR-34 discriminated infected samples from uninfected samples, in which no specific miRNA amplification occurred. However, absolute miRNA copy numbers were not significantly correlated with microfilaraemia for either parasite. This may be due to the imprecision of mf counts to estimate infection intensity or to miRNA contributions from the unknown number of adult worms present. We identified a large number of candidate circulating miRNAs in samples of mammalian hosts infected with several species of filarial nematodes. We found 245 and 261 candidate miRNAs in independent samples of plasma obtained from heartworm-infected dogs.
Tyrosine kinases of the Src family are large allosteric enzymes that play a key role in cellular signaling. The conversion of the kinase from an inactive to an active state is accompanied by substantial structural changes. Here, we construct a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain incorporating experimental structures for the two stable states, and simulate the dynamics of conformational transitions in kinase activation. We explore the transition energy landscapes by constructing a structural network among clusters of conformations from the simulations. From the structural network, two major ensembles of pathways for the activation are identified. In the first transition pathway, we find a coordinated switching mechanism of interactions among the αC helix, the activation-loop, and the β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. In a second pathway, the conformational change is coupled to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe region of the catalytic domain. We also characterize the switching mechanism for the αC helix and the activation-loop in detail. Finally, we test the performance of a Markov model and its ability to account for the structural kinetics in the context of Src conformational changes. Taken together, these results provide a broad framework for understanding the main features of the conformational transition taking place upon Src activation.
Lethality in interploidy crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana has been shown to be controlled by the maternally expressed WRKY transcription factor TTG2. We have identified a single large-effect QTL, DR. STRANGELOVE 1 ( DSL1 ), which affects the rate of postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal effect transcription factor TTG2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by both natural variation and ttg2 loss-of-function mutants. The simple genetic basis of the natural variation and effects of single-gene mutations suggest that F1 lethality in polyploids could evolve rapidly. Furthermore, the role of the sporophytically active TTG2 gene in interploidy crosses indicates that the developmental programming of the mother regulates the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring. Genome-wide scans for epistatic interactions with DSL1 were carried out by regression analysis. We propose that allelic variation at TTG2 could explain the DSL1 QTL. Loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 isolated from both the Ler and Col backgrounds improved interploidy crossing success.
Bartonella spp. and Leptospira spp. are bacterial pathogens that infect mammals, including bats and rodents, and can be transmitted to humans. In this study, we examined the coevolutionary patterns of these pathogens with their mammalian hosts. We analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. We found that Bartonella spp. and their bat and rodent hosts had significant coevolutionary congruence, indicating that these pathogens and their hosts have evolved together over time. In contrast, the relationship between Leptospira and their bat hosts was non-significant. Event-based cophylogeny analyses revealed that Bartonella and rodents had the fewest host switches per parasite, while Leptospira and bats had the greatest number of host switches. This suggests that Bartonella has coevolved with its rodent and bat hosts with minimal host switching, while Leptospira in bats lacks evolutionary congruence with its host and has a high number of host switches.
Undulatory swimmers, such as fish and eels, produce complex deformation kinematics that lead to movement. However, it is not clear whether complicated muscle forcing is required to create these kinematics. In this work, a forced damped oscillation framework is applied to a chain-link model of undulatory swimming to understand how forcing leads to deformation and movement. We show that the forcing triggers the first few deformation modes of the body, which in turn cause the translational motion. We also show that relatively simple forcing patterns can trigger seemingly complex deformation kinematics that lead to movement. For given muscle activation, the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is important for the emergent deformation characteristics of the body. We show that the power generated from muscle work is used in creating body deformations and then dissipated into the surrounding fluid. A closed form expression for swimming velocity is derived by a leading-order analysis of the equations of motion.
Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT ) or sleeping sickness, can generate new strains of the human pathogen T. b. rhodesiense ( Tbr ) by genetic recombination with the animal-infective subspecies T. b. brucei ( Tbb ). The human infectivity of Tbr is conferred by a single gene, SRA, which is potentially transferable to Tbb by sexual reproduction. We show that SRA is readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds by sexual reproduction between Tbr and Tbb, thus creating new strains of the human pathogen Tbr. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of hybrid trypanosomes carrying SRA. The SRA gene exists as a single copy in a representative collection of Tbr strains and is found on one homologue of chromosome IV in the majority of Tbr isolates examined. However, some Ugandan Tbr had SRA on both homologues. The mobility of SRA by genetic recombination readily explains the observed genetic variability of Tbr in East Africa. We conclude that new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the much larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes. Such novel recombinants present a risk for future outbreaks of HAT.
Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus ( NDM ) is caused by dysfunction of β-cells in the islets of Langerhans, disrupting insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling between β-cells in the islet plays a major role in coordinating a pulsatile secretory response at elevated glucose and suppressing insulin secretion at basal glucose. We examined the mechanisms by which gap junction coupling contributes to islet dysfunction in NDM. We first verified a computational model against [Ca2+] and insulin secretion measurements in islets expressing ATP-insensitive KATP channels under different levels of gap junction coupling. We then applied this model to predict how different KATP channel mutations found in NDM suppress [Ca2+], and the role of gap junction coupling in this suppression. We further extended the model to account for stochastic noise and insulin secretion dynamics. We found that reductions in gap junction coupling allow progressively greater glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] and insulin secretion following expression of ATP-insensitive KATP channels. The model demonstrated good correspondence between suppression of [Ca2+] and clinical presentation of different NDM mutations. Significant recoveries in [Ca2+] and insulin secretion were predicted for many mutations upon reductions in gap junction coupling, where stochastic noise played a significant role in the recoveries. These findings provide new understanding of how the islet functions as a multicellular system and for the role of gap junction channels in exacerbating the effects of decreased cellular excitability.
The dynamic behavior of large gene transcription networks is difficult to predict from the behavior of their composing modules because modules display context-dependent behavior. One cause of this context-dependence is retroactivity, a phenomenon similar to loading that influences the dynamic performance of a module upon connection to other modules. Here, we establish an analysis framework for gene transcription networks that explicitly accounts for retroactivity. The framework is based on three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity. These matrices have a physical interpretation and can be computed from macroscopic parameters ( dissociation constants and promoter concentrations ) and from the modules' topology. The internal retroactivity quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on an isolated module's dynamics. The scaling and mixing retroactivity establish how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules. Based on these matrices and on the dynamics of modules in isolation, we can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules. We illustrate implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity on the performance of recurrent network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. We further provide a quantitative metric that determines how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules.
Recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region 1 ( PAR1 ) is essential for the proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in male meiosis, and its deletion results in male sterility. PAR1 has an exceptionally high male crossover rate, which is 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. However, the mechanism by which this obligatory crossover occurs remains unknown, as does the fine-scale positioning of crossovers across this region. Recent research in mice has suggested that crossovers in PAR may be mediated independently of the protein PRDM9. To investigate recombination in this region, we constructed the most fine-scale genetic map containing directly observed crossovers to date using African-American pedigrees. We also leveraged recombination rates inferred from the breakdown of linkage disequilibrium in human populations and investigated the signatures of DNA evolution due to recombination. We identified direct PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells and found that, in contrast with mouse, PRDM9 localises peaks of recombination in the human PAR1. We also found that recombination is a far more rapid and intense driver of sequence evolution in PAR1 than it is on the autosomes, and that PAR1 hotspot activities differ significantly among human populations. Finally, we found evidence that PAR1 hotspot positions have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no evidence of sharing among the hottest hotspots.
Histone demethylase JMJD2A/KDM4A is involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation. In proliferating myoblasts, muscle-specific genes are silenced by epigenetic modifications at their promoters, including histone H3K9 methylation. To initiate muscle differentiation, the promoter of the myogenic factor myogenin ( Myog ) must be derepressed. Here, we identify a new isoform of JMJD2A, ΔN-JMJD2A, which lacks the N-terminal demethylase domain. ΔN-JMJD2A is upregulated at the onset of myoblast differentiation into myotubes and is essential for this process. Genome-wide expression profiling and exon-specific siRNA knockdown indicate that ΔN-JMJD2A is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. Moreover, ΔN-JMJD2A promotes MyoD-induced conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells. ChIP-on-chip analysis indicates that ΔN-JMJD2A binds to genes mainly involved in transcriptional control and that this binding is linked to gene activation. ΔN-JMJD2A is recruited to the Myog promoter at the onset of differentiation and promotes the demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3K9me3. We conclude that induction of the ΔN-JMJD2A isoform is crucial for muscle differentiation by directing the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter and promoting transcriptional activation of the Myog gene.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme ( GWEP ) is in its final stages, with only 25 reported cases in 2016. We analyze the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP in the end game, when the number of cases is lower and the cost per case is higher than at any other time. We estimate the cost of the implementation, pre-certification and certification stages using data from the GWEP and model cost-effectiveness in the period 1986–2030. We compare the GWEP to two alternative scenarios: doing nothing ( no intervention since 1986 ) and control ( only surveillance and outbreak response during 2016–2030 ). We report the cost per case averted, cost per disability adjusted life year ( DALY ) averted and cost per at-risk life year averted. The GWEP cost an estimated US$ 11 ( 95% uncertainty interval, 4. 70–12. 49 ) per case averted in the period 1986–2030. The cost per DALY averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing is estimated at US$ 222 ( 118–372 ) in 1986–2030. The GWEP is probably more cost-effective than control by the year 2030. Even if economic costs are two times as high as the financial costs estimated for the period to 2020, the GWEP will still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing.
Lyme disease spirochetes of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex have evolved mechanisms to evade the human complement system, a key component of the innate immune response. The classical complement pathway is controlled by the first component of complement, C1, which is a multi-protein complex composed of C1q bound to a heterotetramer of two serine proteases, C1r and C1s. In this study, we investigated the function of the carboxy-terminal domain of the BBK32 protein from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, termed BBK32-C, which binds and inhibits the initiating serine protease of the human classical complement pathway, C1r. Our data show that BBK32-C exhibits high-affinity binding to purified C1r protease and C1 complex, and potent inhibition of the classical complement pathway. We solved the crystal structure of BBK32-C to 1. 7Å limiting resolution and found that it adopts an anti-parallel four-helix bundle fold with a fifth alpha-helix protruding from the helical core. The structure revealed that the three residues targeted in the BXK32-C chimera are surface-exposed, further supporting their potential relevance in C1r binding and inhibition. Our results suggest that BBK32-mediated complement evasion activity is shared across major species of Lyme disease-associated spirochetes.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity. Previous gene-knockout studies have identified factors involved in this transformation, but it remains unclear how these factors are regulated to coordinate the switch. Here, we have identified the Fkh2 transcription factor as a regulatory target of both the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. We show that Fkh2 undergoes a radical shift in its phosphorylation profile upon hyphal induction, mediated by Cdc28-Ccn1/Cln3 and Cbk1-Mob2. This shift specifically activates Fkh2 to promote the expression of genes required for pathogenic processes in addition to its normal general housekeeping function. Importantly, the phosphorylation profile of Fkh2 undergoes a transient transformation upon hyphal induction, which is dependent on phosphorylation at the six full Cdc28 target sites. We show that this transformation is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. Furthermore, we have identified that Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, thereby providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity.
Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite, possesses both de novo and salvage routes for the biosynthesis of pyrimidine nucleotides. We show that thymidine kinase ( TK ) is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model, and that a catalytically active enzyme is required for its function. Unlike humans, T. brucei lacks dCMP deaminase ( DCTD ), which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DCTD resulted in full rescue of the RNAi growth phenotype and allowed for selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling revealed a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides in TK depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase ( CDA ), which converts deoxycytidine to deoxyuridine, led to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy. These results suggest that T. brucei encodes an unidentified 5’-nucleotidase that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their corresponding nucleosides, leading to their dead-end buildup in TK depleted cells at the expense of dTTP pools. Bioinformatics analysis identified several potential candidate genes that could encode 5’-nucleotidase activity, including an HD-domain protein that we show catalyzes dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleotide 5’-monophosphates. We conclude that TK is essential for synthesis of thymine nucleotides regardless of whether the nucleoside precursors originate from the de novo pathway or through salvage.
The initiation of translation in prokaryotic systems is a highly regulated process that usually requires interaction between the ribosome and an mRNA sequence upstream of the initiation codon, the ribosome-binding site ( Shine-Dalgarno sequence ). However, a large number of genes do not possess Shine-Dalgarno sequences, and it is unknown how start codon recognition occurs in these mRNAs. We have performed genome-wide searches in various groups of prokaryotes to identify sequence elements and/or RNA secondary structural motifs that could mediate translation initiation in mRNAs lacking Shine-Dalgarno sequences. We find that mRNAs without a Shine-Dalgarno sequence are generally less structured in their translation initiation region and show a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Using reporter gene constructs in bacteria, we provide experimental support for local RNA unfoldedness determining start codon recognition in Shine-Dalgarno–independent translation. Our results suggest that local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient to initiate Shine-Dalgarno–independent translation.
Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis ( PKDL ) is a skin disorder that occurs in up to 10% of patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) in India. The pathogenesis of PKDL is not yet fully understood. In Bihar, India, a region highly endemic for Leishmania donovani, Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) treated 8749 patients with 20 mg/kg intravenous liposomal amphotericin B ( Ambisome ) as first-line treatment for VL between July 2007 and August 2012. Of the 8311 patients completing treatment, 24 ( 0. 3% ) returned with symptoms subsequently confirmed as PKDL, diagnosed from clinical history, appearance consistent with PKDL, and slit-skin smear examination. The median time to development of PKDL was 1. 2 ( 0. 8–2. 2 ) years following treatment. Comparison of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the VL patients treated with Ambisome who later developed PKDL, with those of the remaining cohort did not identify any significant risk factors for PKDL. However, the time to developing PKDL was significantly shorter with Ambisome than in a subset of patients presenting to the programme with PKDL following previous sodium stibogluconate treatment for VL.
Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease, reinfested sites in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in October 1992. We show how continuous- and discrete-time models fitted to patch-level infestation states can elucidate different aspects of re-establishment. Different methods of estimating the probabilities of bug establishment on each site were compared. The results confirmed a 6-month time lag between detection of a new infestation and dispersal events. The analysis showed that more new bug populations become established from May to November than from November to May. This seasonal increase in bug establishment coincides with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. In the fitted models, the probability of new bug establishment increases with increasing time since last detected infestation. These effects of season and previous infestation on bug establishment challenge our current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight important gaps in knowledge. We address three aspects relevant for population control of T. infestans that were not addressed previously: ( i ) the establishment rate of new local populations as a function of distance from existing local populations, ( ii ) possible mechanisms for the observed seasonality in bug establishment, and ( iii ) the effect of insecticide spraying and previous infestation on establishment rates.
Polyomavirus SV40 causes persistent infections in Syrian golden hamsters with a broad tissue tropism, infecting the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. In this study, we investigated the effects of SV40 microRNA ( miRNA ) on the pathogenesis of SV40 infections in vivo. We inoculated outbred young adult hamsters with 1×107 plaque-forming units of four different SV40 variants by the intracardiac route and determined viral DNA loads in different tissues from 3 to 270 days postinfection. We found that all SV40 strains displayed frequent establishment of persistent infections and slow viral clearance. Expression of SV40 miRNA was demonstrated in wild-type SV40-infected tissues, and miRNA-negative mutant viruses consistently produced higher viral DNA loads than wild-type SV40 in both liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regulatory regions displayed modestly higher viral DNA loads in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions. Early viral transcripts were detected at higher levels than late transcripts in liver and kidney. Infectious virus was detected infrequently, and there was limited evidence of increased clearance of miRNA-deficient viruses. We also found that wild-type and miRNA-negative mutants of SV40 showed similar rates of transformation of mouse cells in vitro and tumor induction in weanling hamsters in vivo. This study provides the first evidence of expression and function of SV40 miRNA in vivo and demonstrates that SV40 miRNA dampens viral DNA levels in tissues infected by SV40 strains with simple or complex regulatory regions.
Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes ( PSGs ) in mammals have been limited by small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of ∼16, 500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection ( FDR<0. 05 ), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible “selection histories” of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes.
Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes the skin and mucosal surfaces of mammals. It often causes persistent infections that involve biofilms, which are surface-associated communities of bacteria. Here we report the discovery of a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity. Biochemical and genetic analysis has revealed that these fibers have amyloid-like properties and consist of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins ( PSMs ). PSMs are known to be involved in biofilm disassembly, but we have found that when they aggregate into amyloid-like fibers, they do not disperse biofilms. Instead, they contribute to biofilm stability. This suggests that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms. We have demonstrated that PSMs are capable of self-assembling into amyloid-like fibers in vitro, and that these fibers share morphological and biophysical characteristics with known amyloid proteins. Our findings suggest that PSMs can modulate biofilm disassembly using amyloid-like aggregation as a control point for their activity. This is the first report to identify and characterize extracellular fimbriae in S. aureus biofilms.
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T. cruzi ), affects over 6 million individuals in more than 20 countries worldwide. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is crucial for developing and evaluating treatments to control the disease. However, routine screening for infected individuals is achieved by serological assays, and PCR testing to monitor spontaneous or therapy-induced parasitological cure has limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in circulating blood. To overcome these limitations, we evaluated a newly developed antibody profiling assay as an indirect method to assess parasite persistence based on the waning of antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection. We designed a multiplex serology assay, an array of 15 optimized T. cruzi antigens, to evaluate antibody diversity in 1654 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One specific antibody response, antibody 3 ( Ab3 ), showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by T. cruzi PCR positive results. Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. We hypothesize that Ab3 is induced and maintained by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based and shed parasites that are not consistently detectable by blood-based PCR techniques.
Chikungunya virus ( CHIKV ) is an arthritogenic alphavirus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain, with chronic musculoskeletal pain persisting in a substantial fraction of patients for months to years after the initial infection. To identify the cells that might contribute to pathogenesis during this chronic phase, we developed a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase ( CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre ). CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts, and it induced arthritis during the acute phase in mice. Importantly, it also induced chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis similar to wild-type virus. CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre infection of tdTomato reporter mice resulted in a population of tdTomato+ cells that persisted for at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometric profiling revealed that these tdTomato+ cells predominantly were myofibers and dermal and muscle fibroblasts. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a recently defined host receptor for CHIKV, reduced the number of tdTomato+ cells in the chronic phase and diminished the levels of chronic viral RNA, implicating these tdTomato+ cells as the reservoir of chronic viral RNA. Finally, isolation and flow cytometry-based sorting of the tdTomato+ fibroblasts from the skin and ankle and analysis for viral RNA revealed that the tdTomato+ cells harbor most of the persistent CHIKV RNA at chronic time points.
Dimensionality reduction methods are widely used to understand the multi-dimensional structure of neural population activity and its relation to brain function. However, it is unclear how the results obtained from these methods generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials or how they relate to the underlying network structure. To address these questions, we applied factor analysis ( FA ) to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models that self-generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. We compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction—shared dimensionality and percent shared variance—with neuron and trial count. We found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. Furthermore, recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure.
Bacterial quorum sensing ( QS ) signals are known to play a role in immunomodulation, but it is unclear whether microbes utilize these signals to maintain infection. Here, we show that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa QS-regulated molecule 2-amino acetophenone ( 2-AA ) modulates host immune responses in a manner that increases host ability to cope with this pathogen. Mice treated with 2-AA prior to infection had a 90% survival rate compared to 10% survival rate observed in non-pretreated infected mice. 2-AA stimulation activates key innate immune response pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ), nuclear factor ( NF ) -κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuates immune response activation upon pretreatment, most likely by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. 2-AA host pretreatment is characterized by a transcriptionally regulated block of c-JUN N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) and NF-κB activation, with relatively preserved activation of extracellular regulated kinase ( ERK ) 1/2. These kinase changes lead to CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β ( c/EBPβ ) activation and formation of the c/EBPβ-p65 complex that prevents NF-κB activation. Our results reveal a QS immunomodulatory signal that promotes original aspects of interkingdom communication. We propose that this communication facilitates pathogen persistence, while enabling host tolerance to infection.
L1TD1 is the only known domesticated gene whose protein-coding sequence is almost entirely derived from a LINE-1 ( L1 ) retroelement. We find that L1TD1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. We also find that L1TD1 has evolved under positive selection during primate and mouse evolution, and that one prosimian L1TD1 has ‘replenished’ itself with a more recent L1 ORF1 from the prosimian genome. These data suggest that L1TD1 has been recurrently selected for functional novelty, perhaps for a role in genome defense. L1TD1 loss is associated with L1 extinction in several megabat lineages, but not in sigmodontine rodents. We hypothesize that L1TD1 could have originally evolved for genome defense against L1 elements. Later, L1TD1 may have become incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. Our study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology, and that such domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages.
YbeY is an essential endoribonuclease in Vibrio cholerae that plays a critical role in virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome quality control. In contrast to Escherichia coli, where YbeY is not essential, YbeY is required for 16 S rRNA 3′ end maturation in V. cholerae and is part of a core set of RNases essential in most representative pathogens. Depletion of YbeY in V. cholerae leads to accumulation of 16 S rRNA precursors and free ribosomal subunits, and impairs subunit assembly into 70 S ribosomes. YbeY's importance to V. cholerae pathogenesis was demonstrated by the complete loss of mice colonization and biofilm formation, reduced cholera toxin production, and altered expression levels of virulence-associated small RNAs in a V. cholerae strain partially depleted for YbeY. Notably, the ybeY genes of several distantly related pathogens can fully complement an E. coli ΔybeY strain under various stress conditions, demonstrating the high conservation of YbeY's activity in stress regulation.
Transcription factor networks ( TFNs ) play a crucial role in the spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression. The robustness of a TFN's gene expression phenotype to genetic and environmental perturbation has been linked to several topological properties, including the degree distribution. Another important property is assortativity, which measures the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect. We know little about how a TFN's assortativity signature affects the robustness of its gene expression phenotype to perturbation. Here, we use publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. We find that all TFNs share a common assortativity signature and that this signature confers phenotypic robustness to model TFNs. We also determine the extent to which each of the four components of the assortativity signature contributes to this robustness. Theoretical work has shown that TFN models with increased assortativity exhibit increased robustness to both mutation in cis-regulatory sites and to gene duplication. Our results suggest that degree assortativity provides an additional structural source of robustness in biological networks, and that human TFNs share an assortativity signature that confers such robustness.
Inhibitory interneurons ( INH ) in the rat somatosensory barrel cortex provide more stimulus-related information than excitatory neurons ( EXC ) in response to whisker stimuli varying in location and frequency. Using large-scale multi-electrode arrays, we simultaneously recorded the activity of up to 74 neurons in all layers of 3–4 neighboring cortical columns in anesthetized adult rats. We found that individual INH neurons discriminate better between restricted sets of stimuli than EXC neurons in granular and infra-granular layers. Furthermore, ensembles of INH cells jointly provide as much information about such stimuli as comparable ensembles containing the ~20% most informative EXC neurons, but with less information redundancy. This suggests that INH neurons dominate the information conveyed to the neocortical network, thereby efficiently processing incoming sensory activity.
Synthetic biology aims to reprogram living cells like computers to perform new functions for a variety of applications. In this work, we report the engineering of a fundamental arithmetic logic unit based on de novo riboregulation to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations. Our designer circuit robustly performs the intended computation in a living cell encoding the result as fluorescence amplitudes. The system exploits post-transcriptional control to switch on tightly silenced genes with small RNAs, together with allosteric transcription factors to sense the molecular signals. This important result demonstrates that regulatory RNAs can be key players in synthetic biology, and it paves the way for engineering more complex RNA-based biocomputers using this designer circuit as a building block. We have programmed a bacterial cell so that it can perform the binary sum of two bits of information, encoded into the concentrations of IPTG and aTc ( signal molecules ). The bacterial cell reports the sum of this computation as red fluorescence and the carry as green fluorescence, a sort of minimal biocomputer.
Cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase II ( cN-II ) catalyzes the dephosphorylation of 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5′-monophosphates to regulate intracellular nucleotide pools. High levels of cN-II expression have been correlated with poor patient outcomes in cancer therapy. To investigate the role of cN-II in resistance to cytotoxic nucleoside analogues, we screened ribonucleoside phosphonates as potential cN-II inhibitors. Phosphonates incorporate a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of the labile phosphoester bond found in natural nucleoside 5′-monophosphates. Among 34 phosphonate analogues, six were predicted to be better ligands than the natural substrate, inosine 5′-monophosphate ( IMP ). These analogues were shown to induce a total inhibition of cN-II activity at 2 mM. The binding strength of these compounds was explained by an impressive number of van der Waals contacts with three cN-II residues: Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. The phosphonate bond was found to be crucial for the inhibition of cN-II activity, and the introduction of chemical modifications within the phosphonate chain allowed us to define general rules governing the theoretical affinity of these ligands.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy ( TSE ) is a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases, including scrapie in small ruminants. Prion infectivity had never been reported in milk from TSE-affected ruminant flocks. However, a recent study reported the presence of prions in mammary secretions from scrapie-affected ewes. Here, we report the detection of consistent levels of infectivity in colostrum and milk from sheep incubating natural scrapie, several months prior to clinical onset. Prion protein ( PrPSc ) was detected in lacteal ducts and mammary acini by immunohistochemistry and PET blot. PrPSc accumulation was detected only in ewes harbouring mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles that developed consequent to Maedi lentivirus infection. However, bioassay revealed that prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum, not only from ewes with such lympho-proliferative chronic mastitis, but also from those displaying lesion-free mammary glands. In milk and colostrum, infectivity could be recovered in the cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions. Using a Tg 338 mouse model, the highest per ml infectious titre measured was found to be equivalent to that contained in 6 µg of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. These findings indicate that both colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to the animal TSE transmission process, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs.
During the 2014–2015 Ebola virus disease ( EVD ) outbreak in Liberia, a total of 16, 370 laboratory samples were tested between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015. Of these, 10, 536 individuals were identified, of whom 3, 897 were confirmed EVD cases ( positive for Ebola virus RNA ). There were significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Young children and the elderly, as well as individuals living in rural areas, were identified as risk factors for death due to the disease. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. These findings may inform future investigations and contribute to a fuller understanding of the outbreak in Liberia.
Tyrosinase ( EC 1. 14. 18. 1 ) is a copper-containing monooxygenase that catalyzes the conversion of phenol to the corresponding ortho-quinone. In the present study, the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase toward the Tyr98 residue in the caddie protein has been elucidated. The caddie protein facilitates the transport of two copper ions into the active center of tyrosinase, and the Tyr98 residue is converted to a reactive quinone through the formations of the μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper ( II ) and Cu ( II ) -dopasemiquinone intermediates. Crystallographic analysis of cryo-trapped structures at very high resolutions ( 1. 16–1. 70 Å ) suggests that the hydroxylation reaction is triggered by the movement of CuA, which induces the syn-to-anti rearrangement of the copper ligands after the formation of the μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper ( II ) core. This rearrangement places the hydroxyl group of the substrate in an equatorial position, allowing the electrophilic attack to the aromatic ring by the Cu2O2 oxidant. The resulting deoxy form may interact with the dopaquinone residue more weakly than the deoxy2 form, inducing the release of the quinone-containing caddie protein.
Ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotic cells is a complex process involving the assembly of ribosomal subunits. The early steps of this process, particularly the formation of the first pre-60S particle, are poorly understood. The first pre-60S particle contains 30 assembly factors ( AFs ), including 8 RNA helicases. One of these helicases, Dbp6p, is essential for the normal accumulation of the first pre-60S pre-ribosomal particle in yeast. We show that Dbp6p associates with a complex of four AFs, namely Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p and Rsa3p, prior to their incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosomal particles. Npa1p forms the backbone of this complex and is essential for the stable integration of Dbp6p within the initial 90S pre-ribosomal particle. We demonstrate that Npa1p and Npa2p directly bind Dbp6p and that Npa1p is essential for the insertion of Dbp6p within 90S pre-ribosomal particles. We also show that Npa1p cross-links to 25S rRNA adjacent to the root helices of the first and last secondary structure domains of 25S rRNA and to snoRNAs involved in decoding center and peptidyl transferase center modifications. Our data suggest that the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions.
Catecholaminergic Regulation of Learning Rate in a Dynamic Environment: A Novel Role for the Human Catecholamine Systems in Learning Rate Regulation. Here, we report evidence from a study employing pharmacology, scalp electrophysiology and computational modeling that suggests an important role for catecholamines in learning rate regulation. We found that the P3 component of the EEG—an electrophysiological index of outcome-evoked phasic catecholamine release in the cortex—predicted learning rate, and formally mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning rate. P3 amplitude also mediated the effects of two computational variables—capturing the unexpectedness of an outcome and the uncertainty of a preexisting belief—on learning rate. Furthermore, a pharmacological manipulation of catecholamine activity affected learning rate following unanticipated task changes, in a way that depended on participants’ baseline learning rate. Our findings provide converging evidence for a causal role of the human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change.
Infectious diseases are a major challenge for humanity, and their surveillance is critical. In Senegal, two Point-Of-Care ( POC ) laboratories were established in the rural Saloum region from 2010 to 2016. In parallel, a homemade syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data produced by the POC laboratory of the Timone hospital in Marseille, France. The aim of this study was to describe the steps necessary for implementing EPIMIC using data routinely produced by two POC laboratories established in rural Senegal villages. After improving EPIMIC, we started to monitor the 15 pathogens routinely diagnosed in the two POC-L using the same methodology we used in France. In 5 years, 2, 577 deduplicated patients-samples couples from 775 different patients have been tested in the Dielmo and Ndiop POC-L. 739 deduplicated patients-samples couples were found to be positive to at least one of the tested pathogens. The retrospective analysis of the Dielmo and Ndiop POC data with EPIMIC allowed to generate 443 alarms. Since January 2016, 316 deduplicated patients-samples couples collected from 298 different patients were processed in the Niakhar POC laboratory. 56 deduplicated patients-samples couples were found to be positive to at least one of the tested pathogens. The retrospective analysis of the data of the Niakhar POC laboratory with EPIMIC allowed to generate 14 alarms. Although some improvements are still needed, EPIMIC has been successfully spread using data routinely produced by two rural POC-L in Senegal, West Africa.
Collective calcium signaling and cell contractility in endothelial cells depend on the structural arrangement of the cells. Using a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning, we investigated the effects of cellular architecture on histamine-induced calcium signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC ). Histamine treatment induced a rapid increase followed by a slow decay of cytosolic calcium concentration in individual cells and monolayers. However, in self-assembled capillary-like networks and plasma lithography microengineered cell networks, histamine induced calcium oscillations that were not observed in individual cells and monolayers. The occurrence of calcium oscillations depended on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication, as revealed by micropatterning, pharmacological inhibition, and computational modeling. Furthermore, the calcium oscillation attenuated the histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential cell responses in an architecture-dependent manner. Our results suggest that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling.
Respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) is the major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. We previously elucidated the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection in infants using whole genome-fragment phage display libraries ( GFPDL ) expressing linear and conformational epitopes from RSV. The G-reactive epitopes spanned the N- and C-termini of G ectodomain, in addition to the central conserved domain ( CCD ). In the current study, we examined the contribution of antigenic regions of G outside of the CCD to RSV-specific immunity. We evaluated the immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy of all RSV-G antigenic sites identified following primary RSV infection using recombinant E. coli expressed G ectodomain ( REG ), CCD-deleted G ectodomain ( REG ΔCCD ), N- and C-terminal G subdomains, and antigenic site peptides. We found that REG ΔCCD, N- and C-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound fully glycosylated Recombinant Mammalian expressed G ectodomain ( RMG ) and intact RSV virion particles, but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared with the intact G ectodomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A2 Line 19F, and viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was significantly reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmunized controls.
In the developing Drosophila nervous system, the specification of neuropeptidergic neurons, such as the Tv4 neurons of the ventral nerve cord, is controlled by a combination of intrinsic transcriptional cascades and target-derived signals. One such target-derived signal is the bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) signal, which acts as the final trigger to activate the FMRFa gene in Tv4 neurons. A recent genetic screen identified several genes involved in Tv4 specification, two of which encode components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome: brr2 and Prp8. We found that brr2 and Prp8 play crucial roles in controlling the expression of the FMRFa neuropeptide specifically in six neurons of the VNC ( Tv4 neurons ). Detailed analysis of brr2 revealed that this control is executed by two independent mechanisms, both of which are required for the activation of the BMP retrograde signaling pathway in Tv4 neurons: ( 1 ) proper axonal pathfinding to the target tissue in order to receive the BMP ligand, and ( 2 ) proper RNA splicing of two genes in the BMP pathway: the thickveins ( tkv ) gene, encoding a BMP receptor subunit, and the Medea gene, encoding a co-Smad. These results reveal involvement of specific RNA processing in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.
Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases ( CRLs ) are the largest class of E3 ubiquitin ligases, and their substrate receptor subunits are tightly regulated to maintain the full repertoire of CRLs. In yeast, we describe a novel pathway for regulation of F-box protein abundance that is independent of the central SCF component Skp1. This pathway targets F-box proteins that are dissociated from Skp1 and involves the SCF core components Cdc53 and Rbx1, as well as the cognate SCF ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34. Importantly, this ubiquitylation pathway does not require Skp1 ( Skp1-independent Cul1-dependent ubiquitylation ) and suggests a function of Cdc53/Cul1 that is independent from association with Skp1. We demonstrate that this non-canonical degradation pathway is critical for chromosome stability and effective defense against heavy metal stress. We describe this pathway in detail for Met30, the substrate adaptor for SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase, which negatively regulates transcription factor Met4 by proteolysis-independent ubiquitylation. Our results assign important biological functions to a sub-complex of cullin-RING ligases that comprises Cdc53/Rbx1/Cdc34, but is independent of Skp1.
Kinesin-3 motors drive the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, kinesin motors are kept inactive to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis and motility. Current models suggest that the Kinesin-3 motor KIF1A is monomeric in the inactive state and that activation results from concentration-driven dimerization on the cargo membrane. However, we show that both native and expressed KIF1A proteins are dimeric in the inactive state. Thus, KIF1A motors are not activated by cargo-induced dimerization. Instead, we show that KIF1A motors are autoinhibited by two distinct inhibitory mechanisms. Successive truncations result in monomeric and dimeric motors that can undergo one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice. However, only dimeric motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. Thus, KIF1A may be uniquely suited to use both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells. We show that the motility of dimeric KIF1A motors is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtubules and occurs with an average velocity comparable to vesicles moving in vivo.
Metabolite profiling and network analysis were applied to a collection of 76 tomato introgression lines ( ILs ) to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism and to estimate the degree of metabolic natural variability. The results showed that amino acid contents displayed a high degree of variability across the population, while sugars exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci ( mQTL ). The main factor for metabolic polymorphism was found to be the genotypic background rather than the environment or the tissue. Analysis of the coefficient of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in the ILs than in the M82 tomato cultivar. Broad-sense estimate of heritability suggested that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in the seed differed from that in the fruit. Correlation-based metabolic network analysis comparing metabolite data for the seed with that for the pericarp showed that the seed network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes than the fruit. Amino acids in the seed metabolic network were shown to play a central hub-like role in the topology of the network, maintaining high interactions with other metabolite categories. Network analysis identified six exceptionally highly co-regulated amino acids: Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro. These results reflect the extensive redundancy of the regulation underlying seed metabolism, demonstrate the tight co-ordination of seed metabolism with respect to fruit metabolism, and emphasize the centrality of the amino acid module in the seed metabolic network.
Vibrio cholerae is a pathogenic bacterium that colonizes the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton as well as the human gastrointestinal tract. The N-acetylglucosamine binding protein ( GbpA ) is responsible for mediating bacterial attachment to both marine chitin and mammalian intestinal mucin. We report that GbpA possesses an unusual, elongated four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. A glycan screen revealed that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides. Structure-guided GbpA truncation mutants show that domains 1 and 4 of GbpA interact with chitin in vitro, whereas in vivo complementation studies reveal that domain 1 is also crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Bacterial binding studies show that domains 2 and 3 bind to the V. cholerae surface. Finally, mouse virulence assays show that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization. These results explain how GbpA provides structural/functional modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium and chitinous exoskeletons.
Circulating HLA-DR+CD4+ effector memory T cells resistant to CCR5 and PD-L1 mediated suppression compromise regulatory T cell function in pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ). In PTB, chronic T cell activation is a hallmark of the disease, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly elucidated. Our study shows that circulating natural regulatory T cells ( Treg ) in adults with PTB preserve their suppressive potential, but T effector cells ( Teff ) from such subjects are resistant to Treg-mediated suppression. This resistance is due to the expansion of an activated Teff subset identified by Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -DR expression. We found that Teff cells containing HLA-DR+ cells are resistant to Treg suppression mediated via CCR5 and PD-L1 associated pathways. In addition, HLA-DR+ Teff cells expressed significantly higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines that may regulate Treg function through a reciprocal counter-balancing relationship. Our study provides novel insight on how activated HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells may contribute to disease associated inflammation by compromising Treg-mediated suppression in PTB.
Prions are infectious proteins that cause fatal neurodegenerative diseases in animals. Prions are composed of a host protein, PrPC, which is linked to the cell membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor. In this study, we investigated whether mice expressing PrPC devoid of the GPI anchor ( tgGPI− mice ) could faithfully propagate prion strains despite the deviant structure and location of anchorless PrPSc. We found that RML and ME7 prions, but not 22L prions, propagated in tgGPI− mice developed novel cell tropisms, as determined by the Cell Panel Assay ( CPA ). Surprisingly, the levels of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc ( PrPres ) in RML- or ME7-infected tgGPI− brain were 25–50 times higher than in wild-type brain. When returned to wild-type brain, ME7 prions recovered their original properties, however RML prions had given rise to a novel prion strain, designated SFL, which remained unchanged even after three passages in wild-type mice. Because both RML PrPSc and SFL PrPSc are stably propagated in wild-type mice, we propose that the two conformations are separated by a high activation energy barrier which is abrogated in tgGPI− mice.
The BMP signaling pathway has a conserved role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development. In Drosophila, graded BMP signaling is transduced by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. In this study, we combine RNA-seq with Mad and Brinker ChIP-seq to decipher the BMP-responsive transcriptional network underpinning differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm during dorsal-ventral axis patterning. We identify multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. Manipulation of EGF signaling levels by loss- and gain-of-function studies reveals that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription. Therefore, the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property in that it establishes a balance between its activity and that of the antagonistic EGF signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning. In terms of BMP-dependent transcription, we identify key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain, and find widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator protein shows reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, the fate specified by peak BMP signaling.
Leishmania major, the parasite responsible for zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis ( ZCL ), is spreading in Tunisia from the south-west to new areas in the center of the country. To understand the evolution and population dynamics of L. major in Tunisia, we performed multi-locus microsatellite typing of human isolates from three endemic governorates ( Gafsa, Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid ) collected during two periods: 1991–1992 and 2008–2012. Our results show that over two decades, L. major populations evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations in the same area. The genetic patterns of 2008–2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia according to a geographical gradient, suggesting that human activities might be the source of the disease expansion. The genotype analysis also suggests previous and current flows of genotypes between governorates and districts. Our study provides new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia that might improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
Helminth infections are common among HIV-infected adults in Kenya, with approximately 22% of the 701 stool samples provided being helminth-infected, mostly of low to moderate intensity. We conducted a cohort study nested within a randomized trial of empiric deworming of HIV-infected adults in Kenya to evaluate the impact of different potential helminth protective packages on infection prevalence, including repeated treatment with albendazole and praziquantel with and without water, sanitation, and hygiene ( WASH ) access. The odds of infection with any soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) species were lower for individuals who were treated with albendazole ( aOR:0. 11, 95%CI: 0. 05, 0. 20, p<0. 001 ), adjusting for age and sex. Although most WASH conditions demonstrated minimal additional benefit in reducing the probability of infection with any STH species, access to safe flooring did appear to offer some additional protection ( aOR:0. 34, 95%CI: 0. 20, 0. 56, p<0. 001 ). For schistosomiasis, only treatment with praziquantel was protective ( aOR:0. 30, 95%CI: 0. 14, 0. 60, p = 0. 001 ). Amongst individuals who were not treated with albendazole or praziquantel, the most protective intervention package to reduce probability of STH infections included safe flooring ( aOR:0. 34, 95%CI: 0. 20, 0. 59, p<0. 001 ) and latrine access ( aOR:0. 59, 95%CI: 0. 35, 0. 99, p = 0. 05 ).
LlpA is a lectin-like bacteriocin produced by several plant-associated bacteria, including Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas species. The crystal structure of LlpABW, the prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, reveals an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin ( MMBL ) domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal MMBL domain ( C-domain ) adopts a fold similar to MMBL domains from plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose and oligomannosides. Mutational analysis indicates that an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal MMBL domain ( N-domain ) adopts the same fold but is structurally more divergent and lacks a functional mannose-binding site. Differential activity of engineered N/C-domain chimeras derived from two LlpA homologues with different killing spectra discloses that the N-domain determines target specificity.
Bacillus subtilis is a Gram-positive bacterium that undergoes a complex developmental process called sporulation. During this process, the developing spore ( forespore ) resides within a mother cell, and the regulation of the forespore transcription factor σG has remained poorly understood. We show that σG activity requires eight mother-cell proteins encoded in the spoIIIA operon and the forespore protein SpoIIQ. One of the SpoIIIA proteins shares similarity with a secretion ATPase and we demonstrate that the ATPase motifs are required for σG activity. We further show that the SpoIIIA proteins and SpoIIQ reside in a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore. Importantly, we demonstrate that these proteins are all required to maintain forespore integrity. In their absence, the forespore develops large invaginations and collapses. These results support a model in which the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ proteins form a novel secretion apparatus that allows the mother cell to nurture the forespore, thereby maintaining forespore physiology and σG activity during spore maturation. We propose that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex forms a novel secretion apparatus that links the mother cell and forespore, cobbled together from components of specialized secretion systems found in Gram-negative bacteria.
Bipolar disorder ( BD ) is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder affecting approximately 1% of the world's population. It is characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression and is associated with a 17% risk of suicide. Despite its high heritability, BD has not yielded genetic loci from family and population based mapping strategies. We present a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) of 2, 191 cases and 1, 434 controls to identify genetic variants associated with BD. Although we do not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci, we show an association between the power to detect effects calculated from a previous GWAS and evidence for replication ( P = 1. 5×10−7 ). We demonstrate that this result is not likely to be a false positive by analyzing replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and show that associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, we show that SNPs near exons exhibit a greater probability of replication, supporting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. These results indicate that there is likely common genetic variation associated with BD near exons ( ±10 kb ) that could be identified in larger studies.
Cancerous and non-cancerous cells exhibit different proliferation mechanisms, and understanding these differences is crucial for the development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs. Here, we present the first genome-wide analysis of cancer proliferation based on gene expression and growth rate measurements of 12690 genes across 60 cancer cell lines ( the NCI-60 panel ). We assign each gene a Cancer Proliferation Index ( cPI ) that quantifies the association between its expression levels and growth rate measurements. Genes found essential in cancer gene knockdown screens exhibit significant positive cPI values, while tumor suppressors exhibit significant negative cPI values. We find that cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production related processes are positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration is negatively associated with it. A parallel analysis of genes' non-cancerous proliferation indices ( nPI ) across 224 lymphoblastoid cell lines reveals marked differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation. These differences highlight genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins. A cross species comparison reveals that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, while non-cancerous proliferation does not. Combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures leads to enhanced prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer.
Cystic echinococcosis ( CE ) is a parasitic disease that can affect the heart and vena cava, although such cases are rare. A 15-year retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular CE is reported. The main clinical manifestations included thoracic pain or dyspnea, although 2 patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava, and 9 patients were previously diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the primary diagnostic method, supplemented by serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging, and histology. Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery and 9 received long-term antiparasitic treatment for a median duration of 25 months. One patient died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination, and 2 patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. Patients with isolated cardiac CE did not have complications after surgery and were considered cured, while those with vena cava involvement developed pulmonary embolism and presented multiple complications. Cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications, and clinical manifestations and complications vary according to cyst location.
Staphylococcus aureus carries a TIR homologue called TirS that is part of a novel bacterial invasion mechanism. TirS modulates the host inflammatory response by inhibiting the Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) signaling pathway in eukaryotic cells, downregulating the NF-kB pathway through inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9. In a mouse model of skin infection, S. aureus strains lacking the tirS gene induced more severe skin lesions compared to wild-type and restored strains, despite similar bacterial loads. This suggests that TirS attenuates virulence through local inflammatory responses. TirS is associated with the staphylococcal chromosomal cassettes ( SCC ) containing the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance, and sub-inhibitory concentrations of fusidic acid increase tirS expression. Epidemiological studies found no link between TirS and clinical presentation, but identified a selective advantage with a SCCmec element carrying SCC fusC/tirS.
Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly) and Anopheles gambiae (malaria mosquito) are two species of Diptera (flies) that have distinct embryonic morphologies. We used whole-genome transcriptional datasets collected during embryonic development to search for differences in gene expression underlying these morphological differences. We found that many orthologous gene pairs could be clustered based on coincident discordances in their temporal expression profiles. One such cluster contained genes expressed specifically in the mosquito serosa, a tissue that is absent in fruit flies. This cluster is redeployed later in development at the time of cuticle synthesis. We also found a striking difference in the temporal expression of a subset of maternal genes. Specifically, maternal transcripts that exhibit a sharp reduction at the time of the maternal-zygotic transition in Drosophila display sustained expression in the Anopheles embryo. We propose that gene clustering by local temporal discordance can be used for the de novo identification of the gene batteries underlying morphological diversity.
Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue are major causes of leg ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific Region. A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural villages of Lihir Island, Papua New Guinea during a yaws elimination campaign to investigate the presence of DNA from these bacteria on asymptomatic people, flies, and household linens. Of 78 asymptomatic participants, H. ducreyi-PCR positivity was identified in 16 ( 21% ) and T. p. pertenue-PCR positivity in 1 ( 1% ). In subgroup analyses, H. ducreyi-PCR positivity did not differ in participants exposed or not exposed to a case of H. ducreyi ulcer in the household. Of 17 cultures obtained from asymptomatic participants, 2 ( 12% ) yielded a definitive diagnosis of H. ducreyi, proving skin colonization. Of 10 flies tested, 9 ( 90% ) had H. ducreyi DNA and 5 ( 50% ) had T. p. pertenue DNA. Of 6 bed sheets sampled, 2 ( 33% ) had H. ducreyi DNA and 1 ( 17% ) had T. p. pertenue DNA. This is the first time that H. ducreyi DNA and colonization has been demonstrated on the skin of asymptomatic children and that H. ducreyi DNA and T. p. pertenue DNA has been identified in flies and on fomites. The ubiquity of H. ducreyi in the environment is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism.
The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology ( ISCB ) Education Committee has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in the field of bioinformatics. These core competencies were developed based on surveys of employers and training programs, and have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. The core competencies are intended to cut across many user personas and training programs, and provide a basis for the community of bioinformatics educators to draw upon their common experiences in designing, refining, and evaluating their own training programs. The core competencies are not intended to be a prescription for a specific set of curricula or curricular standards, but rather a conceptual framework in which the field can more productively share experiences and pool efforts in identifying best practices for bioinformatics education in the face of divergent needs and expectations. A series of use cases are presented to illustrate the applications of the core competencies to different bioinformatics education and training programs globally. These use cases highlight a diverse set of training needs, user personas, types of training programs, and educational settings.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a parasitic nematode infecting over one billion people worldwide, has a unique life cycle that includes both parasitic and free-living forms. Unlike other parasitic nematodes, S. stercoralis has a developmentally arrested third-stage larva ( L3i ) that is similar to the dauer larva of the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We hypothesized that S. stercoralis homologs of C. elegans dauer genes are present, have similar developmental regulation, and are involved in L3i arrest and activation. To test this, we undertook a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome of S. stercoralis, generating over 2. 3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages. We constructed developmental expression profiles for S. stercoralis homologs of C. elegans dauer genes and found that genes encoding cGMP pathway components were coordinately up-regulated in L3i. In contrast to C. elegans, S. stercoralis has a paucity of genes encoding insulin/IGF-1-like signaling ( IIS ) ligands. We also identified seven S. stercoralis genes encoding homologs of the single C. elegans dauer regulatory TGFβ ligand, three of which are only expressed in L3i. Putative DA biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3i development. Our data suggest that while dauer pathway genes are present in S. stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species.
Bacterial genotoxins, such as Cytolethal Distending Toxin ( CDT ) and colibactin, induce the formation of transient messenger-rich ribonucleoprotein nuclear invaginations ( NR ) in surviving cells. These structures are characterized by the concentration of ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and the main components of the mCRD complex involved in mRNA turnover. They are active sites of mRNA translation, correlated with a high degree of ploidy, and involve MAPK and calcium signaling. These structures are dynamic, transient, and protect the cell until the genotoxic stress is relieved. Our results show that CDT and colibactin induce the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of giant cells, which correspond to nucleoplasmic reticulum ( NR ). The core of the NR concentrates proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, ribosomes, and the main subunits of the mCRD complex involved in mRNA turnover. These structures are active sites of mRNA translation and decay, and their formation has not been previously reported to occur during bacterial infections.
Leprosy is known to cause facial deformities not only due to a saddle nose but also due to regression of the maxilla. However, the extent of maxillary bone deformation in living patients with leprosy has been evaluated only by subjective visual grading. Here, we used three-dimensional computed tomography ( 3D-CT ) to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy. We reconstructed 3D images of the maxilla in 10 former patients with leprosy and 5 control subjects, and measured the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla ( MA-P ) after compensating for individual skull size. We found that 3 former patients with lepromatous leprosy showed marked atrophy of the maxilla at the prosthion, which corresponded with the visual appearance of the maxillary deformity. These results were consistent with paleopathological findings of excavated skeletal remains. We also found that the precise bone defects of the maxilla could be individually calculated for accurate reconstructive surgery. This study illustrates maxillary bone deformities in living patients with leprosy and confirms the maxillary regression described in paleopathological studies.
In the auditory system, one of the most important and poorly understood challenges is to identify behaviorally relevant sounds in the presence of background noise. Here, we investigated whether adaptation to stimulus statistics in the auditory system enables the brain to build noise-invariant representations of sounds. We measured neural responses to complex sounds embedded in stationary noise by recording from single units and small multi-unit clusters in the auditory midbrain and cortex and by simulating responses in the auditory periphery. We find a progressive increase in the noise tolerance of population representations of sound. Moreover, neuron-level changes in the strength of adaptation and population-level changes in the noise tolerance of decoding are well correlated both within and across auditory centers. This suggests that adaptation to stimulus statistics may indeed be a neural mechanism that drives the construction of noise-tolerant representations of sound. As one progresses through the auditory pathway, neural responses become progressively more independent of the level of background noise. By the level of the cortex, neural populations represent the signal in a more noise-tolerant fashion, by responding to the sound features that are common between clean and noisy conditions.
The yeast protein-protein interaction network, also known as the interactome, undergoes significant changes in response to heat shock, a well-characterized form of cellular stress. We calculated the weight of each protein-protein interaction in both unstressed and heat shocked yeast cells, using the physical protein-protein interaction subset of the BioGRID database. Our results show that heat shock induces a significant decrease in both the overlaps and connections of yeast interactome modules, resulting in a 4. 9-fold increase in the weighted diameter of the yeast interactome. This change resembles a ‘stratus-cumulus’ type transition of the interactome structure, where the unstressed interactome has a globally connected organization, similar to that of stratus clouds, and the heat shocked interactome has a multifocal organization, similar to that of cumulus clouds. Several key proteins of the heat shock response become centers of heat shock-induced local communities, as well as bridges providing a residual connection of modules after heat shock. Our results suggest that heat shock induces a partial disintegration of the global organization of the yeast interactome, which may be a general adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
Chagas disease is a neglected chronic condition caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, with a high prevalence and burden in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, and amiodarone has been widely used for this purpose. We conducted a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the effect of amiodarone in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS up to January 2018 and included 9 studies ( 3 before-after studies, 5 case series and 1 randomized controlled trial ). Two studies with a total of 38 patients had the full dataset, allowing individual patient data analysis. We found that amiodarone reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes in 99. 9% ( 95%CI 99. 8%-100% ), ventricular premature beats in 93. 1% ( 95%CI 82%-97. 4% ) and the incidence of ventricular couplets in 79% ( RR 0. 21, 95%CI 0. 11–0. 39 ). We also found that amiodarone was associated with corneal microdeposits ( 61. 1%, 95%CI 19. 0–91. 3, 5 studies ), gastrointestinal events ( 16. 1%, 95%CI 6. 61–34. 2, 3 studies ), sinus bradycardia ( 12. 7%, 95%CI 3. 71–35. 5, 6 studies ), dermatological events ( 10. 6%, 95%CI 4. 77–21. 9, 3 studies ) and drug discontinuation ( 7. 68%, 95%CI 4. 17–13. 7, 5 studies ).
Dengue fever is an infectious disease spread by mosquitoes that exhibits seasonal patterns, which are driven by a combination of climatic and environmental factors, as well as human behavioral time trends. In this study, we used data from patients diagnosed with dengue fever at two hospitals in rural Ecuador from 2009 to 2016 to determine the short- and long-term seasonal patterns of the disease, as well as the effect of day of the week, public holidays, and school schedules on dengue fever diagnoses. We used Poisson generalized linear modeling to analyze the data and found that the most important predictors of dengue fever were annual sinusoidal fluctuations in disease, long-term trends, day of the week, and hospital. We found that dengue fever cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less likely to be diagnosed on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors of dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas. We also found that school schedules did not impact dengue diagnoses in school-aged children. In a separate model, we examined the effect of climate on diagnosis patterns and found that important climate variables included monthly total precipitation, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly absolute minimum temperature, an interaction between total precipitation and monthly precipitation days, and a three-way interaction between minimum temperature, total precipitation, and precipitation days. These results can inform local disease prevention efforts, public health planning, as well as global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
Transgenic expression of a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( RdRP ), in the absence of other viral proteins, profoundly reconfigures mammalian innate antiviral immunity by exposing the normally membrane-sequestered RdRP activity to sustained innate immune detection. RdRP-transgenic mice have a life-long, quantitatively dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes ( ISGs ) and show profound resistance to normally lethal viral challenge. The mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS and is fully independent of the adaptive immune system. Importantly, despite lifelong massive ISG elevations, RdRP mice are entirely healthy, with normal longevity. Our data reveal that a powerfully augmented MDA5-mediated activation state can be a well-tolerated mammalian innate immune system configuration. These results provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection. RdRP mice possess a maximally upregulated innate immune transcriptome capable of effecting a robust antiviral response, far exceeding the innate immune gene inductions produced by virus infection itself. The resulting activation of cell-intrinsic innate immunity culminates in production of type I interferons ( IFNs ) and activation of a large class of potent antiviral factors collectively termed IFN-stimulated genes ( ISGs ).
Effective population size ( Ne ) determines the strength of genetic drift and the frequency of co-infection by multiple genotypes, making it a key factor in viral evolution. The independent action hypothesis ( IAH ) states that each virion has a probability of infection, and that virions act independent of one another during the infection process. A corollary of IAH is that Ne must be dose dependent. Here, we test the IAH using Tobacco etch virus ( TEV ) variants carrying fluorescent markers in Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants. The number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose, and was similar to a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary infection foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency ( <2% ). The probability that a genotype that infected the inoculated leaf would systemically infect that plant was near 1. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted from the mean number of primary infection foci using the independent-action model. Independent action appears to hold for TEV, and Ne is therefore dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The mean number of virions causing systemic infection can be very small, and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose-dependency in TEV suggests that comparison of Ne estimates for different viruses are not very meaningful unless dose effects are taken into consideration.
In this study, we propose a new statistical framework for mapping expression quantitative trait loci ( eQTLs ) across multiple tissues using a Bayesian multi-tissue approach. We show that this approach is more powerful than traditional methods in revealing the true complexity of the eQTL landscape at the systems level. We demonstrate this by testing our method on a set of 2, 000 genes in four tissues and show that it is more powerful than traditional approaches in revealing the true complexity of the eQTL landscape at the systems level. We identify a two-eQTL model ( cis/trans ) for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and was not detected by conventional approaches. We also show common genetic regulation of gene expression across four tissues for ∼27% of transcripts, providing >5 fold increase in eQTLs detection when compared with single tissue analyses at 5% false discovery rate ( FDR ) level. We show that our method can identify substantially more cis- and trans-effects than commonly used single marker eQTL methods for the same FDR level, and that it permits efficient identification of genetic regulation across multiple tissue types. We also show that our Bayesian variable selection approach provides a best visited model with a list of eQTLs and addresses the inherent uncertainty in finding best predictor subsets.
Cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand ( TRAIL ) enter a protracted period of variable duration in which only upstream initiator caspases are active, followed by a sudden transition to activation of downstream effector caspases that rapidly dismantle the cell. This unusual variable-delay, snap-action switch enforces an unambiguous choice between life and death. To understand how the extrinsic apoptosis switch functions in quantitative terms, we constructed a mathematical model based on a mass-action representation of known reaction pathways. The model was trained against experimental data obtained by live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting of cells perturbed by protein depletion and overexpression. The trained model accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. We find that the duration of the delay prior to effector caspase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and the rates of other reactions lying immediately downstream of the TRAIL receptor. Sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved downstream by reactions involved in permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and relocalization of proteins such as Smac. The pattern of interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are all critical for snap-action control.
Listeria monocytogenes is a food-borne pathogen capable of crossing the feto-maternal barrier and infecting the placenta. We previously identified the L. monocytogenes protein Internalin P ( InlP ) as a secreted virulence factor critical for placental infection. Here, we show that InlP binds to human afadin, a protein associated with cell-cell junctions, and that this interaction enhances L. monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers. InlP contains an extended leucine-rich repeat ( LRR ) domain with a distinctive Ca2+-binding site, and a crystal structure of InlP reveals several unique features. L. monocytogenes ΔinlP mutants were deficient in their ability to form actin-rich protrusions from the basal face of polarized epithelial monolayers, a necessary step in crossing such monolayers. A similar phenotype was observed for bacteria expressing an internal in-frame deletion in inlP ( inlP ΔLRR5 ) that specifically disrupts its interaction with afadin. We conclude that secreted InlP targets cytosolic afadin to specifically promote L. monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection.
Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum is a spirochete bacterium that causes syphilis, a chronic multistage disease. The global proteome of T. pallidum ssp. pallidum has not been well characterized. To gain insights into pathogenicity and protein expression profiles during infection, we studied T. pallidum ssp. pallidum DAL-1 strain bacteria isolated from rabbits using complementary mass spectrometry techniques. A total of 6033 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique T. pallidum proteins at a high level of confidence, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date. A total of 116 potential membrane proteins were identified, of which 16 have evidence supporting outer membrane localization. We found 8/12 proteins related to the paralogous tpr gene family: TprB, TprC/D, TprE, TprG, TprH, TprI and TprJ. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free spectral counting methods. A low correlation ( r = 0. 26 ) was found between previous microarray signal data and protein abundance. These data provide valuable insights into in vivo T. pallidum protein expression, paving the way for improved understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.
Protein Kinase A ( PKA ) is the major receptor for the cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) secondary messenger in eukaryotes. cAMP binds to two tandem cAMP-binding domains ( CBD-A and -B ) within the regulatory subunit of PKA ( R ), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit ( C ). While CBD-A in RIα is required for PKA inhibition and activation, CBD-B functions as a “gatekeeper” domain that modulates the control exerted by CBD-A. Here, we investigate the two-domain construct RIα ( 91–379 ) in its apo, cAMP2, and C-bound forms by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ). Our results lead to a double conformational selection model in which each apo CBD dynamically samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD within a nearly degenerate free energy landscape. This degeneracy is critical to explain the sensitivity of CBD-B to weak interactions with C and its high affinity for cAMP. Binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, as it selectively stabilizes the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and W260. The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformational selection, but is indispensable for full activation of PKA as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A.
Interferon-stimulated gene 15 ( ISG15 ) is a protein that plays a role in antiviral immunity and is induced by interferon. In this study, we investigated the role of ISG15 in macrophages following vaccinia virus ( VACV ) infection. We compared the proteomes of ISG15 deficient ( ISG15-/- ) and ISG15 sufficient ( ISG15+/+ ) bone marrow derived macrophages ( BMDM ) after VACV infection. We found that ISG15-/- BMDM had altered mitochondrial function and oxidative phosphorylation ( OXPHOS ) compared to ISG15+/+ BMDM following interferon treatment. ISG15+/+ BMDM had higher mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) production, and reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production than ISG15-/- BMDM following interferon treatment. We also found that ISG15-/- macrophages were permissive for VACV replication following interferon treatment. In contrast, ISG15+/+ macrophages had higher nitric oxide ( NO ) production and lower viral titers than ISG15-/- macrophages following interferon treatment. Our results demonstrate that ISG15 regulates the dynamic functionality of mitochondria, specifically OXPHOS and mitophagy, and plays an important role in antiviral immunity.
Viral protein U ( Vpu ) is a multifunctional protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) that is involved in the degradation of the HIV-1 receptor CD4 and the enhancement of viral particle release. Vpu binds CD4 and recruits the βTrCP subunit of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its constitutively phosphorylated DS52GXXS56 motif. However, Vpu escapes degradation while inhibiting the degradation of βTrCP natural targets such as β-catenin and IκBα. We show that Vpu undergoes phosphorylation of the serine 61 residue, which lies adjacent to the βTrCP-binding motif, in cells arrested in early mitosis. This phosphorylation event triggers Vpu degradation by a βTrCP-independent process. Mutation of Vpu S61 in the HIV-1 provirus extends the half-life of the protein and significantly increases the release of HIV-1 particles from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant of regulated Vpu turnover is highly conserved within HIV-1 isolates. Our results highlight a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or as a substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. The conservation of the Vpu degradation determinant, despite its negative effect on virion release, argues for a role in overall HIV-1 fitness.
The development of correctly patterned tissues is a complex process that can occur under a wide range of conditions that alter the rate of development in the whole body. We propose that tissue patterning is coordinated with whole-body development to generate robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations. We developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae using the expression of canonical patterning genes, linking our scheme to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering and pupariation. We found that the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these key developmental events represent milestones. Between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. Furthermore, our data showed that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage. Thus, for wing disc patterning, wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone. Our findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones.
In polarised cells, such as fungal hyphae, early endosomes function in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargoes, including mRNA and protein complexes. Here, we demonstrate that the ESCRT regulator Did2 coordinates endosomal transport in fungal hyphae of Ustilago maydis. Loss of Did2 results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. Importantly, the late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, explaining the disturbed processive movement. Furthermore, the endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 is hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. In conclusion, the ESCRT regulator Did2 coordinates precise maturation of endosomes and thus provides the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport.
Riboswitches are ligand-binding elements in bacterial mRNAs that regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or translational level. Here, we report a comparative study between the adenine riboswitches of Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnificus, which differ in their regulatory mechanisms. While the B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch controls transcription and requires co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, the V. vulnificus add riboswitch regulates translation and can bind adenine after transcription is completed. Our results suggest that the rate of transcription is critical for the B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch to perform efficiently, consistent with a co-transcriptional regulation mechanism. In contrast, the V. vulnificus add riboswitch operates under a thermodynamic regime, where ligand binding and riboswitch regulation can occur post-transcriptionally, and transcription-translation coupling is not required for efficient regulation. We demonstrate that the add riboswitch can regulate translation even when transcription and translation are uncoupled, and that the riboswitch conformations are responsible for the adenine-dependent modulation of translation. Our results suggest that the nature of gene regulation control, that is transcription or translation, may have a high importance in riboswitch regulatory mechanisms.
Transcription initiation that involves the use of a 2- to ~4-nt oligoribonucleotide primer, known as primer-dependent initiation ( PDI ), has been shown to be prevalent at promoters of genes expressed during the stationary phase of growth in Escherichia coli. Here, we establish a physiological role for PDI in E. coli as a regulatory mechanism that modulates biofilm formation. Using high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5′ ends ( 5′ RNA-seq ), we further demonstrate that PDI occurs in the pathogenic bacterium Vibrio cholerae. A comparative global analysis of PDI in V. cholerae and E. coli reveals that the pattern of PDI is strikingly similar in the two organisms. In particular, PDI is detected in stationary phase, is not detected in exponential phase, and is preferentially apparent at promoters carrying the sequence T−1A+1 or G−1G+1 ( where position +1 corresponds to the position of de novo initiation ). We propose that PDI in both E. coli and V. cholerae occurs through a growth phase-dependent process that leads to the preferential generation of the linear dinucleotides 5′-UA-3′ and 5′-GG-3′.
Parental genome dosage imbalance has been shown to deregulate embryo growth in both mammals and plants, and is thought to be involved in reproductive isolation between emerging new species. In this study, we investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, which are genes that are expressed by a single parental allele. We tested the expression of four imprinted genes: FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED2 ( FIS2 ) and FLOWERING WAGENINGEN ( FWA ), which are controlled by DNA methylation, and MEDEA ( MEA ) and PHERES1 ( PHE1 ), which are controlled by histone methylation. We found that genome dosage imbalance deregulated the expression of FIS2 and PHE1 in an antagonistic manner. In addition, increased dosage of inactive alleles caused a loss of imprinting of FIS2 and MEA. Our results show that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting using mechanisms that are independent from known regulators of imprinting.
In this paper, we investigate the role of brain rhythms in revealing functional brain connectivity. Rather than focusing on how brain rhythms emerge or whether they are necessary for neural function, we ask what they tell us about functional brain connectivity. We hypothesize that if we were able to construct abstract networks, or “virtual brains”, whose dynamics were similar to EEG/MEG recordings, those networks would share structural features among themselves, and also with real brains. We have reverse-engineered network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves, which appear in the power spectrum as frequency bands superimposed on a non-oscillatory background dominated by low frequencies. We show that all reconstructed networks display similar topological features ( e. g. structural motifs ) and dynamics. We have also reverse-engineered putative diseased brains ( epileptic and schizophrenic ), in which the oscillatory activity is altered in different ways, as reported in clinical studies. These reconstructed networks show consistent alterations of functional connectivity and dynamics. In particular, we show that the complexity of the network, quantified as proposed by Tononi, Sporns and Edelman, is a good indicator of brain fitness, since virtual brains modeling diseased states display lower complexity than virtual brains modeling normal neural function.
The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) is one of the largest and most thoroughly-characterized samples of Hispanic individuals to date, with 1, 374 unrelated Hispanic individuals and a total of 2, 174 subjects of self-reported Hispanic ethnicity, including pedigrees. Using ∼60, 000 SNPs selected for minimal linkage disequilibrium, we perform population structure analysis of the MESA Hispanic cohort. By projecting principal components ( PCs ) of ancestry to samples from the HapMap phase III and the Human Genome Diversity Panel ( HGDP ), we show that the first two PCs quantify the Caucasian, African, and Native American origins, while the third and fourth PCs bring out an axis that aligns with known South-to-North geographic location of HGDP Native American samples and further separates MESA Mexican versus Central/South American samples along the same axis. Using k-means clustering computed from the first four PCs, we define four subgroups of the MESA Hispanic cohort that show close agreement with self-identification, labeling the clusters as primarily Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican. We present pooled and stratified association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions, previously reported in GWAS of Caucasians but as yet unconfirmed in Hispanic populations. We report statistically significant evidence for genetic association in both genes, and we further demonstrate the importance of considering population substructure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic association studies performed in the United States Hispanic population.
The Elongator histone acetyltransferase complex interacts with the proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( PCNA ) and plays a role in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability. The Elongator complex is composed of six subunits, with Elp3 being the catalytic subunit. Deletion of Elp3 results in partial loss of silencing of reporter genes at the chromosome VIIL telomere and at the HMR locus, as well as increased sensitivity to the DNA replication inhibitor hydroxyurea ( HU ) and the damaging agent methyl methanesulfonate ( MMS ). This suggests that the Elongator complex functions in a pathway independent of the histone chaperones Asf1 and CAF-1, which are involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. The Elongator complex also genetically interacts with mutations in POL30, which encodes PCNA, and PCNA binds to the Elongator complex both in vivo and in vitro. These results indicate that the Elongator complex plays a novel role in transcriptional silencing and maintenance of genome stability, and that it does so in a pathway linked to the DNA replication and DNA repair protein PCNA.
Biomedical knowledge curation is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process that relies on manual retrieval of relevant publications from databases such as PubMed. However, current query-based methods often yield unsatisfactory results in terms of precision and recall. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-assisted triage method that uses deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) to classify and rank new publications for curation. We trained our models on a gold-standard dataset of previously curated publications from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog. We then applied our method to the real-world manual curation process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog. Our results show that our machine-assisted triage method outperforms current query-based methods, achieving a precision 1. 81 and 2. 99 times higher than that obtained by the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. Our method also retrieves many additional relevant publications that the query-based method of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot could not find. We demonstrate that our machine learning-based method can make the triage process more efficient and is being implemented in production so that human curators can focus on more challenging tasks to improve the quality of knowledge bases.
Gain-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which encodes the Kir2. 1 channel, underlie variant 3 ( SQT3 ) of the short QT syndrome, a condition associated with atrial fibrillation ( AF ). This study investigated the mechanistic link between SQT3 mutations and atrial arrhythmogenesis using biophysically-detailed computer models of the human atria. The effects of heterozygous and homozygous forms of the D172N and E299V Kir2. 1 mutations on the atrial action potential ( AP ) were quantified in multi-scale homogeneous and heterogeneous tissue models. The D172N and E299V mutations produced distinct effects on the inward rectifier potassium current ( IK1 ) and AP duration ( APD ). Both mutations decreased the wavelength of re-entry through a reduction in effective refractory period ( ERP ) and conduction velocity ( CV ). The stability of re-entrant excitation waves in 2D and 3D tissue models was mediated by changes to tissue excitability and dispersion of APD in mutation conditions. Combined block of IK1 and IKr was effective in terminating re-entry associated with heterozygous D172N conditions, whereas IKr block alone may be a safer alternative for the E299V mutation. Combined inhibition of IKr and IKur produced a synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both forms of SQT3. This study provides mechanistic insights into atrial pro-arrhythmia with SQT3 Kir2. 1 mutations and highlights possible pharmacological strategies for management of SQT3-linked AF.
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi ( T. cruzi ), is a complex disease endemic in Central and South America. In this work, we investigated whether adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ( ASC ) can alter the course of the disease and attenuate pathology in a mouse model of chagasic cardiomyopathy. ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection ( dpi ) and remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days after injection. Most of the cells migrated to the abdominal or subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC injection resulted in a significant reduction in blood parasitemia, which was followed by a decrease in cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 dpi. At the same time point, analyses of cytokine release in cells isolated from the heart and exposed to T. cruzi antigens indicated an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals. In parallel, splenocytes exposed to the same antigens produced a pro-inflammatory response, which is important for the control of parasite replication, in placebo and ASC-treated groups. However, splenocytes from the ASC group released higher levels of IL-10. At 60 dpi, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that right ventricular ( RV ) dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice. In conclusion, the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents RV remodeling through the modulation of immune responses.
Leishmania parasites reside within parasitophorous vacuoles ( LPVs ) in infected mammalian cells. We have previously shown that Retro-2, a retrograde trafficking inhibitor, causes reduced LPV sizes and lower parasite numbers during Leishmania mexicana sp. infections. In this study, we evaluated the effects of two optimized analogs of Retro-2cycl, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36. 1, on Leishmania infections. These analogs have been reported to have superior potency in the inhibition of retrograde pathway-dependent phenomena. We show that DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36. 1 limit Leishmania amazonensis infection in macrophages at EC50 values of 13. 63+/-2. 58μM and 10. 57+/-2. 66μM, respectively, which is significantly lower than the EC50 of Retro-2cycl ( 40. 15μM ). In addition, these analogs caused a reversal in Leishmania-induced suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. Moreover, we show that DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36. 1 can kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures, which is a desirable attribute for any drug to treat Leishmania infections.
Leukemia-1a ( AML-1a ) is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of immune genes, including the Ly49 gene family. Here, we describe a computational method to predict the sensitivity of transcription factors to nucleosomes, which are the basic units of chromatin structure. Using this method, we identified AML-1a as a transcription factor that is sensitive to nucleosomes within the Ly49 gene family. We then confirmed this result in a cell line that naturally expresses Ly49, using a technique called MNase-Seq to generate a map of nucleosomes on chromosome 6, where the Ly49 gene family is located. Our analysis of this map revealed that nucleosomes are depleted at AML-1a binding sites in the expressed Ly49A gene, but not in the silent Ly49 genes. This suggests that nucleosomes may contribute to the regulation of Ly49 gene expression. We propose that this method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity could be useful for dissecting the regulatory role of nucleosomes in general.
Cyclin-dependent kinases ( CDKs ) orchestrate cell cycle progression, including genome duplication. CDK activation depends on phosphorylation of their T-loop by a CDK–activating kinase ( CAK ). In animals, the only known CAK for CDK2 and CDK1 is cyclin H-CDK7, which is constitutively active. However, the critical activation step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc25 phosphatases rather than unrestricted T-loop phosphorylation. CDK4 and CDK6 bound to cyclins D are master integrators of mitogenic/oncogenic signaling cascades by initiating the inactivation of the central oncosuppressor pRb and cell cycle commitment at the restriction point. We have identified the T-loop phosphorylation at T172 as the highly regulated step determining CDK4 activity. CDK7 inhibition prevented activating phosphorylations of CDK4/6, but for CDK4 this was at least partly dependent on its binding to p21cip1. In response to CDK7 inhibition, p21-binding to CDK4 increased concomitantly with disappearance of the most abundant phosphorylation of p21, which we localized at S130 and found to be catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2. The S130A mutation of p21 prevented the activating CDK4 phosphorylation, and inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impaired phosphorylations of both p21 and p21-bound CDK4. Therefore, specific CDK7 inhibition revealed the following: a crucial but partly indirect CDK7 involvement in phosphorylation/activation of CDK4 and CDK6; existence of CDK4-activating kinase(s) other than CDK7; and novel CDK7-dependent positive feedbacks mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2 to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage.
Male meiosis in plants is essential for sexual reproduction, but the mechanisms that control meiotic gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes are poorly understood. Here, we report that DUET/MMD1, a PHD finger protein, functions as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis in Arabidopsis. We show that DUET-PHD binds H3K4me2 in vitro and that this interaction is critical for its function during meiosis. We also show that DUET is required for proper microtubule organization during meiosis II, independently of its function in meiosis I. Remarkably, DUET expression is confined to the diplotene stage of prophase I. We identify two genes, TDM1 and JAS, as targets of DUET, with TDM1 being a direct target. TDM1 is required for meiotic cell cycle transitions and is not detected in female meiosis, suggesting that DUET might activate expression of male meiotic genes that contribute to sexual dimorphism. Our results also suggest a developmental function for H3K4me2 in Arabidopsis male reproduction. We show that DUET is required to regulate microtubule organization and cell cycle transitions during male meiosis, and functions as a direct transcription activator of the meiotic gene TDM1.
Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome ( FXTAS ) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by Fragile X premutation rCGG repeats. Previous studies have shown that rCGG repeats are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and that the rCGG repeat-binding proteins Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1 can modulate rCGG–mediated neuronal toxicity. To further explore the role of Pur α in rCGG–mediated neurodegeneration, we identified more than 100 proteins that interact with Pur α, including Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase. We found that rCGG repeats decrease the expression of Rm62 posttranscriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript, as well as additional mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. These findings suggest that abnormal nuclear accumulation of these mRNAs, likely as a result of impaired nuclear export, could contribute to FXTAS pathogenesis. We also found that the expression of fragile X premutation rCGG repeats significantly reduced the viability of otherwise viable heterozygous Rm62 mutant flies, providing further support for a strong genetic interaction between Rm62 and rCGG repeat-mediated neuronal cell death.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a paradigm organism for the study of biofilms. The extracellular matrix of P. aeruginosa biofilms is an ill-defined mix of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Here, we directly visualize the product of the polysaccharide synthesis locus ( Psl exopolysaccharide ) at different stages of biofilm development. During attachment, Psl is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern. This promotes cell–cell interactions and assembly of a matrix, which holds bacteria in the biofilm and on the surface. Chemical dissociation of Psl from the bacterial surface disrupted the Psl matrix as well as the biofilm structure. During biofilm maturation, Psl accumulates on the periphery of 3-D-structured microcolonies, resulting in a Psl matrix-free cavity in the microcolony center. At the dispersion stage, swimming cells appear in this matrix cavity. Dead cells and extracellular DNA ( eDNA ) are also concentrated in the Psl matrix-free area. Deletion of genes that control cell death and autolysis affects the formation of the matrix cavity and microcolony dispersion. These data provide a mechanism for how P. aeruginosa builds a matrix and subsequently a cavity to free a portion of cells for seeding dispersal.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies. Patient-derived xenografts ( PDX ) and patient-derived organoids ( PDO ) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation ( SV ) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.
A genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) was conducted in 19, 091 breast cancer cases and 20, 606 controls of East-Asian descent to identify novel genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. We evaluated 690, 947 single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in 2, 918 cases and 2, 324 controls, followed by a replication analysis of 5, 365 SNPs in 3, 972 cases and 3, 852 controls. The top 22 SNPs were further evaluated in 5, 203 cases and 5, 138 controls, and finally in up to 17, 423 additional subjects ( 7, 489 cases and 9, 934 controls ). We identified a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by SNP rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase ( TAB2 ) gene in chromosome 6q25. 1. This locus showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages, with a P-value of 3. 8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. Adjusted odds ratios ( 95% confidence intervals ) were 0. 89 ( 0. 85–0. 94 ) and 0. 80 ( 0. 75–0. 86 ) for the A/G and A/A genotypes, respectively, compared with the genotype G/G. We also identified two possible susceptibility loci represented by SNPs rs9383951 and rs7107217, located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24. 3, respectively.
Cryptococcal meningitis is a major cause of mortality in the developing world, yet little is known about the genetic markers underlying Cryptococcus neoformans virulence and patient outcome. We studied a cohort of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans ( Cn ) isolates from HIV-positive South African clinical trial patients with detailed clinical follow-up using multi-locus sequence typing ( MLST ) and in vitro phenotypic virulence assays, correlating these data with clinical and fungal markers of disease in the patient. We found that South African Cn displayed high levels of genetic diversity and locus variability compared to globally distributed types, with 50 sequence types grouped within the main molecular types VNI, VNII and VNB, and 72% of isolates typed into one of seven 'high frequency' sequence types. Through comparison of MLST genotyping data with clinical parameters, we found a relationship between genetic lineage and clinical outcome, with patients infected with the VNB lineage having significantly worse survival ( n=8, HR 3. 35, CI 1. 51-7. 20, p=0. 003 ), and this was maintained even after adjustment for known prognostic indicators and treatment regimen. Furthermore, we found evidence of lineage-associated virulence phenotype, with the VNII lineage displaying increased laccase activity ( p=0. 001 ) and ex vivo CSF survival ( p=0. 0001 ). These findings show that Cryptococcus neoformans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, and that lineage plays an important role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, has a pheromone response pathway that is unique to its white cell phenotype. Through the construction of an overexpression library for 107 transcription factors and mutational analyses, we have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of this newly evolved pathway. The elucidation of Tec1 establishes a comprehensive description of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans, providing insights into the evolution of new signal transduction pathways. The white cell pheromone response pathway appears to have been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans. The upstream portion of the pathway was derived from the upstream portion of the opaque pheromone response pathway of the mating process. Tec1, the transcription factor targeted by the MAP kinase pathway, was derived from a filamentation pathway. The white-specific downstream target genes were derived from an ancestral biofilm process. The evolution of this pheromone response pathway provides a possible paradigm for how such signal transduction pathways evolve.
Bacteria exhibit a wide range of genomic GC-content, varying from less than 20% to more than 70%. This variation has been ascribed to differences in the pattern of mutation between bacteria. Here, we test this hypothesis by examining patterns of synonymous polymorphism in 149 bacterial species from 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera. We find a large excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations segregating in all but the most AT-rich bacteria, across a broad range of phylogenetically diverse species. This excess of GC→AT mutations is inconsistent with mutation bias, since it would imply that most GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, which is unsustainable. We also show that the patterns are probably not due to translational selection or biased gene conversion, because optimal codons tend to be AT-rich, and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. Therefore, we conclude that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, we further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
Soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections, which include hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura, are a major public health problem in Kenya. To guide control efforts, it is essential to have accurate, contemporary maps that provide intervention recommendations at policy-relevant spatial scales. Here, we present a new approach for mapping the observed prevalence of STHs in Kenya, using data from 106, 370 individuals from 945 cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1974 and 2009. We used Bayesian space-time geostatistical models to interpolate the probability that infection prevalence exceeded the 20% threshold across the country for both 1989 and 2009. The resulting maps show that in most areas for 2009, there was high certainty that endemicity was below the 20% threshold, with areas of endemicity ≥20% located around the shores of Lake Victoria and on the coast. The model estimated that a total of 2. 8 million school-age children live in districts which warrant mass treatment. Our results suggest that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas of high prevalence and warrant mass treatment. As control is successful in reducing infection levels, updated models can be used to refine decision making in helminth control.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) infection is controlled by a coordinated response between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, resulting in a type 1 cytokine response. However, the contribution of innate lymphocytes to immunity against Mtb remains controversial. Here, we show that CD1d-restricted invariant NKT ( iNKT ) cells play a crucial role in controlling Mtb infection. We established an in vitro system to study this question and found that splenocytes from uninfected mice produce interferon-γ ( IFN-γ ) when cultured with Mtb-infected macrophages, resulting in suppression of bacterial replication. This innate control of bacterial replication is dependent on CD1d-restricted iNKT cells and their activation requires CD1d expression by infected macrophages as well as IL-12 and IL-18. We show that iNKT cells, even in limiting quantities, are sufficient to restrict Mtb replication. To determine whether iNKT cells contribute to host defense against tuberculosis in vivo, we adoptively transferred iNKT cells into mice and found that primary splenic iNKT cells obtained from uninfected mice significantly reduce the bacterial burden in the lungs of mice infected with virulent Mtb by the aerosol route. Thus, iNKT cells have a direct bactericidal effect, even in the absence of synthetic ligands such as α-galactosylceramide. Our finding that iNKT cells protect mice against aerosol Mtb infection is the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo.
Transglutaminases ( TGases ) are enzymes that catalyze the formation of intra- or intermolecular ε- ( γ-glutamyl ) lysil cross-links between proteins. In many cases, the activity of TGases is tightly controlled to prevent unwanted cross-linking reactions. However, the activity of Tgl, a TGase responsible for cross-linking proteins in the coat of Bacillus subtilis endospores, is not controlled by regulatory factors. Instead, we show that the activity of Tgl is controlled by its substrates, which are assembled onto the spore coat prior to Tgl production. These substrates govern the localization of Tgl to the surface of the developing spore, and residues important for substrate recognition are crucial for its localization. We also show that the first step in the reaction cycle, the interaction with Q-substrates and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, is the determinant step in the localization of Tgl. Consistent with the idea that Tgl exerts a “spotwelding” activity, cross-linking pre-formed assemblies, we show that C30 is an oblong hexamer in solution that is cross-linked in vitro into high molecular weight forms. Moreover, during the reaction, Tgl becomes part of the cross-linked products. We suggest that the dependency of Tgl on its substrates is used to accurately control the time, location and extent of the enzyme´s activity, directed at the covalent fortification of pre-assembled complexes at the surface of the developing spore.
Opisthorchis viverrini is a food-borne trematode species that causes biliary diseases and the fatal cholangiocarcinoma. In Lao PDR, an estimated 2. 5 million individuals are infected with O. viverrini, but epidemiological studies are scarce and the spatial distribution of infection remains to be determined. Our aim was to map the distribution of O. viverrini in southern Lao PDR, identify underlying risk factors, and predict the prevalence of O. viverrini at non-surveyed locations. A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was carried out in 51 villages in Champasack province in the first half of 2007. Data on demography, socioeconomic status, water supply, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data and fed into a geographical information system. Bayesian geostatistical models were employed to identify risk factors and to investigate the spatial pattern of O. viverrini infection. The prevalence of O. viverrini among 3, 371 study participants with complete data records was 61. 1%. Geostatistical models identified age, Lao Loum ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation ( i. e., rice farmer, fisherman, and animal breeder ), and unsafe drinking water source as risk factors for infection. History of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater bodies were found to be protective factors. Spatial patterns of O. viverrini were mainly governed by environmental factors with predictive modeling identifying two different risk profiles: low risk of O. viverrini in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor.
Lymphatic filariasis and malaria are major public health concerns in Dar es Salaam, United Republic of Tanzania. The presence of Anopheles and Culex larvae in the city's extensive drain network is likely to impact the transmission of these diseases by the resulting adult mosquito populations. However, the importance of drains as larval habitats remains unknown. We used data from the Urban Malaria Control Program ( UMCP ) and a special drain survey conducted in 2006 to obtain a typology of habitats and evaluate potential factors impacting the presence of mosquito larvae. We found that more than 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam were human-made, with drains being the most common aquatic habitat ( 42% ) and the most common habitat containing Anopheles ( 43% ) and Culex ( 33% ) larvae. Drains with stagnant water were more likely to contain Anopheles ( 8. 8 times ) and Culex ( 6. 3 times ) larvae than drains with normal water flow. We also found a positive association between vegetation and the presence of mosquito larvae. The proportion of habitats with mosquito larvae was spatially correlated. Our results suggest that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam has the potential to eliminate more than 40% of all potential mosquito larval habitats that are currently treated with larvicides by the UMCP.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) infection leads to an increase in the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase ( HMGCR ) in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells. This increase in HMGCR activity is associated with the inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ). AMPK is a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, and its inactivation leads to an increase in HMGCR activity. As a result, there is an accumulation of cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is necessary for the formation and maintenance of DENV replicative complexes. These complexes are essential for viral replication and are composed of viral proteins such as NS3, NS4A, and E, as well as HMGCR and cholesterol. Inhibition of HMGCR with lovastatin or activation of AMPK with metformin disrupts the formation of these complexes and reduces viral replication. In contrast, inhibition of AMPK with compound C leads to an increase in viral replication. These results suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation. This work provides new information about the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replicative cycle and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.
Translocation of transfer RNA ( tRNA ) on the ribosome is a fundamental process in protein synthesis, and understanding the kinetics and energy landscape of this process is essential for elucidating ribosome function. We used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 70S ribosome ( 2. 1 million atoms; 1. 3 microseconds ) to establish a quantitative bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and the continuous energy landscape of tRNA translocation. Starting from a pre-translocation configuration, we identified sets of residues that collectively undergo rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function. Estimates of the diffusion coefficients along these collective coordinates for translocation were then used to interconvert between experimental rates and measures of the energy landscape. This analysis, in conjunction with previously reported experimental rates of translocation, provides an upper-bound estimate of the free-energy barriers associated with translocation. We found that many residues undergo coordinated displacements, which are reminiscent of rigid body movement, and identified collective reaction coordinates that capture 30S-body rotation, 30S-head swivel and tRNA displacements, which are essential motions during substrate translocation. These findings provide a unifying foundation for understanding and interpreting all available data for tRNA translocation in the ribosome, and may be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions that include any number of intermediates and transition states.
Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) is a rare malignancy that arises from calcitonin-secreting para-follicular C cells and accounts for up to 3–5% of thyroid cancers. It can occur in a familial ( 25% ) or sporadic ( 75% ) pattern. The genetic landscape of MTC is not fully understood, although some oncogenic mutations have been identified. To explore the genetic profiles of MTCs, we assayed 84 sporadic MTC samples and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues on the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2. We discovered 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes in the 84 MTC tissue samples. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, occurring in 47 cases, followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 14 ), serine/threonine kinase 11 ( N = 11 ), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 6 ), mutL homolog 1 ( N = 4 ), Kiesten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( N = 3 ), and MET proto-oncogene ( N = 3 ). We also evaluated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ). Two of 98 screened cases were positive for ALK FISH, and we identified Glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 ( GFPT1 ) -ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 ( EML4 ) -ALK fusions. Notably, a metastatic MTC case harboring the EML4-ALK fusion showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib.
Asymptomatic leishmaniasis is an important challenge to achieving the goal of eliminating visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) in endemic countries. In the Malda district of West Bengal, India, a study was conducted to evaluate the role of asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission, prognosis, and the rate of transformation to symptomatic VL or post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis ( PKDL ). A total of 2, 603 individuals were screened for antileishmanial antibody using rK39-based rapid diagnostic kits, and 185 were found to be positive. Of these, 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 had no such history. Seventy-nine individuals were classified as asymptomatic leishmaniasis cases and 10 as active VL cases, with a ratio of 7. 9:1. During a three-year follow-up period, disease transformation was observed in 10. 39% ( 8/77 ) of asymptomatic cases, and sero-conversion was observed in 80. 52% ( 62/77 ) of cases. Seven individuals ( 9. 09% ) remained sero-positive even after three years. The study highlights the need for attention to asymptomatic infected individuals in the VL elimination programme initiated by three adjoining endemic countries.
Genome rearrangements, such as aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements ( GCRs ), can lead to the development of genetic diseases and cancer. In this study, we adapted Multiplex Ligation–dependent Probe Amplification ( MLPA ) to analyze a large number of GCRs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the distribution of translocations induced by the presence of the repetitive retrotransposon Ty912 in a wild-type strain was nonrandom and that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes, even though there were 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S. cerevisiae genome. The majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, but we also observed a number of nonreciprocal translocations mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements. These RAD52-independent translocations did not require the Rad51 or Rad59 homologous pairing proteins or the Rad1–Rad10 endonuclease complex that processes branched DNAs during recombination. Furthermore, we found that defects in ASF1-RTT109–dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 ( H3K56 ) resulted in increased accumulation of both GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications, and resulted in aneuploidy that tended to occur simultaneously with GCRs. Overall, we found that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy.
Protein docking, the association of two proteins, is driven by a free energy funnel determined by favorable interactions in some neighborhood of the native state. We describe a docking method based on stochastic global minimization of funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid body motions ( SE ( 3 ) ) while accounting for flexibility of the interface side chains. The method, called semi-definite programming-based underestimation ( SDU ), employs a general quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underestimator to bias further sampling. We introduce a strategy that uses separate independent variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance of the two proteins, and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules. The removal of the center-to-center distance turns out to vastly improve the efficiency of the search, because the five-dimensional space now exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation. This algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima and shows similarity to the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions. Results for standard protein docking benchmarks establish that in this space the free energy landscape is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state and that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation while achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods.
