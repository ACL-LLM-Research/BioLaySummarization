Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the process of cell-fate reprogramming, where one type of cell transforms into another. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, researchers have discovered a surprising role for the Notch signaling pathway in reprogramming germ cells into neurons. Notch signaling is typically known for maintaining undifferentiated stem cells in the germline, but in this study, it was found to promote reprogramming by activating specific genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2).

     The researchers used a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies to uncover the mechanism behind this unexpected role of Notch signaling. They identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial target of Notch signaling that facilitates reprogramming. UTX-1 is a key regulator of gene expression, and its activation by Notch signaling helps to counteract the silencing effects of PRC2.

     The study found that Notch signaling and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions, with Notch signaling promoting reprogramming and PRC2 maintaining the germline stem cell/progenitor fate. The researchers also discovered that many genes activated by Notch signaling are repressed by PRC2, suggesting a complex interplay between these two regulatory pathways.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of development and disease. Notch signaling has been implicated in various developmental processes and diseases, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The discovery of its role in reprogramming germ cells into neurons provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying these processes and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between different regulatory pathways in controlling cell fate decisions.

     Biomedical researchers have identified a key protein called SKAP2 that plays a crucial role in the body's defense against a type of bacterial infection called Klebsiella pneumoniae. This bacterium can cause respiratory, blood, liver, and bladder infections and is a significant concern for public health. The study found that mice lacking the SKAP2 protein had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden in their lungs compared to mice with the protein. This suggests that SKAP2 is essential for protecting against Klebsiella pneumoniae infections.

     Further investigation revealed that SKAP2 is necessary for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. Neutrophils from mice without SKAP2 were unable to produce ROS in response to Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is a critical mechanism for killing the bacteria. The study also found that the loss of SKAP2 hindered the activation of several proteins involved in the signaling pathways that lead to ROS production.

     The researchers used a mouse model of Klebsiella pneumoniae infection to study the role of SKAP2 in host defense. They found that SKAP2-expressing neutrophils were able to contain the bacterial infection in the lungs, independent of inflammatory monocytes. In contrast, neutrophils lacking SKAP2 were unable to trigger the signaling cascade required for ROS production after Klebsiella pneumoniae binding to surface receptors.

     The study suggests that SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for Klebsiella pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection. The researchers also found that the sensitivity of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ROS is supported by the increased bacterial burden in mice lacking the gp91phox component of NADPH oxidase, which is essential for ROS production. Overall, the study highlights the importance of SKAP2 in the body's defense against Klebsiella pneumoniae infections.
Biomedical researchers have developed a new mathematical model to understand how a type of malaria parasite, Plasmodium vivax, is transmitted from person to person. The model focuses on the "hypnozoite" stage of the parasite, which lies dormant in the liver and can cause relapse infections weeks to months after the initial infection. Relapse infections are a significant problem in areas where P. vivax is common, as they can lead to more cases of malaria and make it harder to control the disease.

The model shows that the hypnozoite reservoir is over-dispersed, meaning that some people have many hypnozoites in their liver, while others have very few or none. Individuals with more hypnozoites are more likely to experience relapses and contribute to the spread of the disease. The researchers used data from tropical strains of P. vivax to validate their model and found that it accurately predicted the build-up and depletion of the hypnozoite reservoir.

The model also suggests that incorporating a drug called primaquine into first-line treatment regimens could significantly reduce P. vivax transmission. Primaquine is known to kill hypnozoites, and the model predicts that targeting individuals with the most hypnozoites for treatment would be an effective way to break the cycle of relapse infections.

P. vivax has a unique life cycle that includes a liver stage, in addition to the blood stage and mosquito stage found in other types of malaria. The hypnozoite reservoir is a critical component of this life cycle, and understanding how it contributes to disease transmission is essential for developing effective control strategies. The new model provides valuable insights into the dynamics of P. vivax transmission and highlights the importance of targeting the hypnozoite reservoir in efforts to control the disease.

Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P. vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector, blood, and liver. The model developed in this study demonstrates that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate. This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P. vivax malaria.

Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long used neurosphere formation as a way to identify and study neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse brain. However, the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) and NSCs has remained unclear. A recent study aimed to prospectively identify and isolate NICs from the adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone (SVZ) and compare them to NSCs.

     The researchers used flow cytometry to identify NICs as GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45− cells, which they referred to as GEPCOT cells. These cells were found to be highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were quiescent, expressed higher levels of Glast, and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2. Pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers such as Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2, and were long-lived in the SVZ.

     The study found that GEPCOT NICs were highly enriched for multipotent cells that could form neurospheres and undergo multilineage differentiation. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers and were long-lived in the SVZ. The researchers also found that conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depleted both pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, although pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent on Bmi-1 for Cdkn2a (p16Ink4a) repression.

     The study's findings distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo. The researchers identified two phenotypically and functionally distinct populations of neural stem/progenitor cells from the adult mouse SVZ. GEPCOT cells were highly enriched for NICs and were highly mitotically active in vivo, but persisted only transiently in the SVZ. Pre-GEPCOT cells, on the other hand, were unable to form neurospheres but expressed stem cell markers and were long-lived in the SVZ.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how cells sense and respond to mechanical forces. A key player in this process is the Piezo1 ion channel, which can detect changes in membrane tension and convert them into electrical signals. To better understand how Piezo1 channels function, scientists used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to visualize the channel's structure. They found that Piezo1 has a bowl-shaped structure that can cause the cell membrane to curve, suggesting that the channels may interact with each other.

     To investigate this further, the researchers used a technique called cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology to study Piezo1 channels in cells that expressed the channel at low and high levels. They found that the density of Piezo1 channels did not affect their sensitivity to pressure or their ability to open and close. This suggests that Piezo1 channels function independently of each other, even when they are close together.

     The researchers also used computer simulations to model the behavior of Piezo1 channels at different densities. These simulations confirmed that the channels do not interact with each other in a way that would affect their function. This is important because it means that cells can use Piezo1 channels to sense mechanical forces in a uniform way across the entire cell membrane.

     The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of how cells respond to mechanical forces. Cells are constantly exposed to forces from their environment, and they need to be able to sense and respond to these forces in a coordinated way. The ability of Piezo1 channels to function independently of each other may be essential for this process. The researchers propose that this property allows cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane. This means that cells can respond to forces in a consistent and predictable way, which is critical for many cellular processes.
Summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how our brains make decisions. One theory suggests that decisions arise from the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. This theory predicts that increasing the noise in the evidence should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically, higher confidence. To test this theory, researchers introduced a novel sensory manipulation that mimicked the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex. They verified the effect of the manipulation by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of macaque monkeys.

     The researchers applied the manipulation to a well-studied motion task and found that increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence in both humans and monkeys. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model. The study showed that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision, or volatility, increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it.

     To test the influence of volatility on the decision process, the researchers mimicked a manipulation of noise by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus. They verified that the manipulation had the desired properties by recording from direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of the macaque visual cortex. Neurons in these areas are known to represent the momentary evidence in tasks identical to those in the study.

     The researchers studied the relationship between volatility and decision speed with a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task. Three human participants completed 6631 trials, and one macaque completed 14,137 trials. The results showed that increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model.
Summary
     The lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode worm, is regulated by multiple signaling pathways. One of these pathways is the insulin-like signaling pathway, which keeps the worm's lifespan relatively short. This pathway works by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, a transcription factor similar to the FOXO proteins found in mammals. However, another pathway, involving the enzyme Calcineurin (TAX-6•CNB-1) and the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (CAMKII) ortholog UNC-43, also plays a role in regulating the worm's lifespan.

     Researchers found that UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization, while TAX-6•CNB-1 removes the phosphoryl group from DAF-16, leading to its inactivation. This means that UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 have opposing effects on DAF-16, with UNC-43 extending the worm's lifespan and TAX-6•CNB-1 shortening it.

     The study also showed that the insulin signaling pathway dominates over the CAMKII/Calcineurin pathway when there is a conflict between the two. In other words, when the insulin signaling pathway is active, it overrides the effects of UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 on DAF-16. This suggests that the insulin signaling pathway has a more significant role in regulating the worm's lifespan.

     The findings of this study are similar to those in mammals, where the FOXO transcription factor FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin. The study provides new insights into the complex regulation of lifespan in C. elegans and highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between different signaling pathways in aging. The discovery of the opposing effects of UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 on DAF-16 also raises interesting questions about the balance between these pathways and their impact on the worm's lifespan.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the way animals perform complex actions, such as grooming, which involve the sequential execution of different movements. However, the underlying neural mechanisms that govern this process are not well understood. A recent study in fruit flies (Drosophila) has shed light on how the nervous system implements sequential grooming behavior. The researchers found that the motor programs responsible for cleaning individual body parts are organized into a suppression hierarchy, where earlier programs suppress later ones.

     The study used genetically targeted activation of neural subsets to drive distinct motor programs that clean specific body parts. By doing so, the researchers were able to demonstrate that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy. When one body part is cleaned, the sensory drive to its motor program is reduced, which in turn relieves the suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy.

     The researchers also developed a computational model that successfully reproduced the grooming sequence by simulating independently evoked cleaning movements that are activated in parallel but selected serially through hierarchical suppression. This model provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences.

     The study's findings suggest that the ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure for performing motor actions in sequence. This ability is thought to be evolutionarily ancient and is common to most limbed animals. The researchers anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism.

     The study's use of genetically targeted activation of neural subsets and computational modeling provides a powerful tool for understanding the neural control of serial action selection. The findings have implications for our understanding of how the nervous system implements complex behaviors and may have broader applications in fields such as robotics and artificial intelligence.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how cells ensure accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis, a complex process that requires coordination between multiple cellular processes. A recent study has shed light on the role of Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sgol2) in regulating meiosis I in mammalian oocytes. The research reveals that Sgol2 plays a crucial role in turning off the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), promoting the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitating the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments (K-fibers), and limiting bivalent stretching.

     Sgol2 achieves these functions by interacting with multiple proteins, including protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC) protein Mad2. Specifically, Sgol2 binds directly to PP2A and Mad2 to silence the SAC, recruits the kinesin MCAK to kinetochores to moderate chromosome stretching, and down-regulates the activity of Aurora B/C kinase to promote K-fiber formation. The study found that depleting Sgol2 in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and altered kinetochore-microtubule attachments.

     The research demonstrates that Sgol2's ability to protect centromeric cohesin depends on its interaction with PP2A. However, its effects on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation are independent of PP2A and mediated by the recruitment of MCAK and inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis I.

     The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of meiotic chromosome segregation and the role of Sgol2 in regulating this complex process. The research highlights the importance of Sgol2 in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation and suggests that its dysregulation may contribute to meiotic errors and aneuploidy. Further investigation into the mechanisms underlying Sgol2's functions and its interactions with other proteins will provide valuable insights into the regulation of meiotic chromosome segregation.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the strength and structure of connections between brain cells, called synapses, can change in response to experience. This process, called synaptic plasticity, is crucial for learning and memory. To understand how synapses adapt, researchers have been studying how proteins are made and delivered to synapses. A new study in the marine snail Aplysia reveals that proteins are not only made locally at synapses, but also transported from the cell's nucleus to synapses in response to stimulation. The study found that a protein called netrin-1 plays a key role in this process. Netrin-1 is released from the synapse and binds to a receptor on the surface of the neuron, triggering the translation of specific mRNAs into proteins at the synapse. This process allows the neuron to quickly respond to local cues and adapt to changing conditions. The study suggests that the spatial regulation of gene expression in neurons is primarily controlled at the level of translation, rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus. The findings have implications for our understanding of how synapses change in response to experience and how this process contributes to learning and memory. The study also highlights the importance of netrin-1 in regulating local translation and synaptic plasticity. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore their relevance to other types of neurons and organisms. The study's results provide new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity and the role of netrin-1 in regulating gene expression in neurons.
Summary
     Scientists have developed a new way to study how cells come together to form complex patterns and structures in the body. This process, called morphogenesis, is crucial for the development of tissues and organs. However, current methods for studying morphogenesis lack control over the interactions between different cell types and cannot selectively target specific cell populations.

     To address this limitation, researchers used a technique called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to silence specific genes in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). These cells have the ability to develop into any cell type in the body. By creating mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system, the researchers induced controlled symmetry-breaking events, which led to the formation of patterns within the cell colonies.

     The researchers specifically targeted two genes: ROCK1, which regulates cell tension, and CDH1, which controls cell-cell adhesion. By silencing these genes in only a subset of cells, the researchers observed a "bottom-up" pattern formation of the hiPSC colonies. This means that the cells themselves drove the formation of the patterns, rather than external factors.

     The study found that the induction of mosaic knockdown (KD) of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within the hiPSC colonies, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. The researchers also observed a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with the observed self-organization.

     This new approach enables the genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, which can facilitate a better understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis. The study provides a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations and control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells. This can lead to the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation.
Summary
     A new theory has been proposed to explain how the human brain processes visual information in working memory. Working memory is the ability to hold and manipulate information in our minds for a short period. The theory, called the "resource-rational theory," suggests that the brain tries to balance the cost of processing information with the need to perform well on a task. This balance is achieved by minimizing a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost.

     The theory was tested using data from nine experiments where participants were asked to remember and estimate the number of items in a visual display. The results showed that the theory accurately predicted how well participants performed on the task, taking into account the number of items they were asked to remember and the probability of being asked to recall a specific item. The theory also predicted that the amount of mental resources invested in processing information can vary in a non-linear way with the number of items to be remembered.

     The theory has implications for our understanding of cognitive limitations. Traditionally, it was thought that cognitive limitations arose from constraints on the brain's ability to process information. However, the resource-rational theory suggests that these limitations may arise from a rational decision-making process, where the brain tries to optimize performance while minimizing the cost of processing information.

     The theory may also apply to other cognitive processes, such as attention. Attention is the ability to selectively focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others. The theory suggests that attention may arise from a similar balance between performance and cost, where the brain tries to optimize performance while minimizing the cost of processing information.

     The theory makes several predictions that can be tested using neuroimaging experiments. For example, it predicts that the amount of neural activity in certain brain regions may vary in a non-linear way with the number of items to be remembered. The theory also predicts that incentive manipulations, such as offering rewards for accurate performance, may affect the balance between performance and cost, leading to changes in encoding precision.

     Overall, the resource-rational theory provides a new framework for understanding how the brain processes visual information in working memory and may have implications for our understanding of cognitive limitations and other cognitive processes.
summary
     Biologists have long known that plants use a process called autophagy to protect themselves against infectious diseases. Autophagy is a way for cells to recycle and remove damaged or dysfunctional components, including proteins and organelles. However, how plant pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes has remained a mystery.

     A recent study has shed light on this question by investigating the Irish potato famine pathogen, Phytophthora infestans. The researchers found that a protein called PexRD54, secreted by the pathogen, binds to a host autophagy protein called ATG8CL. This binding stimulates the formation of autophagosomes, which are structures that engulf and recycle cellular components.

     But here's the surprising twist: PexRD54 doesn't just stimulate autophagosome formation; it also depletes another protein called Joka2 from the ATG8CL complexes. Joka2 is an autophagy cargo receptor that helps to target specific proteins for degradation. By removing Joka2, PexRD54 interferes with the host's ability to defend against the pathogen.

     The researchers discovered that PexRD54 has an ATG8 interacting motif, a specific sequence of amino acids that allows it to bind to ATG8CL with high affinity. This is different from another pathogen, Legionella, which uses a different mechanism to interfere with autophagy. The study suggests that PexRD54 has evolved to activate autophagy for its own benefit, possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or reattribute cellular resources.

     The findings have significant implications for our understanding of how plant pathogens manipulate autophagy to their advantage. Autophagy is a complex process, and the study highlights the need for further research into the molecular mechanisms that mediate defense-related autophagy and the selective nature of this process. The study also raises questions about whether other plant pathogens use similar mechanisms to interfere with autophagy.

     The discovery of PexRD54's ability to bind to ATG8CL and deplete Joka2 provides a valuable tool for dissecting the mechanisms of defense-related selective autophagy. Further studies will be needed to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of autophagy and subcellular trafficking during host infection, and to determine whether other plant pathogens use similar mechanisms to manipulate autophagy.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) respond to changes in their environment, particularly in the context of cardiac injury. Cardiac fibroblasts play a crucial role in tissue adaptation and inflammation in response to pathological conditions such as ischemia. However, a comprehensive model of how early environmental changes trigger CF pathological responses has remained elusive due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation.

     To address this knowledge gap, a team of researchers developed a multi-stimulus microdevice that applies combined cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension to human primary cardiac fibroblasts. This innovative model recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury. The researchers found that individual stimuli, such as mechanical strain and oxygen changes, cause proliferative effects in CFs, including increased cell division and collagen production. However, only the combination of hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and simulated loss of contractility (2% strain) triggers the release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

     This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between environmental stimuli and CF responses. The findings suggest that the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility is a critical factor in inducing inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses in CFs. The researchers propose that their in vitro model can be used to better understand pathological mechanisms and develop reparative strategies for cardiac disease.

     The study builds on previous research that has examined the effects of mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical stimulation on CFs. However, this study is the first to finely control the applied mechanical strain and oxygen regimes to model early environmental changes in cardiac injury. The results have implications for future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the development of in vitro models for cardiac disease.

     The researchers used a multi-stimulus microdevice to apply combined cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension to human primary cardiac fibroblasts. They found that the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility triggers the release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between environmental stimuli and CF responses and has implications for the development of reparative strategies for cardiac disease.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that histone acetylation and the deposition of a specific type of histone called H2A.Z are crucial for active gene transcription. In fruit flies (Drosophila), a single complex called DOMINO is thought to perform both of these functions, but the exact mechanism was unclear. Researchers have now identified two distinct versions of the DOMINO complex, called DOM-A and DOM-B, which arise from alternative splicing of a single gene. These two complexes have different functions: DOM-B incorporates H2A.Z into chromatin in an energy-dependent manner, similar to the SWR1 complex in yeast. DOM-A, on the other hand, functions as an energy-independent histone acetyltransferase complex, similar to the NuA4 complex in yeast, and targets a specific lysine on histone H4.

     The discovery of these two complexes in Drosophila provides an example of how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation. In yeast, the SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are separate entities, while in humans, the paralogous SRCAP and EP400 protein ATPases organize different complexes that may serve distinct, conserved functions. In contrast, Drosophila generates diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene.

     The researchers used RNA sequencing to explore the functional differences of the two DOM isoforms on transcription. They found that knockdown of either DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP60, or H2A.V had distinct effects on gene expression. The study also suggests that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A complex, a principle that may be conserved across metazoans.

     H2A.Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers, where it is thought to regulate transcription initiation and early elongation. In yeast, H2A.Z is introduced into chromatin by the SWR1 complex, a multi-subunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler. The discovery of the DOM-A and DOM-B complexes in Drosophila provides new insights into the evolution of chromatin regulators and highlights the importance of alternative splicing in generating functional diversity.
Summary
     The formation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) between motoneurons and muscle cells is a complex process that requires precise communication between the two cell types. A key player in this process is the protein β-catenin (Ctnnb1), which is present in muscle cells and plays a crucial role in the differentiation of motoneurons. However, the mechanism by which muscle Ctnnb1 communicates with motoneurons to facilitate NMJ formation is not well understood.

     Researchers used a transgenic approach to investigate the functions of muscle Ctnnb1 in NMJ formation. They found that a mutant form of Ctnnb1 lacking the transcriptional activation domain (TAD) was unable to rescue the presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation, suggesting that transcriptional regulation is essential for muscle Ctnnb1 to control presynaptic differentiation. In contrast, the cell-adhesion function of Ctnnb1 was found to be dispensable.

     The researchers then screened for proteins that may serve as a Ctnnb1-directed retrograde factor and identified Slit2, a protein that repels or collapses neuronal axons. They found that overexpression of Slit2 in muscle cells was able to diminish the presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation in mice. Furthermore, Slit2 immobilized on beads was able to induce the formation of synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants.

     These observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation. The researchers also found that Ctnnb1 associates with Tcf/Lef cis-elements in the promoter region of the Slit2 gene, and that Slit2 expression in muscle cells is promoted by elevating Ctnnb1. Transgenic mice expressing Slit2 specifically in the muscle were able to diminish the presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density, and depressed miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs).

     Overall, these findings provide new insights into the mechanism of NMJ formation and suggest that muscle Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation through the transcriptional regulation of Slit2. This discovery has important implications for our understanding of the complex interactions between motoneurons and muscle cells during NMJ formation.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have developed a new method to study how forces are transmitted between cells in clusters of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells are a type of cell that line the surfaces and cavities of organs in the body. These cells are held together by cell-cell adhesions, which are like molecular "glue" that keeps them attached. The researchers used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to measure the forces transmitted between cells in these clusters.

     The study found that the forces transmitted between cells fluctuate over time, even when the cells are not dividing. The researchers focused on E-cadherin, a protein that is a key component of cell-cell adhesions. They found that the localization of E-cadherin molecules at the cell-cell junctions is correlated with the local mechanical stresses. This suggests that E-cadherin plays a crucial role in transmitting forces between cells.

     The researchers also found that the forces transmitted between cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction. The extracellular matrix is a network of proteins and other molecules that provides structural support to cells. Actomyosin contraction is a process by which cells contract and change shape.

     The study also revealed that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged, typically on the length scale of one cell diameter. This is due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell-matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility. The researchers' method provides new insights into the mechanisms that control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues.

     The study highlights the importance of coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors for force transmission through a cell. The researchers' method can be used to study mechanotransduction in cell-cell adhesions, which is the process by which cells respond to mechanical forces. This knowledge can have important implications for our understanding of tissue development, maintenance, and adaptation.
Summary
     Biologists have been trying to understand how a specific protein called huntingtin causes Huntington’s disease, a devastating neurodegenerative disorder. The protein has a long chain of glutamine amino acids, known as a polyglutamine tract, which is thought to be responsible for the disease. However, the exact mechanism of how this polyglutamine tract affects the protein’s structure and function has been unclear.

     A recent study used advanced biophysical techniques to investigate the structure of huntingtin and how the polyglutamine tract influences it. The researchers found that huntingtin has a unique spherical shape, composed of five distinct domains, with a central cavity. They also discovered that the polyglutamine tract increases the protein’s alpha-helical properties and affects the interactions between its domains.

     The study used a range of techniques, including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry, to analyze the structure of huntingtin with different lengths of polyglutamine tracts. The results showed that the polyglutamine tract has a significant impact on the protein’s structure, with longer tracts leading to increased alpha-helical properties.

     The researchers propose that the spherical shape of huntingtin enables the polyglutamine tract to modulate the protein’s structure and function. This modulation is thought to occur through changes in the protein’s interactions with its binding partners. The study provides a new understanding of how the polyglutamine tract affects huntingtin’s structure and function, shedding light on the mechanisms underlying Huntington’s disease.

     The findings of this study have important implications for the development of new treatments for Huntington’s disease. By understanding how the polyglutamine tract affects huntingtin’s structure and function, researchers may be able to design therapies that target this specific aspect of the protein. This could potentially slow or halt the progression of the disease, providing new hope for patients and their families.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long understood the importance of ferritinophagy, the process by which cells recycle ferritin, a protein that stores iron, to regulate intracellular iron levels. However, the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy and the role of the protein NCOA4 in this process have remained unclear. NCOA4 acts as a selective cargo receptor for autophagic turnover of ferritin, but how it interacts with ferritin and how its levels are regulated have been poorly understood.

     A recent study has shed light on the molecular nature of the NCOA4-ferritin complex and how intracellular iron levels modulate NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy. The researchers found that NCOA4 interacts directly with ferritin via a conserved domain on NCOA4 and a key residue on ferritin. This interaction is essential for the delivery of ferritin to lysosomes via autophagosomes.

     The study also revealed that NCOA4 levels are under dual control, regulated by both autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. When iron levels are high, NCOA4 is degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, leading to increased ferritin accumulation and iron capture. Conversely, when iron levels are low, NCOA4 levels increase, promoting ferritinophagy.

     The researchers identified the HERC2 ligase as a key regulator of NCOA4 turnover under high iron conditions. HERC2 uses its CUL7-homology domain to recognize NCOA4 and mediate its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This process reduces NCOA4 levels and increases ferritin for iron capture.

     The study also found that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is essential for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis. In zebrafish and cultured cells, NCOA4 plays a critical role in erythroid differentiation, suggesting that it is essential for the development and function of red blood cells.

     Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms controlling ferritinophagy and the role of NCOA4 in regulating intracellular iron levels. The findings have important implications for our understanding of iron metabolism and the development of therapies for iron-related disorders.
Summary
     The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its functional organization has remained unclear. A long-standing theory proposes that the LPFC is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information. However, previous support for this theory has been limited. A recent study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling to investigate the hierarchical organization of the LPFC. The results revealed rostral-caudal gradients of abstraction in the LPFC, indicating that progressively rostral areas process more abstract information. Dynamic causal modeling also showed asymmetrical interactions between LPFC sub-regions, suggesting hierarchical processing. Contrary to expectations, the mid LPFC was found to be the apex of the hierarchy, with stronger efferent (output) connections than afferent (input) connections. Cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards the mid LPFC, consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. Furthermore, the strengths of these dynamics were related to individual differences in higher-level cognitive ability. The study's findings suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized, with the mid LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior. The results also indicate that top-down control within the LPFC is an important determinant of higher-level cognitive function. Stronger asymmetrical hierarchical projections from the mid LPFC to other LPFC regions were related to better higher-level cognitive ability, suggesting a beneficial cognitive effect of a hierarchical organization. The study's findings provide new insights into the functional organization of the LPFC and its role in higher-level cognition.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the evolution of the human brain and its unique features, such as its large size and complex folding. One key aspect of brain development is the generation of neural progenitor cells, which give rise to the different types of brain cells. A recent study has identified a gene called TBC1D3 that plays a crucial role in this process.

     TBC1D3 is a gene that is specific to hominoids, a group of primates that includes humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Researchers found that when they expressed TBC1D3 in the brains of mice, it caused the generation of a type of neural progenitor cell called outer radial glia (oRG). These cells are similar to those found in the brains of primates and have a high proliferative ability.

     The study also found that the expression of TBC1D3 led to the formation of cortical folding in the brains of mice. Cortical folding is a characteristic feature of the human brain, and it is thought to be linked to the evolution of higher intelligence. The researchers propose that TBC1D3 acts as a candidate gene that controls many other genes involved in cortex expansion and folding.

     The study used a technique called in utero electroporation to introduce the TBC1D3 gene into the brains of mice. This allowed the researchers to observe the effects of the gene on brain development in real-time. They found that the expression of TBC1D3 caused the delamination of ventricular radial glia cells, which are a type of neural progenitor cell. This led to the generation of oRG cells, which are similar to those found in the brains of primates.

     The researchers also found that the expression of TBC1D3 caused a reduction in the expression of a gene called Trnp1, which is involved in stemness signaling pathways. This suggests that TBC1D3 may play a role in regulating the intrinsic stemness of neural progenitor cells.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development and the evolution of the human brain. The findings suggest that TBC1D3 is a key gene involved in the generation of oRG cells and the formation of cortical folding. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of TBC1D3 in brain development and its potential implications for human brain evolution.
summary
     Biologists have long known that a protein called NPR1 plays a crucial role in helping plants defend against pathogens. NPR1 acts as a coactivator, working with other proteins to turn on the expression of genes involved in the plant's immune response. However, NPR1 is an unstable protein, meaning it is constantly being broken down and rebuilt by the cell. This process, called ubiquitination, is thought to be necessary for NPR1 to be delivered to the right places in the cell where it can do its job.

    But researchers wanted to know if ubiquitination itself might also play a role in NPR1's activity, rather than just being a way to get it to the right place. They found that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a step-by-step process. First, a type of enzyme called a Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL3) adds a single ubiquitin molecule to NPR1. This initial modification allows NPR1 to bind to chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes, and turn on the expression of target genes.

    Next, another type of enzyme called an E4 ligase, UBE4, adds more ubiquitin molecules to NPR1, creating a longer chain. This longer chain marks NPR1 for degradation by the proteasome, a complex that breaks down and recycles proteins. However, if the ubiquitin chain is not long enough, NPR1 is not degraded and can continue to act as a coactivator.

    The researchers also found that there are enzymes that can remove ubiquitin molecules from NPR1, called deubiquitinases. These enzymes, UBP6 and UBP7, can prevent NPR1 from being degraded and allow it to continue to act as a coactivator. This balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination is crucial for the proper functioning of NPR1 and the plant's immune response.

    The study suggests that ubiquitination is not just a way to get NPR1 to the right place, but also plays a direct role in its activity. The initial ubiquitination by CRL3 is necessary for NPR1 to turn on the expression of target genes, while the longer ubiquitin chain formed by UBE4 marks NPR1 for degradation. This fine-tuning of NPR1's activity by ubiquitination and deubiquitination is essential for the proper functioning of the plant's immune response.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a crucial role in guiding DNA methylation and silencing of transposons and certain genes in plants. However, the precursors of these siRNAs were not well understood. Researchers have now identified the precursors of 24 nucleotide siRNAs (24 nt siRNAs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research. These precursors, called Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs (P4R2 RNAs), are generated by the enzymes RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2).

     The study found that P4R2 RNAs are typically 26-45 nucleotides long and start with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts. The researchers also discovered that RDR2 has terminal transferase activity, which may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at the 3' termini of P4R2 RNAs. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5' or 3' ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model in which siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.

     The study used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to identify P4R2 RNAs. They found that dozens of P4R2 RNAs can overlap at a given locus, but individual P4R2 RNAs represent individual Pol IV-RDR2 transcription units. The researchers also showed that the short double-stranded P4R2 RNAs that accumulate in dicer-like 3 (DCL3) mutants are the immediate precursors of siRNAs, based on the ability of DCL3 to cut these precursors into 24 nt RNAs in vitro.

     These findings provide new insights into the biogenesis of 24 nt siRNAs and the role of Pol IV and RDR2 in this process. The discovery of P4R2 RNAs as the precursors of siRNAs has significant implications for our understanding of gene regulation and epigenetic control in plants.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how immature neural networks develop into their mature form, enabling complex computations underlying cognition. A recent study investigated the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development in immature mice using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology. The findings reveal that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs.

The study found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was marked by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week. Following this timepoint, precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged. The researchers demonstrated a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation.

The study's findings indicate that a transient postnatal quiescent period precedes the emergence of mature cortical dynamics. During this period, oscillations and neural spiking display a nadir, signaling the shift from local, loosely correlated, putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity. The researchers hypothesize that the emergence of these advanced neural network properties could be heralded by the disappearance of immature activity patterns.

The study's results suggest that a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations. Neural spiking was more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent, strong phase-locking, and higher temporal precision during this period. These features are characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing. The study's findings provide new insights into the development of neural networks and the emergence of mature cortical dynamics, highlighting the importance of a transient postnatal quiescent period in this process.
Summary
     A new mathematical model has been developed to study the behavior of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria. The model focuses on the var gene family, which encodes the parasite's main surface antigen and allows it to evade the host's immune system. The var genes are highly diverse and undergo antigenic variation, meaning they can change their surface proteins to avoid detection by the immune system.

     The model shows that even with high levels of genetic recombination, the parasite population is structured into a subset of dominant repertoires of var genes. These repertoires are formed through competition among different var genes for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity. The degree of antigenic overlap between these repertoires depends on the intensity of transmission.

     The model's predictions are supported by empirical data on genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites. The study suggests that immune selection plays a key role in shaping the diversity of the parasite population. This has important implications for malaria control, as it means that vector control strategies may not always lead to a drastic reduction in var gene diversity.

     The model extends earlier strain theory by considering the effects of immune selection in populations of pathogens with multi-copy, recombining antigen-encoding loci. The var gene family of P. falciparum is used as the basis for the model, which tracks the dynamics of all possible var repertoires given a diverse pool of genetic variants.

     The study's findings have significant implications for malaria research and control. They suggest that a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse, highly non-overlapping var repertoires will remain even after vector control strategies are implemented. This means that new approaches to malaria control may be needed to effectively reduce the diversity of the parasite population.
summary
     A recent study has shed light on the mechanism by which the Shigella flexneri effector OspI disrupts the interaction between the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 and the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. OspI achieves this by deamidating a glutamine residue in UBC13, converting it to glutamate (Q100E). This modification silences the polyubiquitination activity of the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, which is essential for the downstream activation of the NF-κB inflammatory response.

     The researchers found that deamidation disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 by three mechanisms. Firstly, a new intramolecular salt-bridge forms in UBC13, competing with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6 interface. This competition prevents the formation of a typical UBC13/RING complex. Secondly, the salt-bridge competition also perturbs the UBC13/TRAF6 transient complexes, inhibiting association. Thirdly, repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged surface of TRAF6 prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex.

     Deamidation does not alter the local fold of UBC13, but rather creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6 interface. This is in contrast to RKIP, where deamidation alters the local fold of the protein. The study highlights a mechanism by which a post-translational modification can perturb the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.

     The findings have implications for our understanding of how Shigella flexneri suppresses the inflammatory response. By deamidating UBC13, OspI prevents the synthesis of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains, which are essential for the activation of the NF-κB pathway. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6, and highlights the importance of post-translational modifications in regulating protein-protein interactions.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long used a technique called optogenetics to activate or inactivate specific types of neurons in the brain to understand their functions. However, a new study suggests that this approach may not always provide a complete picture of how these neurons work. The researchers used optogenetics to activate or inactivate two types of interneurons, called somatostatin-positive (Sst+) and parvalbumin-positive (Pvalb+) neurons, in the auditory cortex of awake mice. They found that inactivating these neurons had different effects on the brain's response to sounds. Inactivating Sst+ neurons increased the brain's response to sounds, while inactivating Pvalb+ neurons weakened the brain's response and decreased the amount of information transferred. However, activating these neurons did not produce the same differences. This suggests that Sst+ and Pvalb+ neurons have distinct functions in the auditory cortex. The researchers used a simple computer model to understand why this might be the case. They found that small changes in the model's parameters, such as the amount of spontaneous activity or the strength of the light used to activate or inactivate the neurons, could determine whether activating or inactivating the neurons would produce consistent or opposite conclusions about their functions. This study highlights the complexity of the brain's neural circuits and the need for a more nuanced approach to understanding how different types of neurons work together to process information. The findings also suggest that simply activating or inactivating neurons may not always provide a complete picture of their functions, and that a more detailed understanding of the brain's neural circuits is needed to fully understand how they work.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers used a technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to investigate how brain activity affects working memory performance. Working memory is the ability to hold and manipulate information in our minds for a short period. The study aimed to determine if synchronizing brain activity in a specific network, called the frontoparietal network, could improve working memory performance.

     The researchers applied tACS to a group of participants while they performed a verbal working memory task. They found that synchronizing brain activity in the frontoparietal network improved working memory performance, especially when the task was demanding. The study also used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to observe changes in brain activity and connectivity.

     The results showed that synchronizing brain activity in the frontoparietal network increased activity in the parietal region of the brain, which is involved in working memory. The study also found that the phase of the tACS stimulation affected the flow of information between different brain regions. When the stimulation was in sync with the brain's natural activity, it increased interactions between the frontal and parietal regions. In contrast, when the stimulation was out of sync, it increased interactions between the parietal and posterior regions.

     The study provides evidence that synchronizing brain activity in the frontoparietal network can improve working memory performance. It also shows that the phase of the stimulation affects the flow of information between brain regions. These findings suggest that external manipulations of brain activity, such as tACS, can be used to improve cognitive function. The study's results have implications for the development of new treatments for cognitive disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Alzheimer's disease.

     The study's findings also highlight the importance of considering the phase of brain activity when designing interventions to improve cognitive function. The researchers suggest that synchronizing brain activity in the frontoparietal network could be a useful strategy for improving working memory performance in individuals with cognitive impairments. Overall, the study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and highlights the potential of tACS as a tool for improving cognitive function.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that invertebrates and some vertebrates, such as fish and amphibians, have their embryonic polarity determined by maternal factors present in the egg. However, mammals and birds have a more flexible development process, allowing them to form multiple individuals from a single embryo until a later stage. Researchers have been trying to understand how polarity is determined in these species.

     In chick embryos, a protein called cVg1, which is similar to a growth factor found in mammals, plays a key role in determining polarity. To find out what controls cVg1, scientists conducted a molecular screen and identified a transcription factor called Pitx2 as a potential regulator. They found that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation and directly regulates cVg1 expression by binding to specific DNA sequences.

     Pitx2 is also involved in left-right asymmetry, suggesting that the same mechanism of polarity determination has been co-opted for different functions during evolution. The researchers used a combination of bioinformatic analysis and embryological experiments to identify Pitx2 as a direct and essential regulator of cVg1 expression in both normal development and induced twinning.

     In most invertebrates and anamniote vertebrates, embryonic polarity is established by the localization of maternal determinants in the egg. However, higher vertebrates, such as mammals and birds, retain a regulative model of development until a later stage, suggesting that localizing maternal determinants is not essential for specifying embryo polarity.

     The study implicates Pitx2 as the earliest gene known to regulate the position of the embryonic axis, as well as embryonic regulation and twinning. Pitx2 is a transcription factor that is expressed in the same domain as cVg1 in whole embryos and isolated anterior halves, and it is expressed before cVg1. The results suggest that Pitx2 is a good candidate for an upstream regulator of cVg1 expression.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that animals use their sense of smell to navigate and find food. Fruit flies, in particular, rely heavily on their sense of smell to guide their behavior. To understand how flies process smells, researchers have been studying the neural circuits in the fly's antennal lobe, the part of the brain that receives sensory information from the fly's antennae.

     In a recent study, scientists investigated how the neural circuits in the fly's antennal lobe process smells that change over time. They found that the neurons in the antennal lobe, called projection neurons, play a crucial role in signaling the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. This means that the projection neurons are not just responding to the strength of the smell, but also to how quickly the smell is changing.

     The researchers used a simple mathematical model to understand how the projection neurons process the information from the sensory neurons that detect the smell. The model showed that the projection neurons are most strongly influenced by the rate of change of the smell, rather than the strength of the smell itself. This is important because it allows the fly to detect the onset of a smell at an early stage, even if the smell is rising slowly.

     The study suggests that the fly's early olfactory system is able to signal the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers, allowing the fly to rapidly respond to onsets of slowly rising odor stimuli. This is crucial for flying insects like flies, which need to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before their position drifts relative to adjacent plumes.

     The findings of this study build on previous research that has shown that sensory neurons in the fly's antennal lobe encode not only the strength of the smell, but also its rate of change over time. The study provides new insights into how the neural circuits in the fly's antennal lobe process dynamic olfactory stimuli, and highlights the importance of acceleration encoding in the fly's ability to detect and respond to smells.
Summary
     In flowering plants, seed development begins with the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The seed coat, which surrounds the fertilization products, develops before fertilization but is blocked by epigenetic regulators called Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins. Researchers have discovered that fertilization triggers the production of auxin, a plant hormone, in the endosperm, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues. This auxin production drives seed coat development by removing the PcG block.

     The study found that mutants lacking the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to seed abortion. The researchers propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, removing the PcG block on seed coat development. This suggests a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production in driving both endosperm and seed coat development.

     The study provides multiple lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis. First, auxin rapidly accumulates in the integuments after fertilization. Second, impaired auxin biosynthesis in the endosperm, but not auxin signaling, causes defects in seed coat development. Third, ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiate seed coat development without fertilization. Finally, failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlates with failure to export auxin from the endosperm.

     The researchers propose a model in which the fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin, which is exported to the integuments, lifting the PRC2 block on seed coat development and allowing for cell elongation and differentiation. However, this process is dependent on the activity of the transcription factor AGL62, as agl62 seeds fail to export auxin from the endosperm, leading to auxin accumulation and failure to develop a seed coat. This study provides new insights into the regulation of seed coat development and the role of auxin and AGL62 in this process.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, interact with their hosts. A key component of this interaction is the receptor binding protein (RBP), which helps the phage attach to the bacterial surface. Despite its importance, the molecular rules governing RBP function have remained unclear. To address this, researchers developed a new method called ORACLE, which allows for the creation of a large library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus. Using ORACLE, they systematically mutated the tip domain of the T7 phage RBP, making all possible single amino acid substitutions at every site, resulting in 1660 variants.

     The researchers then tested these variants on multiple bacterial hosts, generating high-resolution functional maps that revealed regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns. They discovered T7 variants with increased virulence compared to the wild-type phage, demonstrating that even well-adapted phages can be engineered for higher efficacy. The study also identified gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts.

     The researchers found that single amino acid substitutions alone can generate broad functional diversity, highlighting the evolutionary adaptability of the RBP. They also discovered that substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. To demonstrate the therapeutic value of ORACLE, the researchers engineered T7 variants that averted the emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections.

     The study presents a generalized framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems. The results indicate that ORACLE can generate phage variants superior to wild-type phage, which could serve as starting points for further engineering of therapeutic phages. Further experiments will be required to assess the in vivo efficacy of the T7 variants. The study provides valuable insights into the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range.
summary
     Individuals with congenital amusia, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, have been found to rely less on pitch cues during speech perception and more on other dimensions such as duration. A recent study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural basis for this strategy in 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls. Participants were asked to read sentences with a comma indicating a grammatical phrase boundary and then listen to two spoken sentences that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues, selecting the best match for the written sentence.

     The results showed that individuals with amusia had reduced functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, reflecting the between-group differences in cue weights. This difference in connectivity was not present during a control task. The study suggests that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, and that individuals with amusia may have developed a compensatory mechanism to down-weight pitch cues due to its unreliability.

     The findings are consistent with previous research showing that individuals with amusia rely less on pitch than controls to process spoken language. The study also found that the extent of pitch-responsive regions within auditory cortex is similar in participants with amusia and controls, and that brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is unimpaired in individuals with amusia. The results suggest that amusics neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable, and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the neural basis of congenital amusia and the compensatory mechanisms that individuals with the condition may use to process speech. The results have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of speech perception and the development of new treatments for individuals with amusia. Further research is needed to determine how functional connectivity in amusic and non-amusic participants may differ during speech encoding in pitch-related language tasks.
Summary
     A new contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 2 (DFT2), has been discovered in the Tasmanian devil, a species that already harbors a widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 (DFT1). Unlike DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, which play a crucial role in the immune system. However, the MHC class I alleles expressed by DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, making them less recognizable to the immune system.

     Researchers found that DFT2 cells express both classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules in the lab and in the wild. In contrast, DFT1 cells do not express MHC class I molecules. The DFT2 cells also express a non-polymorphic, non-classical MHC class I molecule that reduces their immunogenicity. Furthermore, the classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils.

     The study suggests that contagious cancers may exploit partial histocompatibility between the tumor and host, but the loss of allogeneic antigens could facilitate the widespread transmission of DFT2. The researchers propose that the similarity of MHC class I alleles between DFT2 and host devils may be due to a shared geographical range and genotype pool. The frequency of this allele among the wider population may impact the ability of DFT2 to spread further.

     The study also found that MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumors in the wild, suggesting that MHC class I-negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely. Further analysis is needed to define the host immune response to DFT2 and its role in shaping tumor evolution. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the emergence of contagious cancers and highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between tumors and their hosts.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) plays a crucial role in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. A recent study used optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal a double dissociation that allows parallel circuits in superficial RSG to process disparate inputs. The study found that the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly and selectively recruit small low-rheobase (LR) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information.

     The study also found that precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1 permits this parallel processing. Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation, despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. This suggests that parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG.

     The study highlights a superficial retrosplenial circuit enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents. LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum. The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs to LR cells can give rise to rate coding of angular head speed in LR cells.

     The study also found that anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum preferentially control LR neurons, whereas claustrum and anterior cingulate control RS cells. The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction, not speed.

     The study suggests that the distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them ideally suited to integrate head direction input from the thalamus and spatial inputs from the hippocampal formation via the dorsal subiculum. This integration of various types of directional and distance information is often stated as the key computational function of the retrosplenial cortex as a whole. Further research is needed to determine how these two parallel streams of information are integrated in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices.
Summary
     Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major risk factor for dementias such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, the mechanisms that promote the spread of tau protein aggregates after TBI are not fully understood. Researchers have been searching for a tractable animal model to study this process. A recent study used zebrafish to investigate the role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy after TBI.

     Zebrafish larvae were subjected to a novel TBI paradigm, which produced various TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and tau inclusions. The researchers introduced a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reliably reports the accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections. This allowed them to visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant central nervous system (CNS).

     The study found that post-traumatic seizures correlate strongly with spreading tau pathology following TBI. Manipulating seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation and revealed a critical role for endocytosis in the prion-like spread of Tau seeds in vivo following TBI. The results implicate seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds, offering potential therapeutic targets.

     The researchers also found that bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. This suggests that anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures may be a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of TBI-induced tauopathy and highlight the potential of zebrafish as a model organism for studying neurotrauma.

     Zebrafish larvae have emerged as a potent complement to rodent models of TBI and cellular models of tauopathy. The engineered fish allowed the researchers to reveal post-traumatic seizures as a druggable mechanistic link between TBI and the prion-like progression of tauopathy. Further work is warranted regarding anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy.
Summary
     The relationship between the spatial configuration of brain regions and functional connectivity has been a topic of interest in neuroscience research. Brain connectivity refers to the communication between different brain regions, and studies have used "functional connectivity fingerprints" to characterize individuals' brain activity. However, a new study suggests that the exact spatial arrangement of cortical regions interacts strongly with measures of brain connectivity. The researchers found that the shape and location of brain regions are strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. This means that variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions may be misinterpreted as changes in functional connectivity.

     The study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) data to investigate the relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity. rfMRI measures spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity, revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity between different brain regions. The researchers aimed to identify how the spatial configuration and organization of functional regions influence derived measures of functional connectivity and how they relate to trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals.

     The study found that network matrices, which are often used to estimate functional connectivity, contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information that is not also reflected in the spatial topographical organization of functional regions. This suggests that the cross-subject information represented in commonly adopted "connectivity fingerprints" largely reflects spatial variability in the location of functional regions across individuals, rather than variability in coupling strength. The researchers believe that this finding is important for interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits.

     The study highlights the need to disambiguate the influence of spatial topography to enable the estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling strength between neural populations. Recent advances have been made to tackle the issue of spatial misalignment across individuals, but more work is needed to fully understand the relationship between spatial configuration and functional connectivity. The study's findings have implications for the interpretation of functional imaging data and the understanding of brain function and behavior.
summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how cells change their gene expression patterns to become specialized for specific functions. In the case of skeletal muscle cells, researchers have proposed that a change in the components of the transcription pre-initiation complex (PIC) is necessary for muscle-specific gene expression. Specifically, it was suggested that the TBP2 protein replaces the canonical TBP protein in the PIC to activate muscle gene expression. However, a new study has challenged this idea and found that TBP, not TBP2, is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles.

     The researchers investigated the role of TBP2 in adult skeletal muscle regeneration and found that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts or primary mouse muscle stem cells (MuSCs). Moreover, TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild-type MuSCs. These findings suggest that TBP2 is not necessary for adult skeletal muscle regeneration.

     To further explore the role of TBP in muscle gene expression, the researchers compared the RNA expression profiles of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild-type mice and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line. They found that Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes, indicating that TBP is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression.

     The study also found that the TFIID complex, which contains TBP, is present in myogenic cells and drives muscle gene transcription during myoblast differentiation into myotubes. The researchers detected TAF subunits of the TFIID complex in both cultured C2C12 and MuSC myoblasts and myotubes at the RNA and protein levels, indicating that the TFIID complex is essential for muscle gene expression.

     Overall, this study provides new insights into the regulation of muscle gene expression and challenges the previous idea that TBP2 is necessary for muscle-specific gene expression. The findings suggest that TBP is the essential component of the PIC that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles, and that the TFIID complex plays a crucial role in driving muscle gene transcription during myoblast differentiation.
Summary
     Scientists used a technique called optogenetics to study how brain stimulation affects the connections between different parts of the brain in non-human primates. Optogenetics involves using light to activate specific neurons in the brain. The researchers used this technique to stimulate areas of the brain called the primary somatosensory cortex ( S1 ) and the primary motor cortex ( M1 ) in two macaques. They used electrocorticography ( ECoG ) to record the brain activity while stimulating these areas.

     The researchers found that stimulating S1 or M1 strengthened the connections between these areas and other parts of the brain. This effect was seen within minutes of stimulation and was consistent with a model of brain plasticity called Hebbian plasticity. Hebbian plasticity states that "neurons that fire together, wire together", meaning that when neurons are activated together, their connections between them are strengthened.

     The researchers also found that the connections between different parts of the brain changed in a complex way after stimulation. Some areas became more connected, while others became less connected. These changes were consistent with the idea that stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale network plasticity in a Hebbian manner.

     The study used a large-scale optogenetic interface that allowed the researchers to simultaneously stimulate populations of excitatory neurons and record ECoG activity across two brain areas. This interface enabled the researchers to estimate functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations between different parts of the brain.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for neurorehabilitation strategies. They suggest that targeted brain stimulation could be used to strengthen connections between different parts of the brain and promote recovery after brain injury or disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between stimulation-evoked activity and large-scale network plasticity.

     The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of brain plasticity and the effects of stimulation on large-scale networks. It also highlights the potential of optogenetics as a tool for studying brain function and developing new treatments for neurological disorders.
Summary
     A rare case of a Rhesus macaque monkey, born without primary visual cortex (V1), was studied to understand the neural consequences of such damage. The monkey, named S, showed unremarkable social behavior, but was impaired in visual task training. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that visual structures outside of the lesion were normal, and stimulation under anesthesia activated the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. However, visual cortical activation was sparse and limited to face patches.

     Functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. This suggests that the extrastriate cortical visual areas may play a role in residual visual function. The structural connectivity between subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, but the microstructure was intact.

     The study found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena. Residual vision can manifest in different ways, including the ability to determine information from faces. In monkey S, foci of activation in the region of V5/MT were observed in dorsal STS of both hemispheres, suggesting sub-threshold activation.

     A functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT was mapped out, even without strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses. The study suggests that retinal information may reach dorsal visual areas via weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests that either or both could support residual visual abilities.
Summary
     The innate immune system's ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the cell's nucleus is a crucial defense mechanism against pathogens. However, the molecular mechanisms behind distinguishing between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus were not well understood. A recent study used biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques to investigate how the innate immune sensor IFI16 recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus. The researchers found that IFI16 scans along exposed stretches of foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. They also discovered that nucleosomes, which are the building blocks of chromatin, act as barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with its one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish between friend and foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA.

     The study used time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays to demonstrate that IFI16 scans along exposed dsDNA to assemble into distinct clusters. They also found that chromatinization, or the packaging of DNA into chromatin, is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly. In vivo, this one-dimensional scanning mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate to large genomes of invading pathogens.

     IFI16 is a key innate immune sensor that detects foreign dsDNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms in both the host nucleus and cytoplasm. It plays a central role in defense against various pathogens, including herpes simplex virus-1. The study's findings provide a unifying molecular mechanism that explains how IFI16 resolves the central issues in initiating its foreign-dsDNA sensing pathways. The researchers propose that the one-dimensional diffusion-mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses.
Summary
     Scientists have developed a new technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics (STOMP) to study the composition of tiny protein deposits in the brain associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's. This technique uses a combination of two-photon laser scanning microscopy, photochemical affinity labeling, and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins present in these deposits at a resolution of 0.67 micrometers in the x-y plane and 1.48 micrometers axially.

     To use STOMP, a sample of tissue is first stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to highlight the areas of interest, such as amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease. The sample is then soaked in a solution containing a photo-tag, a molecule that binds to proteins and can be activated by light. The sample is then imaged using two-photon microscopy, which excites the photo-tag and causes it to bind to the proteins in the area of interest.

     After the photo-tagging process, the sample is solubilized and the photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified using mass spectrometry. This allows researchers to determine the composition of the protein deposits at a high level of detail. In a test case, STOMP was used to study amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and a post-mortem human brain sample, confirming the presence of known plaque constituents and identifying new ones.

     The technique has the potential to provide new insights into the causes of neurodegenerative diseases and to advance research in cell biology by allowing researchers to study the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification. STOMP can be applied to a variety of biological samples, including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered that the Frizzled3 (Fz3) gene plays a crucial role in the development of axons in motor neurons. Axons are long extensions of nerve cells that transmit signals from the brain to muscles and other parts of the body. In mice without the Fz3 gene, axons in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs fail to grow properly. These axons stall at a specific location in the nerve plexus and do not reroute to other trajectories, which is different from the behavior of axons in mice with defects in other signaling systems.

     The absence of Fz3 leads to the death of affected motor neurons two days before the normal wave of developmental cell death. This suggests that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. The researchers found that the primary cause of motor axon deficiency in Fz3-deficient mice is not due to defective motor neuron differentiation or excessive motor neuron death, but rather defective axon growth and/or guidance.

     The study highlights the importance of planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling in motor axon growth. PCP proteins form cell-cell complexes in epithelia, but their function in the dynamic context of axonal growth is not well understood. The researchers found that the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among limb motor axons, which is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in other signaling systems.

     The study provides in vivo evidence for the idea that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. This suggests that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons. The findings have implications for our understanding of how PCP proteins function in the dynamic context of axonal growth.
Summary
     Biologists have long thought that transposable elements (TEs), small pieces of DNA that can jump from one location to another, play a significant role in regulating gene expression in the early stages of mouse development. However, a new study suggests that while some TEs do contribute to gene regulation, many others do not. The researchers used a combination of genetic and epigenetic editing techniques to test the role of TEs in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. They found that a subset of TEs, specifically those belonging to the RLTR13D6 family, act as enhancers to drive the expression of lineage-specific genes. Enhancers are regions of DNA that increase the activity of nearby genes.

     The study used a technique called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) to turn off specific TEs and observe the effect on gene expression. They found that only a minority of the TEs they tested had a significant impact on gene regulation. The researchers also used CRISPR-mediated genetic excision to remove specific TEs from the genome and observed the effect on gene expression. They found that some TEs had a relatively small effect on gene expression, while others had no effect at all.

     The study highlights the importance of directly testing the functional role of TEs in gene regulation, rather than relying solely on correlative evidence from epigenomic and transcriptomic data. The findings suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, but that many others do not play a significant role. Further research will be needed to determine the proportion of TEs that act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how gene regulatory networks are established during early development.
Summary
     Biologists have long been puzzled by the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that has independently developed in at least 60 plant lineages. C4 photosynthesis is a more efficient way for plants to convert sunlight into energy, but scientists have struggled to understand how it emerged in so many different species. A new study has used a combination of data analysis and mathematical modeling to uncover the evolutionary paths that led to the development of C4 photosynthesis.

     The researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3-C4 forms of photosynthesis. They then developed a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model to predict how the C4 phenotype evolved. This approach allowed them to infer the likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data.

     The study found that the emergence of C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. The researchers also discovered that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. In other words, the evolution of C4 photosynthesis was influenced by factors other than photosynthesis itself.

     The study suggests that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space. This flexibility may have facilitated the convergent evolution of C4 photosynthesis in multiple lineages. The researchers propose that mechanistic diversity underlies the multiple evolutionary pathways generating C4 photosynthesis, which may be a key factor in facilitating the convergent evolution of complex traits.

     The findings of this study have implications for efforts to recapitulate the acquisition of C4 photosynthesis through genetic engineering of C3 species. By understanding the evolutionary paths that led to the development of C4 photosynthesis, scientists may be able to develop new strategies for establishing C4 traits in distinct phenotypic backgrounds. Overall, this study provides new insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis and highlights the importance of considering non-photosynthetic drivers in the evolution of complex traits.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the energy released from the hydrolysis of nucleoside triphosphates, such as ATP and GTP, is crucial for various cellular processes. However, the specific role of the nucleotide base itself in these processes has remained unclear. A recent study has shed light on this mystery by reengineering a bacterial protein, SpoIVA, to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to drive the formation of static polymers during the sporulation process in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.

     The researchers found that the reengineered protein, SpoIVAGTPase, was functional in vivo and could use either ATP or GTP to induce a conformational change after nucleotide hydrolysis. However, it only polymerized in the presence of ATP, suggesting that the nucleotide base itself, rather than just the energy released from hydrolysis, is critical for its function. The study also showed that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase.

     The researchers further investigated the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide specificity in SpoIVA from GTP to ATP. They found that at the end of sporulation, when SpoIVA is actively assembling the spore coat, the levels of ATP are significantly higher than those of GTP. This suggests that the increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation may have driven the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.

     The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of the specific roles of nucleotide bases in cellular processes. The results suggest that the nucleotide base itself, rather than just the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical for specific biological functions. This knowledge can inform the design of new therapeutic strategies that target specific nucleotide-binding proteins. The study also highlights the importance of considering the nucleotide base in the context of cellular processes, rather than just focusing on the energy released from hydrolysis.
Summary
     A recent study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. Leptin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and has neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. Researchers restored leptin signaling in mice that were previously deficient in the leptin receptor gene at either the fourth or tenth week of age. The study found that some defects caused by neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, such as poor development of neural projections in the arcuate nucleus, were reversible by reactivating leptin signaling in adulthood. However, leptin deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity due to suppression of energy expenditure. Additionally, reactivating leptin signaling in adulthood resulted in persistent reduction in the expression of certain genes involved in energy homeostasis and caused defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. These findings suggest that early defects in leptin signaling can cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems.

     The study highlights the importance of leptin signaling during development for long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin. Previous research has shown that changes in leptin signaling during development can affect the organization of neural circuits that regulate energy homeostasis, leading to an increased risk of metabolic diseases later in life. The study also found that early postnatal leptin blockage in rats leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity.

     The researchers used knockout mice that grew without leptin's effects to investigate the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. They found that leptin or leptin receptor deficiency leads to reduced brain mass, disruption of neural projections from the arcuate nucleus to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, and behavioral and cognitive problems. The study aimed to evaluate the possible consequences of the lack of leptin signaling in early life on brain development.

     The study's findings contribute to the understanding of metabolic programming and indicate which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life. The results have implications for the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide and highlight the importance of leptin signaling during development for long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin.
summary
     Biologists have long known that plants have an immune system that helps protect them from disease-causing bacteria and other pathogens. One key part of this system is a receptor called FLS2, which detects the presence of bacterial flagellin, a protein found on the surface of many bacteria. When FLS2 detects flagellin, it activates a signaling pathway that leads to the production of immune responses, such as the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activation of defense genes. However, the exact mechanism by which FLS2 activates this pathway has been unclear.

     A recent study has shed new light on this process. The researchers found that a group of proteins called heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of XLG2, AGB1, and AGG1/2, play a crucial role in FLS2-mediated immunity. These G proteins directly interact with FLS2 and another protein called BIK1, which is a central component of the FLS2 signaling pathway. In the absence of flagellin, the G proteins help to maintain the stability of BIK1 by preventing its degradation by the proteasome, a complex that breaks down proteins.

     When flagellin is detected, the G proteins dissociate from AGB1 and are phosphorylated by BIK1. This phosphorylation event enhances the production of ROS, which is a key component of the plant's immune response. The researchers also found that the G proteins are necessary for the activation of the NADPH oxidase RbohD, an enzyme that produces ROS.

     The study demonstrates that the G proteins are directly coupled to the FLS2 receptor complex and regulate immune signaling through both pre-activation and post-activation mechanisms. The findings suggest that the G proteins play a critical role in maintaining the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state, and that they dynamically interact with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex during FLS2 signaling. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant immunity and highlights the importance of heterotrimeric G proteins in this process.
Summary
     The Arabidopsis circadian clock is a complex system that regulates gene expression across the day-night cycle. While previous studies have identified a multiple feedback loop circuit that generates the 24-hour rhythm, it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells and how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. A recent study examined clock activity at the single-cell level in Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. The results reveal robust single-cell oscillations, albeit desynchronized, with two waves of clock activity observed: one going down and one up the root. The study also found evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, particularly in the root tip.

     The researchers used a reporter for the core clock gene CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) to examine the dynamics of the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at the single-cell level. They estimated the coupling strength between cells and found evidence of coupling, especially strong in the root tip. A simple model suggested that the observed period differences between cells, combined with cell-to-cell coupling, can generate the observed waves in clock gene expression.

     The study's results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralized mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points. The researchers also found that the structure of the plant clock is more complicated than previously thought, as a hierarchical model does not explain the observed short period oscillations in the root tip or the wave of clock gene expression up from the root tip. Instead, the results support a more decentralized model of clock coordination in plants.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the coordination of the Arabidopsis circadian clock and suggest that the plant clock is more complex and decentralized than previously thought. The results also highlight the importance of cell-to-cell coupling in generating the observed waves of clock gene expression. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of the plant circadian clock and its role in regulating gene expression across the day-night cycle.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers investigated how the brain processes speech in noisy environments, specifically in individuals with clinically normal hearing. They found that people with normal hearing can have difficulty understanding speech when multiple speakers are talking at the same time. The researchers used a combination of behavioral and physiological tests to identify neural biomarkers that could predict this difficulty.

     The study involved over 100,000 patient records and found that about 10% of adults with clinically normal hearing had trouble understanding speech in noisy environments. The researchers used electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the ear canal to measure the brain's response to frequency modulation (FM) cues, which are important for speech processing. They found that the brain's ability to process FM cues was a strong predictor of speech intelligibility in noisy environments.

     The researchers also used pupil-indexed listening effort and behavioral FM thresholds to account for the variability in speech intelligibility. They found that these measures, combined with neural temporal fine structure processing, explained about 78% of the variability in speech intelligibility. This suggests that the brain's ability to process speech in noisy environments is a complex process that involves both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms.

     The study's findings have implications for the diagnosis and treatment of hearing disorders. The researchers identified a set of neural biomarkers that could be used to identify individuals with clinically normal hearing who struggle to understand speech in noisy environments. This could lead to the development of new clinical tests and interventions for these individuals. The study's results also suggest that the brain's ability to process FM cues is an important factor in speech intelligibility, and that this ability can be measured using EEG recordings from the ear canal.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying speech processing in noisy environments and has the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of hearing disorders. The researchers hope that their findings will inform the development of next-generation clinical tests and interventions for individuals with clinically normal hearing who struggle to understand speech in noisy environments. The study's results also suggest that the brain's ability to process FM cues is an important factor in speech intelligibility, and that this ability can be measured using EEG recordings from the ear canal.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long faced a challenge in visualizing blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the living retina, a part of the central nervous system. The transparency of the eye provides a noninvasive view of the microvessels, but imperfections in the eye's optics blur microscopic retinal capillaries and single blood cells flowing within. To overcome this limitation, scientists used 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in the C57BL/6J mouse, a widely used research animal.

     The researchers employed ultrafast imaging and an automated analysis pipeline to measure the speed of millions of blood cells in vessels ranging from 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers in diameter. This allowed them to capture blood flow rates spanning four orders of magnitude, from 0.0002 to 1.55 microliters per minute. The study did not require surgery or the use of contrast dye, making it a noninvasive and minimally invasive approach.

     The imaging technique, known as adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO), uses near-infrared backscatter to visualize blood cells without the need for foreign dye injections. This allowed the researchers to achieve sub-micrometer precision when measuring the diameters of retinal vessels. In total, 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied, providing a comprehensive understanding of blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the retina.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for the early evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries. The ultrafast imaging and automated analysis pipeline developed in this study can be directly applied to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation. Furthermore, the eye may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the central nervous system and systemic microvascular health.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how plants form symbiotic relationships with other organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, to obtain essential nutrients like phosphate and nitrogen. A key receptor-like kinase called Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase (SYMRK) plays a crucial role in two types of symbiosis: phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. However, the mechanisms that determine which type of symbiosis develops have remained unclear.

     Researchers have discovered that overexpressing certain receptor-like kinase genes, including Nod Factor Receptor 1 (NFR1), NFR5, and SYMRK, in plant roots can trigger the formation of nodules and the expression of genes related to nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, even in the absence of bacteria. This suggests that these receptors can initiate the process of nodule formation independently of bacterial signals. Furthermore, the researchers found that SYMRK associates with NFR1 and NFR5 in plant roots, indicating that these receptors work together to regulate symbiosis.

     The study also showed that SYMRK can initiate signaling independently of NFR1 and NFR5, and that it plays a key role in deciding between AM and root nodule symbiosis. In contrast, overexpressing NFR1 or NFR5 alone did not trigger the expression of genes related to AM symbiosis. The researchers propose that SYMRK's ability to form complexes with multiple receptors may explain how it can initiate both types of symbiosis.

     The discovery of SYMRK's role in regulating symbiosis has important implications for our understanding of how plants interact with their environment. It also highlights the complexity of the signaling pathways involved in symbiosis and the need for further research to fully understand the mechanisms at play. Overall, this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying symbiotic relationships between plants and other organisms.
Summary
     A new software toolkit called DeepPoseKit has been developed to quickly and accurately estimate the location of an animal's body parts from images or videos using deep learning methods. This toolkit addresses the limitations of current animal pose estimation methods, which are often slow and prone to errors. The DeepPoseKit uses an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model called Stacked DenseNet and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm to estimate keypoint locations with subpixel precision. This approach improves processing speed by more than two times compared to existing methods without compromising accuracy. The toolkit has been tested on various challenging animal pose estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals.

     The DeepPoseKit is built on the state-of-the-art individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks and achieves fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization ability. The new pose estimation model, Stacked DenseNet, offers significant improvements over existing models. The code, documentation, and examples for the software package are freely available under a permissive open-source license. The toolkit has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment by enabling the creation of larger, higher-resolution, and more reliable behavioral datasets.

     Unlike conventional computer-vision methods, modern deep-learning–based methods can achieve near-human-level accuracy in various scenarios by manually annotating data and training a general-purpose image-processing algorithm. The DeepPoseKit can run inference at a rate of 30–110 Hz, depending on the resolution of the predicted confidence maps, making it suitable for real-time applications. This toolkit reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new way that the body's immune system responds to infection and stress. When immune cells, such as macrophages, encounter a pathogen or environmental stress, they activate a complex called an inflammasome. This inflammasome triggers a pro-inflammatory response and a type of cell death called pyroptosis. The researchers found that a drop in a molecule called NADH, which is produced during a process called glycolysis, is a signal for the inflammasome to activate. Glycolysis is the process by which cells break down glucose for energy. The researchers also found that when the pathogen Salmonella typhimurium infects cells, it disrupts glycolysis, leading to a drop in NADH levels and the activation of the inflammasome. This response is important for the body to fight off the infection. The researchers also found that adding products that restore NADH production can prevent the activation of the inflammasome and pyroptosis. This suggests that the body's immune system is able to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens through the disruption of glycolytic flux. The researchers propose that innate immune cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, leading to the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the initiation of inflammatory responses. They also found that inhibitors of enzymes involved in glycolysis and the pathogen S. typhimurium can limit glycolysis, leading to the activation of the inflammasome and pyroptosis. Furthermore, the researchers found that supplementing cells with pyruvate, a product of glycolysis, can prevent the activation of the inflammasome and pyroptosis. This suggests that the body's immune system is able to sense metabolic perturbation as a danger signal, leading to the activation of the inflammasome and the initiation of inflammatory responses. Overall, the researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the body's immune system responds to infection and stress, and have highlighted the importance of glycolytic flux in the activation of the inflammasome and the initiation of inflammatory responses.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have made a significant discovery about a protein called PALB2, which plays a crucial role in repairing damaged DNA in cells. PALB2 is a tumor suppressor protein that helps maintain the integrity of chromosomes and is linked to various types of cancer, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. The protein interacts with other proteins, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, to facilitate a process called homology-directed repair (HDR), which is a non-mutagenic pathway of chromosome break repair.

     The researchers identified a specific region of PALB2 called the N-terminal DNA-binding domain (N-DBD), which is responsible for binding to DNA. They found that mutations in this region significantly reduced the efficiency of HDR in cells by 50%. Furthermore, the N-DBD was shown to stimulate the function of RAD51, a protein involved in HDR, even in the absence of other proteins. Surprisingly, the N-DBD also exhibited strand exchange activity without RAD51 and could use RNA as a substrate.

     The study revealed that PALB2's interaction with DNA is critical for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to damaged DNA sites and efficient DNA repair in cells. The researchers also demonstrated that the N-DBD stimulates RAD51-mediated strand exchange in vitro. These findings highlight the importance of PALB2's DNA-binding activity in maintaining chromosome integrity.

     PALB2's role in DNA repair is closely linked to its interaction with BRCA1 and BRCA2, which initiate RAD51-mediated homologous recombination and facilitate the restart of stalled replication. The study suggests that PALB2's DNA-binding activity is essential for its function, and mutations in this region can lead to defective DNA repair. The researchers propose that PALB2's interaction with DNA is critical for the recruitment of BRCA2 and RAD51 to damaged DNA sites and efficient DNA repair in cells. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of DNA repair and the importance of PALB2's DNA-binding activity in maintaining chromosome integrity.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that actin-like proteins form filaments from pairs of protofilaments arranged in a parallel fashion. However, a new study reveals that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments in an antiparallel arrangement. This means that the two protofilaments in each pair run in opposite directions, unlike the parallel arrangement seen in other actin-like proteins.

     Researchers used a combination of techniques, including crystal structures and electron microscopy, to study MreB from the bacterium Caulobacter crescentus. They found that the antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments allows each subunit to interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the cell. This unique arrangement also explains why MreB filaments can assemble and disassemble in a non-polar manner, meaning that both ends of the filament can grow or shrink at the same rate.

     The study also showed that the mechanism of protofilament formation in MreB is similar to that of other actin-like proteins. When MreB polymerizes, it undergoes a typical domain closure, which is a common feature of actin-like proteins. Additionally, the researchers found that the antimicrobial agents A22 and MP265 bind to MreB close to the bound nucleotide, preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilizing the double protofilaments.

     The antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is unprecedented among actin-like proteins and is essential for MreB's function in maintaining cell shape. The researchers demonstrated this by deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix and mutating the residues in the hydrophobic loop of MreB, which made the protein less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of Caulobacter MreB revealed the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the structure and function of MreB and its role in maintaining cell shape. The antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments is a novel feature of actin-like proteins and has important implications for our understanding of cell biology and the development of antimicrobial agents.
summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how plants maintain consistent forms despite genetic variation. A key example of this is the number of petals on a flower. In the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, the number of petals is always four, but in the closely related species Cardamine hirsuta, the number of petals can vary. Researchers have now identified a gene called APETALA1 (AP1) as a major contributor to this difference. AP1 is a regulator of flower development that acts early in the process to initiate flowers and later to specify floral organs.

     The researchers found that AP1 in Arabidopsis thaliana masks the effects of other genes that control petal number, resulting in a consistent four-petaled flower. In contrast, the AP1 gene in Cardamine hirsuta fails to perform this masking function, allowing the effects of other genes to be expressed and resulting in variable petal number. This difference in AP1 function is due to changes in the upstream regulatory regions of the gene.

     The researchers also found that the AP1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana is able to complement the function of the AP1 gene in Cardamine hirsuta, resulting in variable petal number in Arabidopsis thaliana. This suggests that there may be hidden genetic variation in Arabidopsis thaliana that is normally masked by the AP1 gene. The researchers also found that the AP1 gene in Cardamine hirsuta is associated with variable petal number when it is expressed in the second whorl of the floral meristem, but not when it is ectopically expressed in the third whorl.

     Overall, the researchers conclude that the divergence of the AP1 gene between Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta has exposed cryptic genetic variation in Cardamine hirsuta that contributes to the maintenance of variable petal number within natural accessions of the species. This study highlights the importance of AP1 in regulating flower development and the complex interactions between genes that control petal number.
Biomedical researchers have made a significant discovery about the progression of type 2 diabetes. They found that proinsulin, a precursor to insulin, misfolds and forms abnormal complexes in the early stages of the disease. Proinsulin is a critical protein that helps regulate blood sugar levels, and its proper folding is essential for its function.

    Normally, proinsulin folds into a specific shape with three internal disulfide bonds. However, in people with a perturbed endoplasmic reticulum folding environment, proinsulin fails to fold correctly and forms non-native disulfide-linked complexes with other proinsulin molecules. This misfolding is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes, even before the onset of beta-cell dysfunction and insulin deficiency.

    The researchers used several lines of evidence to support their findings, including studies on human islets, genetically obese mice, and mice deficient in the leptin receptor. They found that in these models, proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes were more abundant, and this increase tracked with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes.

    Specifically, the researchers identified two cysteine residues, Cys(B19) and Cys(A20), as necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes. They also found that proinsulin Cys(B19)-Cys(B19) covalent homodimers were resistant to reductive dissociation, providing a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation.

    The study suggests that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with beta-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes. This finding has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat the disease.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that a protein called Suv39h1 plays a crucial role in forming a type of chromatin called heterochromatin. Heterochromatin is a tightly packed, inactive form of chromatin that helps regulate gene expression. Suv39h1 achieves this by adding a specific chemical tag, called a methyl group, to a particular histone protein called H3K9. However, the exact mechanisms by which Suv39h1 targets specific regions of the genome to form heterochromatin were not well understood.

     Researchers have now discovered that Suv39h1's ability to bind to nucleic acids, such as RNA and DNA, is essential for its function in heterochromatin assembly. They found that Suv39h1 has a higher affinity for RNA than DNA and that its ability to bind nucleic acids is independent of its recognition of methylated H3K9. Furthermore, the study showed that Suv39h1 binds to major satellite RNAs in living cells and that knocking down these RNAs reduces Suv39h1's retention on pericentric heterochromatin.

     The researchers also found that Suv39h1's nucleic acid-binding activity cooperates with its recognition and binding of methylated H3K9 to establish and maintain pericentric heterochromatin. They demonstrated that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to the targeting and retention of Suv39h1 at specific chromosomal regions. Additionally, the study showed that Suv39h1's RNA-binding activity contributes to its stable association with H3K9me3-rich pericentromeric regions.

     The findings of this study suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs play a crucial role in Suv39h1's ability to target specific regions of the genome and form heterochromatin. The study highlights the importance of nucleic acid-binding activity in Suv39h1's function and provides new insights into the mechanisms of heterochromatin assembly. The results also demonstrate that Suv39h1's multiple activities, including its lysine methyltransferase activity, HP1-binding activity, and chromatin-binding activity, work together to regulate pericentric heterochromatin assembly.
Summary
     The entorhinal cortex is a region of the brain that plays a crucial role in navigation and spatial memory. It contains a type of cell called grid cells, which are thought to help the brain keep track of an animal's position in space. Recent research has suggested that grid cells may not only be involved in navigation, but also in other mental processes. However, for this to be true, grid cell activity must not depend on physical movement. A new study has investigated whether grid cells in the entorhinal cortex can be activated by movement of attention, without any physical movement.

     The study used two monkeys that were trained to perform a task where they had to focus their attention on a small dot moving around a computer screen, while keeping their eyes fixed on a central point. The researchers recorded the activity of 141 neurons in the entorhinal cortex while the monkeys performed the task. They found that 14% of the neurons had spatially structured receptive fields, meaning that their activity was organized in a grid-like pattern. This is similar to the grid cells found in the entorhinal cortex, which are thought to be involved in navigation.

     The study's results provide evidence that grid cells in the entorhinal cortex can be activated by movement of attention, without any physical movement. This suggests that grid cells may not only be involved in navigation, but also in other mental processes, such as attention and perception. The study's findings are consistent with previous research that has shown that grid cells can be activated by eye movements, even when the animal is stationary.

     The study's results have important implications for our understanding of the neural basis of spatial representation and attention. They suggest that the entorhinal cortex plays a key role in processing spatial information, and that grid cells may be involved in a range of cognitive functions, including attention and perception. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, but the study's findings provide a significant step forward in our understanding of the neural basis of spatial representation and attention.
Summary
     A team of researchers has developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice. The task, which involves head-fixed mice making choices based on visual stimuli, was designed to be reproducible across multiple laboratories. To achieve this, the researchers standardized the training protocol, experimental hardware, software, and procedures. They trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries and collected over 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database.

     The results showed that while learning speed varied across mice and laboratories, once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories relied similarly on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These findings demonstrate that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories.

     To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, the researchers adopted an open science approach, sharing the hardware and software components and experimental protocols. This approach allows other researchers to use the same methods and compare their results with those from other laboratories. The researchers hope that these resources will catalyze the development of new adaptations and variations of their approach and accelerate the use of mice in high-quality, reproducible studies of neural correlates of decision-making.

     The study's findings have implications for the field of neuroscience, where reproducibility has been a concern. By establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, the researchers provide a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches. The large dataset and open-access tools generated by this study will enable other researchers to study decision-making in mice and compare their results with those from other laboratories.
Summary
     Scientists have created a detailed map of the genes expressed in the intestine of a type of flatworm called Schmidtea mediterranea. This flatworm, also known as a planarian, has the unique ability to regenerate its organs, including its gut. The researchers used a technique called laser-capture microdissection to isolate specific cells from the planarian intestine and analyze their gene expression. This approach allowed them to identify hundreds of genes that were previously unknown to be expressed in the intestine.

     The study found that the planarian intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, nutrient storage and transport, and innate immunity, similar to the digestive systems of other animals, including humans. The researchers also discovered that certain genes are expressed in specific regions of the intestine, a phenomenon known as regionalization. This regionalization was particularly evident in goblet cells, which are specialized cells that produce mucus.

     The study identified two transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, that play distinct roles in the differentiation and maintenance of goblet cells. Depleting these cells reduced the planarians' ability to feed and their overall viability, but had little effect on the regeneration of other intestinal cell types or non-intestinal tissues. This suggests that goblet cells are essential for the proper functioning of the planarian intestine.

     The researchers also identified 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several required for the production and maintenance of goblet cells. These findings provide a foundation for further studies on the mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration. The study's results demonstrate the conservation of digestive physiology and cell types between planarians and other animals, including humans, and highlight the potential of planarians as a model organism for studying the digestive system.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by how animals adapt to their environments through changes in their sensory systems. A recent study on weakly electric fish has shed new light on this process. These fish use electric signals to communicate with each other, and researchers wanted to understand how different species perceive and respond to these signals.

     The study found that different species of weakly electric fish have distinct ways of processing these signals. Some species can detect subtle variations in the waveform of the signals, while others are insensitive to these variations. The researchers discovered that the species insensitive to waveform variations have sensory receptors that produce spontaneous oscillations. When these receptors receive an electric pulse, they reset their phase, resulting in a brief period of synchrony among the receptors. This synchrony encodes information about the timing and location of the signal, but not its waveform.

     The researchers found that these oscillating receptors are most sensitive to frequencies found in the collective signals of groups of conspecifics, and this sensitivity is correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. This suggests that these receptors may be specialized for detecting signals from large groups of fish. In contrast, species with spiking receptors are better suited for detecting signals from individual fish.

     To test this idea, the researchers performed playback experiments where they presented a single fish with a train of electric signals at constant intervals. The results showed that species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to signals with submillisecond intervals, while species with spiking receptors did not. This supports the hypothesis that oscillating receptors are an adaptation for detecting communication signals from large groups of fish.

     The study provides the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony and highlights the diversity of mechanisms used by different species to perceive and respond to their environment. The findings have implications for our understanding of how animals adapt to their social environments and how sensory systems evolve to meet the demands of different ecological niches.
Summary
     A team of researchers has used cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) to determine the structure of the BPP-1 bacteriophage at a resolution of 3.5 Å. BPP-1 infects and kills Bordetella species, which cause whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in other mammals. The phage has a unique diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) that provides a naturally occurring phage-display system, but engineering efforts have been hindered by the lack of atomic structures.

     The researchers used cryoEM to determine the structure of the BPP-1 head, which revealed two distinct protein folds: a jellyroll fold for the cement protein (CP) and an HK97-like fold for the major capsid protein (MCP). Strikingly, the fold topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. This new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old topology.

     The researchers also found that β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1, unlike covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering.

     The study provides an atomic description of the BPP-1 head, which will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive to stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses. The researchers used single-particle cryoEM to determine the 3D structure of the BPP-1 head at a resolution of 3.5 Å and derived an atomic model.

     The BPP-1 phage has a T = 7l icosahedral capsid, ∼670 Å in diameter, and a 7 Å resolution cryoEM structure showed that its capsid protein has an HK97-like fold, but the shell has an additional protein component. The researchers found that BPP-1 CP and MCP adopt two of the three characteristic folds of major virus lineages, jellyroll and HK-97/Johnson. The topology of the Johnson fold in BPP-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted as compared to the previously known topology of the Johnson fold.
Summary
     Scientists have studied how the dengue virus (DENV) adapts to different environments, such as human and mosquito cells. To do this, they used a technique called ultra-deep sequencing to analyze the genetic changes that occur in the virus as it replicates in these cells. This allowed them to understand how beneficial and harmful mutations affect the virus's fitness, or ability to survive and reproduce.

     The researchers found that the virus accumulates a large number of harmful mutations, which counterbalance the effect of rare beneficial mutations that help the virus adapt to its host. These beneficial mutations tend to occur in specific regions of the virus's genome and in areas of the protein structure that are flexible and can change shape. This flexibility may allow the virus to adapt more easily to its host.

     The study also identified "hotspots" of adaptation, where many beneficial mutations occur in the same location. These hotspots were found in specific regions of the virus's genome and in the structure of a protein called dengue protein E, which forms the outer layer of the virus. The researchers suggest that these hotspots may be important for the virus's ability to adapt to its host.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into how the dengue virus evolves and adapts to different environments. They also highlight the importance of understanding the balance between beneficial and harmful mutations in shaping the virus's fitness. The study's results may have implications for the development of new treatments and vaccines against dengue fever.

     The researchers used a technique called CirSeq to analyze the genetic changes that occur in the virus as it replicates in human and mosquito cells. This allowed them to estimate the fitness effects of all possible single-nucleotide variants in the virus's genome. The study found that adaptation relies on host-specific beneficial mutations that are clustered in specific regions of the DENV genome and enriched in regions of the proteome that exhibit structural flexibility.

     The study's findings are consistent with previous research on the dengue virus and Zika virus, suggesting that similar evolutionary constraints shape the long-term evolution of these viruses. The study's results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of selection and adaptation operating on DENV populations in cells and in host populations.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers used a technique called single-particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (spt-PALM) to study how a specific protein called KRasG12D moves and behaves on the surface of cells. KRasG12D is a mutant form of a protein called KRas, which is involved in sending signals inside cells. The researchers found that KRasG12D moves in three different ways on the cell surface: slowly, at an intermediate speed, and quickly. They also discovered that KRasG12D is removed from the cell surface and then replenished, a process called internalization and recycling.

     The researchers found that KRasG12D moves slowly in small domains, about 70 nanometers in size, which are embedded in larger domains, about 200 nanometers in size. These larger domains allow KRasG12D to move at an intermediate speed. The rest of the cell surface supports fast movement of KRasG12D. The movement and behavior of KRasG12D remain the same even when the amount of KRasG12D in the cell changes.

     The researchers propose a new model to describe how KRasG12D moves and behaves on the cell surface. According to this model, nested membrane domains dictate the movement and behavior of KRasG12D. This model has implications for understanding how KRasG12D forms complexes with other proteins and sends signals inside the cell.

     The study provides new insights into how complex structures on the cell surface, called nanodomains, organize and influence the movement and behavior of KRasG12D. This knowledge can help guide future research into the molecular and structural identities of these nanodomains and how they affect KRasG12D signaling. The study's findings can also contribute to a better understanding of how KRasG12D is involved in various cellular processes, including cell growth and division.
Summary
     Biologists have long understood that Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs) play a crucial role in patterning the dorsoventral (DV) axis of vertebrates and invertebrates during embryonic development. A key aspect of this process is the formation of a BMP signaling gradient, which is essential for the proper development of various tissues and organs. However, the mechanism behind this gradient formation has remained unclear.

     In a recent study, researchers used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish embryos. They developed a quantitative imaging method to directly measure the BMP signaling gradient and integrated the results with a mathematical model to identify the underlying mechanism. The study aimed to determine whether the BMP signaling gradient is established by a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, a BMP shuttling mechanism, or a transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism.

     The researchers found that the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is not established by a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists or a BMP shuttling mechanism. Instead, they discovered a new mechanism, known as the source-sink mechanism, where a restricted distribution of BMP antagonists acts as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. This mechanism relies on the diffusion of Bmp2, a BMP ligand, which supports the source-sink model.

     The study's findings suggest that the BMP signaling gradient in zebrafish is shaped by a complex interplay between BMP ligands and antagonists. The source-sink mechanism provides a new understanding of how BMP gradients are formed during development and highlights the importance of BMP signaling in patterning the DV axis. This research has significant implications for our understanding of developmental biology and may lead to new insights into the regulation of BMP signaling in various biological processes.
Summary
     Lysosomes are tiny compartments within cells where proteins and other molecules are broken down and recycled. To understand how lysosomes work, researchers have been studying the proteins that help move molecules in and out of these compartments. One of these proteins, called MFSD1, has been poorly understood until now. Scientists have discovered that MFSD1 is essential for maintaining a healthy liver and that it relies on another protein called GLMP to function properly.

     MFSD1 belongs to a family of proteins called the major facilitator superfamily, which helps move molecules across cell membranes. The researchers found that MFSD1 is not attached to the cell membrane by sugar molecules, which is unusual for a protein of its type. They also identified a specific sequence of amino acids, called a dileucine-based sorting motif, that helps MFSD1 get to the lysosomes.

     To study the function of MFSD1, the researchers created mice that lacked the gene for MFSD1. These mice developed enlarged spleens and severe liver disease, indicating that MFSD1 plays a critical role in maintaining liver health. The researchers then isolated lysosomes from the livers of these mice and compared them to lysosomes from normal mice. They found that GLMP, a previously unknown protein, was essential for MFSD1 to function properly.

     The researchers discovered that GLMP and MFSD1 physically interact with each other and that GLMP is necessary for maintaining normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes. They also found that mice lacking the gene for GLMP developed the same liver disease as the mice lacking MFSD1. These findings suggest that MFSD1 and GLMP form a tightly linked complex that is essential for the proper functioning of lysosomes in the liver.

     The study provides new insights into the role of MFSD1 and GLMP in maintaining liver health and highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between proteins within lysosomes. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which MFSD1 and GLMP work together to maintain liver homeostasis.
Summary
     Biologists have long understood that kinesin motors play a crucial role in moving cargo along microtubules, which is essential for various cellular processes. However, the exact mechanism of how kinesin motors work has remained unclear. To gain insight into this process, researchers used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to create high-resolution images of kinesin motors attached to microtubules in different states. They obtained images of kinesin motors with and without ATP, a molecule that provides energy for the motor's movement.

     The researchers found that when kinesin motors attach to microtubules, a specific part of the motor called the "linchpin" residue triggers a change in the motor's shape, allowing it to release ADP, a molecule that is released when ATP is broken down. When ATP binds to the motor, the shape of the motor changes again, allowing it to move along the microtubule. This process is similar to how other motors, such as myosin and F1-ATPase, work.

     The researchers also found that the microtubule can regulate the motor's affinity for ADP and ATP by changing the shape of a part of the motor called the "switch loops." This means that the microtubule can control how tightly the motor binds to ADP and ATP, which is essential for the motor's movement. The researchers identified several sites in the kinesin fold that can uncouple the motor's nucleotide affinity from its microtubule affinity, but the structural basis of this uncoupling has remained unclear.

     To further understand the mechanism of kinesin's microtubule-attached cycle, the researchers solved high-resolution cryo-EM reconstructions of the human monomeric kinesin motor domain attached to the microtubule in two different chemical states. They found that the motor's nucleotide cleft closes in a "clamshell-like" manner when ATP binds, allowing the motor to move along the microtubule. The researchers also found two previously unidentified binding modes of kinesin in which the motor domain attaches tightly to the microtubule but is rotationally mobile. These findings provide a structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules.
Scientists have long known that mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, require a quality control system to remove misfolded proteins that can harm the cell. However, the mechanisms behind this process were not well understood. A recent study in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) has shed light on a protein quality control pathway at the outer membrane of mitochondria.

    The researchers used two temperature-sensitive (ts-) proteins, sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts, which misfold and are degraded at high temperatures. They found that these proteins are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, a cellular process that tags and breaks down damaged or misfolded proteins. The ubiquitin ligases Ubr1 and San1 were identified as the enzymes responsible for tagging sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts, respectively, with ubiquitin molecules.

    The study also found that the heat shock proteins SSA and Sis1, which are involved in protein folding, play a crucial role in the degradation of these misfolded proteins. Additionally, the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex and its associated co-factors, including Doa1 and Ubx2, were found to be essential for the degradation of these proteins.

    The researchers observed that the ubiquitinated forms of sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts accumulated in the mitochondrial pellet fraction when the proteasome was impaired, suggesting that the mitochondria-associated degradation (MAD) pathway is distinct from other cellular quality control pathways. Furthermore, the study found that the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex is required for efficient proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated mitochondrial QC substrates.

    This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of protein quality control at the mitochondrial outer membrane and highlights the importance of the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 complex in the degradation of misfolded mitochondrial proteins. The findings have implications for our understanding of mitochondrial function and dysfunction in various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that a protein called extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) plays a crucial role in controlling cell growth and division. However, it has been difficult to study how ERK activity is generated and spread throughout tissues. To address this, researchers used a special tool called a FRET biosensor to visualize ERK activity in the skin of living mice. This allowed them to observe how ERK activity moves from cell to cell in real-time.

     The study found that ERK activity often spreads in a radial pattern, starting from a few cells and moving outward in a circular motion. This phenomenon, called Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution (SPREAD), occurs in the basal layer of the epidermis, which is the outermost layer of the skin. SPREADs were also observed in other areas of the skin, including the back.

     The researchers found that the frequency of SPREADs correlates with the rate of cell division in the epidermis. This suggests that SPREADs may play a role in regulating cell growth and division. Additionally, the study found that SPREADs are stimulated by a chemical called 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), which activates the epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) that trigger ERK activity.

     When the skin is wounded, ERK activity spreads in a different pattern, forming a "trigger wave" that moves parallel to the wound edge. This suggests that ERK activation can be superimposed on existing patterns of activity. The study also found that SPREADs are associated with the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, which is the stage at which cells prepare to divide.

     Overall, this study provides new insights into how ERK activity is regulated in living tissues and how it contributes to cell growth and division. The findings have implications for our understanding of skin health and disease, and may lead to the development of new treatments for conditions such as skin cancer.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that living organisms have internal clocks that regulate daily physiological changes, known as circadian rhythms. However, these clocks do not function independently but are influenced by external cues, such as light and darkness, which vary with the seasons. Researchers have been trying to understand how these internal clocks align with external cycles, but the underlying principles are not well understood.

     A team of scientists has developed experimental platforms to study the circadian clock of cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria, both in living cells and in a laboratory dish. They found that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in response to light-dark cycles, tracking midday across different day lengths. This means that the internal clock adjusts its timing to match the external light-dark cycle, regardless of the length of the day.

     The researchers also reconstituted the core biochemical oscillator responsible for the circadian rhythm in a laboratory dish using purified proteins. They simulated seasonal effects by driving the proteins with pulses of nucleotides on a 24-hour cycle, mimicking the metabolic conditions during day and night. Surprisingly, the in vitro system showed a similar linear scaling of clock phase with simulated day length, indicating that the core mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to the proteins.

     The findings suggest that the entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a mathematical framework with a small number of parameters. This framework can be used to guide experiments that probe the molecular origins of key mathematical features. The researchers believe that their model is general and can be applied to other organisms, not just cyanobacteria.

     The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of circadian biology and has the potential to predict the behavior of circadian rhythms in various time-varying environments. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding how the internal clock is deformed by coupling to the environment, which is a key determinant of entrained behavior.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the underlying causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in the general population. Genome-wide association studies have identified the transcription factor Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. A recent study investigated the role of Meis1 in the development and function of sympathetic neurons, which play a crucial role in regulating heart rate and rhythm.

     The study found that inactivating Meis1 in the neural crest, a group of cells that give rise to sympathetic neurons, led to an imbalance in the regulation of heart functions in adult mice. This imbalance resulted in conduction defects and chronotropic incompetence, making the mice more susceptible to SCD. The researchers also discovered that Meis1 is essential for the proper innervation of target fields by sympathetic neurons and that its loss leads to the death of these neurons through apoptosis.

     Further investigation revealed that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery, which is critical for the transport of molecules within cells. In Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons, the traffic of endosomes was severely altered. The study also found that Meis1 interacts with various trophic factors and signaling pathways during the differentiation of postmitotic neurons.

     The researchers demonstrated that the loss of Meis1 function in early sympathetic neurons leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adult mice, resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD. They also showed that Meis1 acts independently of the well-studied network of transcription factors governing early specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later phases of neuronal differentiation.

     The study highlights the importance of Meis1 in the development and function of sympathetic neurons and its potential role in mediating susceptibility to unexplained SCD. The findings suggest that Meis1 is a novel actor in sympathetic neurons differentiation and that its loss can lead to neurodevelopmental defects and increased risk of SCD. The study's results complement previous research on the role of Meis1 in cardiogenesis and provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying SCD.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the diverse shapes and structures of biofilms, complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces. Despite knowing the essential components required for biofilm formation, scientists have not understood how these components shape the biofilm's surface morphology. To address this question, researchers used a combination of experiments and simulations to study biofilms of Vibrio cholerae, a type of bacteria that causes cholera. They found that mechanical instabilities, such as wrinkling and delamination, play a crucial role in shaping the biofilm's surface. These instabilities occur as the biofilm grows and builds up compressive stress, causing it to wrinkle and eventually delaminate.

     The researchers also discovered that interfacial energy, or the energy associated with the interactions between different parts of the biofilm, drives the generation of new interfaces and the annihilation of existing ones. This process, called mechanomorphogenesis, shapes the overall contour of the biofilm. Feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion also plays a key role in determining the biofilm's final shape.

     The study's findings suggest that the principles of mechanomorphogenesis, which rely on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, are not unique to biofilms and may be applicable to morphogenesis processes in higher organisms. The researchers propose that exploiting mechanical principles to drive key morphogenic events is an ancient process that has been conserved across evolution, from bacteria to eukaryotes. Biofilms, therefore, represent an attractive model system for investigating the general role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and for morpho-engineering.

     The study's results have implications for the development of new strategies to address biofilm-related problems, such as the formation of biofilms on medical devices. By understanding the mechanical and material properties of biofilms, researchers may be able to discover new genes and compounds that alter biofilm morphology and prevent the formation of problematic biofilms. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex processes that shape the surface morphology of biofilms and highlights the importance of mechanical forces in morphogenesis.
Summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the mechanisms behind the development of epileptic neuronal networks following severe seizures. A key player in this process is the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF), a transcription factor that influences neuronal phenotype. Recent studies have shown that interfering with NRSF function can attenuate the development of epilepsy.

     In a new study, researchers investigated the role of NRSF in epileptogenesis, the process by which seizures lead to the formation of abnormal neuronal networks. They found that epilepsy-provoking seizures increased the levels of NRSF in the mature hippocampus, a region of the brain critical for memory and learning. However, surprisingly, this increase in NRSF levels led to the repression of only a small subset of potential NRSF target genes.

     The researchers used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. They discovered that the subset of genes repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, making them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels. This selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a crucial role in influencing neuronal properties in both pathological and physiological contexts.

     The study found that the subset of genes repressed by NRSF included ion channels, receptors, and other crucial contributors to neuronal function. These genes were preferentially repressed by NRSF in mature hippocampus and were rescued when NRSF binding was prevented. The repression of these genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy.

     The key findings of this study are that NRSF contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating a group of genes that critically influence neuronal function, and that only a small subset of potential NRSF target genes are actually repressed by the transcription factor in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy. The study highlights the importance of dynamic, selective regulation of NRSF target genes in influencing neuronal properties in both pathological and physiological contexts.
Summary
     The mammalian olfactory system uses parallel pathways to process sensory information, but the mechanisms behind this processing are not well understood. The olfactory bulb contains two types of projection neurons, mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs), which receive input from olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs). Research has shown that MCs and TCs respond differently to odors, but the reasons behind these differences are unclear.

     A recent study investigated the parallel pathways formed by MCs and TCs in mice and found that distinct lateral inhibitory circuits drive the processing of sensory information in these pathways. Lateral inhibition is a mechanism where one neuron suppresses the activity of another neuron. The study found that MCs and TCs have different levels of activity-dependent lateral inhibition, which is influenced by the activation of deep and superficial granule cells.

     The researchers used simulations to show that these circuit-level differences allow MCs and TCs to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges. This suggests that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways. In other words, MCs and TCs may be specialized to process odors at different concentrations.

     The study also found that the combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables TCs and MCs to collectively encode odors better than either population alone. This supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms behind parallel processing in the olfactory system and may have implications for our understanding of other sensory systems, such as the visual system.

     The research suggests that the differences in odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs emerge due to differences in connectivity to OSNs and external tufted cells. This is similar to the mechanisms behind feature selectivity in the retina, where different ganglion cell types are connected to specific bipolar and amacrine cell types. The study's findings highlight the importance of understanding the local circuits that support feature selectivity in parallel streams, particularly in brain areas where distinct outputs are generated from initially homogeneous sources.
Summary
     The M2 muscarinic receptor is a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that plays a crucial role in various physiological processes. Allosteric modulation, where a molecule binds to a site other than the primary binding site, affects the receptor's activity. However, the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allosteric effects in GPCRs, including the M2 muscarinic receptor, are not well understood.

     Researchers compared monomers (single units) and oligomers (multiple units) of the M2 muscarinic receptor to identify the allosteric properties gained in oligomers. They used a FRET-based sensor to monitor allosteric interactions and pharmacological assays to examine the effects of allosteric ligands. Molecular dynamics simulations were also used to examine the atomic-level determinants of allostery.

     The study found that allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative, resulting from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. In contrast, allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending on the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

     The M2 muscarinic receptor has been a prototype for studying allosteric effects in GPCRs. Previous studies have focused on the interaction of allosteric ligands with the allosteric site, measured by modulating events at the orthosteric site. However, these studies have been based on receptors in native membranes or detergent-solubilized extracts, which may not accurately reflect the behavior of oligomers.

     The researchers used molecular dynamics simulations to examine the atomic-level determinants of allostery in the M2 muscarinic receptor. They started with the crystal structure of the monomeric M2 receptor occupied by the agonist iperoxo (4MQS) and removed the ligand and accessory proteins. Conformations of the receptor were sampled from a canonical ensemble accessible within a period of 30 ns.

     The study provides new insights into the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allosteric effects in GPCRs, including the M2 muscarinic receptor. The findings have implications for understanding the complex behavior of oligomers and the design of allosteric modulators for therapeutic applications.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a crucial role for the enzyme SETD2 in the body's response to DNA damage. SETD2 is a histone-modifying enzyme that adds a specific chemical tag to histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36me3). This tag is essential for the proper functioning of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which helps repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs).

     The study found that SETD2 is necessary for the activation of the ATM protein, a key player in the DDR pathway. When SETD2 is depleted, ATM activation is impaired, leading to delayed recruitment of the 53BP1 protein to sites of DNA damage. Additionally, SETD2 is required for the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments, which are essential for homologous recombination repair of DSBs.

     The researchers also investigated the role of SETD2 in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), a type of cancer where SETD2 mutations have been found. They found that SETD2-mutant ccRCC cells displayed impaired DNA damage signaling and failed to activate the p53 protein, a master guardian of the genome. Despite the persistence of DNA lesions, SETD2-deficient cells showed decreased cell survival after DNA damage.

     The study reveals a novel role for SETD2 in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage. Unlike other histone modifications that promote the DDR, SETD2 does not increase H3K36me3 levels at DNA damage sites or recruit SETD2 to DSBs. Instead, SETD2 acts as a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs.

     The researchers propose that the loss of SETD2 in ccRCC may provide an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the mechanistic basis of the SETD2 impact on the DDR. The findings of this study provide new insights into the impact of altered chromatin states on the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity.
Summary
     A recent study has identified a new mutation in the Rasgrp1 gene, known as Rasgrp1Anaef, which leads to the production of anti-nuclear autoantibodies and the accumulation of a specific type of T cell in mice. The mutation affects the EF-hand domain of the Rasgrp1 protein, a key regulator of the Ras/ERK signaling pathway. In mice with the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation, the Ras/ERK signaling pathway is less active in vitro, but surprisingly, thymocyte selection is mostly normal in vivo. However, the mutation causes an overexpression of the CD44 protein on naive T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner.

     Further investigation revealed that the Rasgrp1Anaef mutation leads to elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling in naive CD4+ T cells. The mTOR pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism, and its overactivation is associated with various diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. The study found that the accumulation of Helios+ PD-1+ T cells and the production of autoantibodies in Rasgrp1Anaef mice are dependent on B cells and are normalized in mice with a reduction-of-function mutation in the Mtor gene.

     The researchers identified CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 signaling and found that CD44 expression, CD4+ T cell subset ratios, and serum autoantibodies all returned to normal in Rasgrp1AnaefMtorchino double-mutant mice. This suggests that increased mTOR activity is essential for the Rasgrp1Anaef T cell dysregulation. The study reveals a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells and dissociates this function from its well-known role in thymic positive selection. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases and highlight the importance of mTOR signaling in T cell regulation.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long known that mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family are common in cancer. However, the exact mechanisms by which these mutations contribute to tumorigenesis are not well understood. A recent study aimed to investigate the role of Arid1a, a subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation.

     The study used a mouse model to suppress Arid1a in the pancreas of adult mice with oncogenic Kras mutations. The results showed that Arid1a suppression led to rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC precursor lesions. This suggests that Arid1a acts as a barrier to Kras-driven acinar to ductal metaplasia and early-stage pancreatic neoplasia.

     In contrast, when Arid1a was suppressed during embryogenesis, concurrent with Kras activation, acinar cell fate was retained. This indicates that the timing and genetic context play a crucial role in the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

     The study also explored the mechanism by which Arid1a regulates pancreas cell identity. The results suggest that Arid1a disruption reduces the chromatin accessibility of key transcription factors to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate. This implies that genomic areas rendered accessible by Arid1a harbor elements involved in preventing acinar to duct-like trans-differentiation in the context of mutant Kras.

     Furthermore, the study found that acute loss of Arid1a in the setting of a pre-existing Kras mutation rapidly perturbs the identity and function of pancreatic acinar cells, enhancing their sensitivity to metaplastic and PanIN-inducing signals stemming from oncogenic Kras.

     Overall, the study demonstrates that Arid1a is a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and highlights the importance of timing and genetic context in the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis. The findings suggest that Arid1a acts as a barrier to Kras-driven acinar to ductal metaplasia and early-stage pancreatic neoplasia, and that other factors are necessary to promote the PanIN-to-PDAC transition.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that social networks play a crucial role in buffering the effects of stress in many species. However, the absence of a social network can also be stressful. A recent study examined how social isolation affects the brain's response to stress in mice. The study found that social isolation has sex-specific effects on the brain's response to stress.

     The study focused on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is responsible for the body's response to stress. Specifically, the researchers looked at the activity of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. CRH neurons play a key role in launching the body's stress response.

     The study found that social isolation for less than 24 hours increased the first spike latency (FSL) and decreased the excitability of CRH neurons in female mice, but not in male mice. FSL is a measure of how long it takes for a neuron to fire in response to a stimulus. Increased FSL indicates a decrease in neuronal excitability. The study also found that the effects of social isolation on CRH neurons were blocked by a glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone.

     In contrast, acute physical stress, such as swimming, increased FSL in both male and female mice. However, social isolation occluded the effects of acute physical stress on FSL in female mice, but not in male mice. This suggests that social isolation and acute physical stress have different effects on the brain's response to stress in males and females.

     The study's findings demonstrate that social isolation has sex-specific effects on the brain's response to stress. The results suggest that female mice may interpret social isolation as a stress, leading to changes in the activity of CRH neurons. In contrast, male mice do not respond to social isolation in the same way. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how social isolation affects the brain's response to stress and may have implications for the development of treatments for stress-related disorders.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the protein hemoglobin (Hb) plays a crucial role in delivering oxygen to tissues in the body. However, the exact mechanisms behind how Hb adapts to the needs of different tissues and body sizes have remained unclear. A recent study has shed new light on this process, revealing that both the affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb are key factors in optimizing tissue oxygen delivery.

     The researchers used a mathematical model to analyze the relationship between the Hill coefficient (a measure of cooperativity) and the relative affinity and conformational changes of Hb. They found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a "biophysical Hill landscape" that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading. This means that Hb can adjust its oxygen delivery to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of different tissues.

     The study also found that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply. For example, Hb in small-sized animals with high metabolic rates has lower affinity for oxygen than Hb in large-sized animals. This suggests that Hb has evolved to adapt to the needs of different body sizes and metabolic rates.

     The researchers also examined the relationship between metabolic rate and Hb affinity in humans. They found that as metabolic rate increases, the maximum Hill cooperativity value of oxygen binding by Hb also increases. Conversely, they found an inverse linear correlation between metabolic rate and Hb affinity. This means that as metabolic rate increases, Hb affinity decreases, allowing for more efficient oxygen delivery to tissues.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying body-size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. The findings suggest that both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb are critical factors in optimizing tissue oxygen delivery, and that Hb has evolved to adapt to the needs of different body sizes and metabolic rates. These results have important implications for our understanding of how Hb functions in different physiological contexts.
Summary
     Malaria starts when a mosquito injects Plasmodium sporozoites into the skin of a mammalian host. To infect the host, the sporozoites must locate and enter a blood vessel. However, the process of how they do this is not well understood. A recent study used intravital microscopy in mice to examine sporozoite motility and their interaction with dermal blood vessels.

     The study found that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: 'avascular motility' and 'perivascular motility'. Avascular motility occurs when sporozoites are far from blood vessels and is characterized by high speed and less confinement. In contrast, perivascular motility occurs when sporozoites are near blood vessels and is more constrained. The study also found that the curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries.

     The study used mutant sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins to highlight the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site. The results suggest that the gliding motility of Plasmodium sporozoites is essential for their infectivity. The study also found that mutant sporozoites that display modest changes in motility pattern or speed have dramatic decreases in blood vessel invasion and infectivity.

     The study provides new insights into how Plasmodium sporozoites navigate through and out of the dermis. The results suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene. The study's findings have implications for the development of new malaria treatments that target the early stages of infection.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that cells are organized into functional modules, which are groups of proteins that work together to perform specific tasks. These modules are crucial for cell function, but they are not always the same across different species. In fact, cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. A recent study investigated how cells adapt to the loss of a key protein called BEM1, which is important for cell polarization in yeast cells. The researchers deleted the BEM1 gene in yeast cells and allowed them to evolve over 1,000 generations. They found that the cells quickly adapted to the loss of BEM1 and eventually reached a fitness level similar to that of cells with the BEM1 gene.

     To understand how the cells adapted, the researchers sequenced their genomes and monitored their polarization. They found that the cells followed a common evolutionary trajectory, with a series of adaptive mutations that improved cell polarization. These mutations inactivated proteins that were not essential for cell function, allowing the cells to recover from the loss of BEM1. The researchers also found that the cells developed multiple polarity sites, suggesting that the positive feedback that ensures a single site of polarization is weaker.

     The study suggests that cells can be robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions. This means that cells can adapt to strong selective pressure by removing components from modules rather than quantitatively altering their properties. The researchers interpret their results as demonstrating that the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately also make it possible for them to adapt to strong perturbations. Overall, the study provides new insights into how cells adapt to the loss of key proteins and how they can evolve to perform the same functions with different proteins.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding how people make economic decisions, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. These decisions often have lasting consequences, but the neural mechanisms behind them are not well understood. To investigate this, researchers designed a task where participants made decisions about whether to accept or reject prospects that provided financial returns. The goal was to see how the brain processes these decisions, particularly in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region involved in reward and decision-making.

The study found that the mPFC, specifically the rostral part (rmPFC), encoded the value of a prospect only when the decision to accept or reject it was delayed. This suggests that the rmPFC plays a role in integrating value signals over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded the value of a prospect only when it was rejected or when the decision to accept it was deferred. The dACC signals also reflected two biases that influenced the participants' decisions: a tendency to delay commitments and a tendency to weigh potential losses more heavily than gains.

These findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms of economic decision-making. The rmPFC's role in integrating value signals over time suggests that it helps people make decisions based on long-term consequences, rather than just short-term gains. The dACC's role in encoding value when a prospect is rejected or deferred suggests that it helps people avoid potential losses and make more cautious decisions.

The study's results also highlight the complexity of economic decision-making. While the rmPFC and dACC are both involved in value encoding, they do so in different ways. The rmPFC is more focused on the long-term consequences of a decision, while the dACC is more focused on avoiding potential losses. These findings have implications for our understanding of how people make economic decisions and how these decisions are influenced by neural mechanisms in the brain.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, plays a crucial role in regulating various physiological processes, including gene expression. However, the exact mechanisms behind this regulation are not yet fully understood. A recent study has shed new light on this process by investigating the role of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies that form around long non-coding RNA and RNA-binding proteins, in controlling gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.

     The study found that paraspeckles in pituitary cells display a circadian expression pattern, meaning their formation and activity follow a daily rhythm. The researchers also discovered that the insertion of specific sequences, known as IRAlu, into the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of a gene can lead to a rhythmic circadian retention of the corresponding mRNA in the nucleus. This retention is lost when paraspeckles are disrupted, suggesting that paraspeckles play a crucial role in controlling circadian gene expression.

     The study used real-time video-microscopy to observe the expression of a green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in cells with IRAlu inserted into their 3' UTR. The results showed that the EGFP protein was expressed in a circadian pattern, indicating that the IRAlu sequences were driving the rhythmic expression of the gene. In contrast, the insertion of a single antisense Alu sequence had only a weak effect on EGFP expression.

     The researchers also found that four major proteins and the long non-coding RNA Neat1, which are components of paraspeckles, display a circadian expression pattern in pituitary cells. This suggests that paraspeckles may play a key role in controlling circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by rhythmically retaining mRNAs in the nucleus.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of circadian gene expression and highlight the importance of paraspeckles in regulating gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of paraspeckles in controlling circadian rhythms and their potential implications for human health and disease.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long understood the importance of presynaptic calcium channels in converting electrical signals into chemical communication between neurons. However, the specific molecules in the active zone of the synapse that control this process have remained poorly understood. A recent study has shed light on the role of Munc13, a protein essential for exocytosis, in controlling the function of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs).

     The study found that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs through a specific region of the protein called the C2B domain. This interaction is critical for controlling the behavior of VGCCs during various forms of activity, including high-frequency action potential bursts and single action potential stimuli. The researchers demonstrated that eliminating this interaction by removing Munc13 or replacing it with a mutant version of the protein altered the response of VGCCs to these stimuli.

     The study's findings suggest that Munc13 plays a key role in controlling the use-dependence of VGCCs, which is the ability of the channels to respond to repeated stimuli. The researchers showed that Munc13 enhances calcium influx and modulates the kinetic properties of VGCCs across a range of stimulation conditions. This modulation is thought to be mediated by a direct interaction between Munc13 and VGCCs.

     To further investigate the significance of the Munc13-VGCC interaction, the researchers examined the impact of removing Munc13 on action potential-driven calcium influx in nerve terminals. They found that eliminating Munc13 resulted in a complete block of exocytosis, which is the process by which neurotransmitters are released from the neuron. The study's results suggest that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis.

     The study's findings have broad implications for understanding how synaptic transmission is controlled. The researchers suggest that the interaction between Munc13 and VGCCs is a novel form of synaptic modulation that can be used to actively control synaptic throughput. This could have important implications for the development of new treatments for neurological disorders, such as epilepsy and Parkinson's disease, which are characterized by abnormal synaptic transmission.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the intricate shapes of plant cells, particularly the puzzle-shaped cells found in the epidermis of many plant species. These cells, characterized by their lobes and indentations, have been observed in various plant organs, including leaves, cotyledons, and fruit pods. However, the functional benefit of these complex cell shapes has remained unclear.

     Researchers propose that the puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of plants have evolved to mitigate mechanical stress caused by turgor pressure. Turgor pressure is the force exerted by water within plant cells, which can reach up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells and 50 bar in specialized cells like stomata. When plant tissues grow isotropically, meaning they expand equally in all directions, cells can become large and open, leading to increased stress on the cell wall.

     To test this hypothesis, the researchers analyzed the stress in a mechanical model of the cotyledon epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that puzzle-shaped cells with lobes and indentations can effectively reduce mechanical stress by preventing the formation of large open areas in the cell. This is particularly important in isodiametric organs like broad leaves, cotyledons, and silicle fruit pods, where cells cannot simply elongate like they can in stems, roots, and siliques.

     The researchers also used simulation models to show that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress can plausibly reproduce the development of epidermal cell shape. Their results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis in plants. In other words, the shape of plant cells is influenced by the mechanical forces acting on them, particularly turgor pressure.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the evolution of plant cell shape and its relationship to mechanical stress. The researchers propose that the puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of plants are an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces acting on turgid plant cells. This discovery has implications for our understanding of plant development and the evolution of complex cell shapes in plants.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that human genes contain non-coding regions called introns and coding regions called exons. To create a functional gene, these introns and exons must be properly connected by a process called splicing. Splicing involves the assembly of a complex called a spliceosome, which is made up of multiple subunits. However, the exact mechanisms behind spliceosome assembly, particularly how introns and exons interact, have been unclear.

     Researchers used a technique called CoSMoS to study the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on individual pre-mRNA molecules in human cell extracts. They found that the binding of a subunit called U1 to the 5' splice site of an intron can work together with the binding of U1 to the 5' splice site of the next intron to increase the rate and efficiency of U2 subunit recruitment to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. This synergy between 5' splice sites across introns and exons is thought to be important for the correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.

     The study also revealed that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5' splice site are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream or upstream of the 5' splice site. This suggests that pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways: cross-intron interactions or cross-exon interactions. Cross-intron interactions involve the direct recognition of an intron, while cross-exon interactions involve the definition of exons flanking an intron, followed by cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of spliceosome assembly and suggest that the collaboration between flanking 5' splice sites is a major contributor to exon inclusion. This collaboration dramatically increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-spliceosome formation, highlighting the importance of this process in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a new way that cells help certain proteins fold into their correct shape. This process, called the ubiquitin-dependent folding system, occurs on the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a type of cell membrane. The ER is like a factory where proteins are made and processed before being sent out to do their jobs in the cell.

     The researchers focused on a protein called LRP6, which is involved in a signaling pathway that helps cells grow and divide. LRP6 is a membrane protein, meaning it is embedded in the cell membrane, and it has a hard time folding into its correct shape on its own. To help LRP6 fold, the cell attaches a small molecule called ubiquitin to a specific part of the protein. This ubiquitin tag acts like a chaperone, giving LRP6 time to fold into its correct shape.

     If LRP6 successfully folds, the ubiquitin tag is removed by an enzyme called USP19, and the protein is sent out of the ER. However, if LRP6 fails to fold, it is tagged with multiple ubiquitin molecules and sent to a part of the cell called the proteasome, where it is broken down.

     This ubiquitin-dependent folding system is not unique to LRP6. The researchers found that it also helps other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and the anthrax toxin receptor 2, which are involved in severe human diseases. These proteins are poor folders, meaning they have a hard time folding into their correct shape on their own.

     The discovery of this ubiquitin-dependent folding system provides new insights into how cells process and regulate membrane proteins. It also highlights the importance of proper protein folding in maintaining cellular health and preventing disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of this system and its implications for human health.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that sex differences in cognitive processes can contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders. A recent study investigated sex differences in learning and decision-making in mice using a classic value-based decision-making task called the restless two-armed bandit. The study found that male and female mice had similar accuracy in the task, but they achieved this performance through different patterns of exploration.

     Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, often getting "stuck" in exploration once they started. In contrast, female mice explored less but learned more quickly during exploration. These results suggest that sex exerts a stronger influence on decision-making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices.

     The study used computational tools to uncover latent variables that define different decision-making approaches in the mice. The results showed significant sex differences in exploration and rate of learning. The researchers also found that female mice were more likely to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial, known as win-stay behaviors.

     The study's findings have implications for understanding sex differences in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as addiction, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. Exploration during decision-making is altered in these conditions, and the neural mechanisms of exploration are a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to these diagnoses. The study's results suggest that sex differences in exploration and learning may contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to these disorders.

     The researchers used a combination of computational modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore/exploit task. While males and females had similar performance, they used different latent explore-exploit strategies to learn about the dynamic environment. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering sex differences in cognitive processes, particularly during periods of learning and exploration, to better understand individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how proteins embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are extracted and degraded. This process, known as ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), is crucial for maintaining cellular health by removing misfolded or damaged proteins. A key step in ERAD is the movement of hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytosol, often accompanied by hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts.

     A team of researchers used a reconstituted system with purified proteins from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate this process. They found that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10, also known as Teb-4/MARCH6 in animals, acts as a retrotranslocase that facilitates the extraction of membrane proteins. The TM segment of a substrate protein interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10, allowing it to passively move into the aqueous phase. Meanwhile, the luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, with their unfolding occurring on the luminal side of the membrane due to the action of the cytoplasmic Cdc48 ATPase.

     This study provides new insights into the mechanism of ERAD, revealing how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains. The findings have implications for our understanding of protein quality control pathways in the ER and other organelles, such as the Golgi, mitochondria, and chloroplasts, where membrane proteins are removed from the organelle for proteasomal degradation in the cytosol. The discovery of Doa10's role as a retrotranslocase sheds light on the complex process of ERAD and its importance in maintaining cellular homeostasis.

Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how pain signals are processed in the spinal cord, particularly in the dorsal horn, a critical area where sensory information is relayed. A recent study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR). The results show that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, directly relaying signals to lamina I projection neurons.

     The study found that photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in significant nocifensive behavior, which was sensitive to morphine and caused a conditioned place aversion. This suggests that CR neurons play a key role in the generation and amplification of pain signals. The researchers also found that inhibiting these interneurons using halorhodopsin elevated sensory thresholds, further supporting their role in pain processing.

     The study confirms that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal horn network that contributes to spinal pain signaling and can amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemically-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn positions them to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers. This capacity is demonstrated in the nocifensive responses elicited by spinal photostimulation.

     The study's findings are consistent with current models of dorsal horn microcircuitry, which place CR neurons in a polysynaptic circuit that signals through SOM neurons to activate lamina I projection neurons and initiate pain signaling. However, the study's results also extend our understanding of excitatory interneurons in spinal sensory processing, suggesting that they play a more significant role than previously thought in linking low-threshold modality (innocuous) tactile input to excite more dorsal nociceptive circuitry.

     Overall, the study identifies CR neurons as a potential target for future analgesic therapies and highlights the importance of understanding the complex neural circuits involved in pain processing. Further research is needed to determine how these circuits respond during peripherally evoked sensory processing and how they contribute to both acute and chronic pain states.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called RAB23 in the development of bones in the skull. RAB23 is a protein that helps regulate the growth and formation of bones, and mutations in the gene that encodes RAB23 have been linked to a rare genetic disorder called Carpenter Syndrome. People with Carpenter Syndrome often have extra fingers and toes, as well as problems with the shape of their skull.

     To understand how RAB23 works, the researchers created mice that were missing the RAB23 gene. These mice developed similar problems to those seen in people with Carpenter Syndrome, including extra fingers and toes and premature fusion of the bones in the skull. The researchers found that the mice had an overactive signaling pathway called FGF10-pERK1/2, which is involved in the growth and development of bones. This overactivity led to an imbalance in other signaling pathways, including the Hedgehog pathway, which is also important for bone development.

     The researchers found that RAB23 acts as a brake on the FGF10-pERK1/2 pathway, preventing it from becoming overactive. They also found that RAB23 helps to regulate the activity of another protein called GLI1, which is involved in the Hedgehog pathway. By inhibiting the FGF10-pERK1/2 pathway, RAB23 helps to prevent the premature fusion of bones in the skull.

     The researchers were able to show that inhibiting the FGF10-pERK1/2 pathway in the mice restored normal bone development and prevented the premature fusion of bones in the skull. This suggests that RAB23 plays a critical role in regulating the growth and development of bones in the skull, and that mutations in the RAB23 gene may contribute to the development of Carpenter Syndrome. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying bone development and may have implications for the treatment of skeletal disorders.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that cells can "remember" past events, such as environmental or developmental cues, through the inheritance of gene expression states. A key player in this process is the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. However, it has remained unclear whether this inheritance is directed by the local chromatin environment of individual genes (cis memory) or by the concentrations of diffusible factors (trans memory).

     To address this question, researchers studied the Polycomb target gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) in Arabidopsis plants. FLC is a key regulator of flowering time, and its expression is repressed by PRC2. By monitoring the expression of two copies of FLC in the same plants, the researchers found that one copy could be repressed while the other was active. This "mixed" expression state was inherited through many cell divisions as the plants developed, demonstrating that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored in the local chromatin environment of the gene, rather than in the concentrations of diffusible factors.

     The researchers used a classic epigenetic process called vernalization to study FLC expression. Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure, and it is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of FLC. The researchers found that the repression of FLC was independent of DNA methylation, making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene.

     The study provides evidence that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene can instruct its own inheritance and constitutes a cis memory system. This challenges the idea that epigenetic memory is stored in the concentrations of diffusible factors, and instead suggests that local chromatin states play a key role in the inheritance of gene expression states. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells remember past events and how this information is passed on to daughter cells.
BiP, a chaperone protein found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), plays a crucial role in helping other proteins fold correctly. However, the structure and function of BiP oligomers, which are formed when multiple BiP molecules come together, have been poorly understood. To investigate this, researchers used techniques such as site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking to study the architecture of BiP oligomers.

The results showed that BiP oligomers consist of adjacent protomers that engage the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another, which attenuates the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. This means that when BiP forms oligomers, its ability to help other proteins fold is reduced. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapid and reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers, indicating that the cell can quickly adjust the amount of BiP oligomers in response to changes in unfolded protein load.

The researchers also found that lumenal ER calcium depletion causes rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding. This suggests that the oligomers are relatively inert and do not contribute much to the cell's ability to fold proteins. Instead, the cell relies on the conversion between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load.

The study's findings are consistent with a model where competition between oligomerization and substrate binding helps to buffer the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load. The researchers propose that BiP may favor itself as a client (oligomerizing) over other clients when ER calcium levels decline. This would shift the equilibrium between unfolded proteins and active chaperones in favor of the former.

The study provides new insights into the physiological modulation of BiP activity and its role in responding to changes in unfolded protein load. The findings have implications for our understanding of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the heat shock response, which are critical for maintaining protein homeostasis in the cell. The study also highlights the importance of exploring the relationship between unfolded protein load and the oligomeric state of Hsp70 chaperones, which is confounded by powerful feedback mechanisms that dominate the unfolded protein responses.
Summary
     Biologists have determined the near-atomic structure of a plant virus called Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) using a technique called electron cryomicroscopy. PepMV is a type of flexible filamentous virus that affects plants and can cause significant economic losses in agriculture. The researchers found that the coat protein (CP) of PepMV is similar in structure to the nucleoproteins (NPs) of a group of animal viruses called phleboviruses. These animal viruses have a segmented single-stranded RNA genome and are enveloped in a protein shell.

     The CP of PepMV and the NPs of phleboviruses have a similar overall fold, but differ in their C-terminal extensions. The C-terminal extensions determine the characteristics of the multimeric assemblies of these proteins, with PepMV forming a helical rod and phleboviruses forming a loose ribonucleoprotein. The similarity between the CP of PepMV and the NPs of phleboviruses suggests that there may have been gene transfer between eukaryotic single-stranded RNA viruses with positive and negative polarity.

     Flexible filamentous viruses, including PepMV, are non-enveloped and contain hundreds of copies of the CP arranged in a helical fashion to protect a single-stranded RNA genome. The high-resolution structures of these viruses have only been determined for representatives of the genus Potexvirus, which includes PepMV. The researchers were unable to confirm whether other families of flexible filamentous viruses have a similar fold in their CPs.

     The discovery of the similarity between the CP of PepMV and the NPs of phleboviruses has significant implications for our understanding of the evolution and diversity of viruses. It suggests that there may have been gene transfer between eukaryotic single-stranded RNA viruses with positive and negative polarity, and highlights the importance of further research into the relationships between different virus families.
Scientists have developed a new method to precisely locate the binding sites of antibodies on the surface of cells. This is important because the location of an antibody's binding site determines how it interacts with the cell and can affect the outcome of an immune response. Current methods for identifying binding sites are time-consuming, expensive, and not well-suited for high-throughput analysis.

The new method, called SiteLoc, uses a technique called topological image averaging to achieve nanometer-scale resolution. It works by measuring the distance between a bound ligand (such as an antibody) and a reference surface on the cell. This is done by analyzing high-resolution images of the cell surface.

Unlike other methods, SiteLoc can be used on cells with irregular shapes, which is common in nature. It can also be applied to other molecular distance estimations, not just antibody binding sites. The researchers tested SiteLoc on bacterial cells and found that it accurately estimated the location of the antibody binding site on the M protein.

The location of the binding site is crucial for understanding how antibodies interact with cells and for developing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. SiteLoc is a fast and efficient method that can be used for high-throughput analysis, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field. The method has the potential to improve our understanding of immune responses and aid in the development of new treatments.

SiteLoc works by reducing the dimensionality of the surface data within an image plane, allowing for nanometer-scale precision. This is achieved by calculating the average distance between the ligand channel and a reference signal channel using the averaged fluorescent signal along a cell contour. The method has been shown to accurately estimate molecular heights on both spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces.

The researchers used SiteLoc to locate the binding site of a non-specific monoclonal IgG antibody (Xolair) on the M protein of bacterial cells. The results agreed well with previously reported data, demonstrating the accuracy of the method. SiteLoc has the potential to be a valuable tool for researchers studying immune responses and developing new treatments.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how the body adapts to low oxygen levels, or hypoxia. A key aspect of this adaptation is the regulation of blood pressure, which is controlled by various factors, including peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds. Peripheral resistance refers to the narrowing or widening of blood vessels in response to changes in oxygen levels. However, the relationship between central control of blood flow and peripheral resistance is not yet fully understood.

     A recent study investigated the role of peripheral resistance in the skin, a large vascular bed, in response to hypoxia. The researchers used mice to examine how the skin's response to low oxygen levels affects the body's overall cardiovascular response. They found that the skin's response to hypoxia has a significant impact on heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.

     The study focused on the role of HIF (hypoxia-inducible factor) transcription factors, which are proteins that respond to low oxygen levels. HIF-1α and HIF-2α are two types of HIF transcription factors that play a crucial role in the skin's response to hypoxia. The researchers found that mice lacking HIF-1α and HIF-2α in their skin showed significant changes in blood pressure and body temperature compared to control mice.

     The study also proposed a model for how the skin responds to hypoxia. According to this model, low oxygen levels trigger an increase in HIF-1α, which leads to an increase in nitric oxide production, causing blood vessels to dilate and increase blood flow. However, as hypoxia persists, HIF-2α is activated, leading to a reduction in intracellular L-arginine, which causes blood vessels to constrict and reduce blood flow.

     The findings of this study demonstrate that peripheral tissues, such as the skin, play a crucial role in the body's response to hypoxia. The skin's response to low oxygen levels has a significant impact on cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature. This study provides new insights into the complex relationship between central control of blood flow and peripheral resistance, and highlights the importance of considering the role of peripheral tissues in the body's response to hypoxia.
Scientists have developed a new method to map the connections between individual neurons in the brain with high precision. This technique uses a light-sensitive protein called channelrhodopsin (ChR2) to activate specific neurons, allowing researchers to study how they communicate with each other. However, previous methods using ChR2 had limitations, as the light used to activate the protein could also stimulate nearby neurons, making it difficult to determine which connections were real and which were not.

     To overcome this issue, researchers used a technique called temporal focusing to expand the light beam in the imaging plane, allowing them to target specific areas of the neuron, such as the soma (the cell body) and proximal dendrites (branching extensions of the cell). By restricting ChR2 expression to these areas, they were able to reliably evoke action potentials (the electrical signals that neurons use to communicate) in individual neurons.

     The researchers used a calcium-sensitive protein called GCaMP6s to verify that the neurons were indeed generating action potentials. They also used patch-clamp electrophysiology to record the electrical activity of the neurons and determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections. This approach allowed them to map the connections between individual neurons with single-cell resolution, providing a more accurate picture of neural circuits.

     The ability to map neural circuits with single-cell resolution is crucial for understanding how the brain processes sensory information and generates behavioral responses. By studying the precise patterns of connectivity among different types of neurons, researchers can gain insights into circuit function and develop new treatments for neurological disorders. This new method has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of neural circuits and may lead to breakthroughs in fields such as neuroscience, neurology, and psychiatry.
Summary
     Biologists have long debated how transcription factors (TFs), such as Sox2 and Oct4, interact with DNA in eukaryotic cells. Recent single-molecule data suggested that Sox2 and Oct4 assemble on DNA in an ordered manner. However, a new analysis reveals that the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4 is actually driven by negative reciprocity. This means that the expression of Sox2 increases the binding of Oct4 to DNA, but the expression of Oct4 decreases the binding of Sox2.

     The researchers used a rigorous biophysical analysis to understand the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4. They found that the single-molecule data can be explained by a genomic-diversity model, which suggests that Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other's binding to DNA across the genome. This finding was unexpected and highlights the complexity of TF interactions on DNA.

     The study also suggests that the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4 may involve energy expenditure, which is not in thermodynamic equilibrium. This would mean that the binding of Sox2 and Oct4 to DNA is not random, but rather is influenced by an underlying energy source. Alternatively, the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4 may involve mixed cooperativity, where they help each other at some genomic loci and hinder each other at others.

     The results of this study have significant implications for our understanding of how TFs interact with DNA. They suggest that single-molecule data can provide more information than previously thought, and that the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4 is more complex than previously believed. The study also highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying TF interactions on DNA.

     The findings of this study were made possible by the use of single-molecule methods, which offer exciting capabilities for unraveling the mechanisms of TF interactions. The results of this study will need to be addressed in future studies to fully understand the implications of negative reciprocity and energy expenditure in the interaction between Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that animals can detect and respond to pathogens to prevent infection. However, this response comes at a cost to the animal's energy and resources. A new study in fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, has found that these insects can detect bacterial endotoxins, called lipopolysaccharides (LPS), before they become infected. The researchers discovered that the flies use their sense of taste, or gustation, to detect LPS and avoid it.

     The study found that the flies' gustatory neurons, which are responsible for detecting bitter tastes, express a protein called dTRPA1. When LPS is present, it activates the dTRPA1 channels in these neurons, triggering an aversive response in the flies. This means that the flies will avoid eating or laying eggs on surfaces contaminated with LPS. The researchers also found that blocking the dTRPA1 channels in the gustatory neurons prevented the flies from detecting and avoiding LPS.

     The study suggests that this gustatory mechanism is a conserved principle, meaning that it is shared across different species, including mammals. The researchers propose that this mechanism may be an important way for animals to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria, which are a common type of bacteria that can cause disease. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how animals detect and respond to pathogens, and may have potential applications in the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.

     The researchers used a combination of genetic and behavioral experiments to investigate the role of dTRPA1 in LPS detection. They found that flies that lacked the dTRPA1 gene were unable to detect and avoid LPS, while flies that expressed dTRPA1 were able to detect and avoid it. The researchers also found that LPS activates dTRPA1 channels in human cells, suggesting that this mechanism may be conserved across species.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which animals detect and respond to pathogens, and highlights the importance of the gustatory system in this process. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of immune systems and may have potential applications in the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.
Summary
     Biologists have identified a protein called Zfp335 that plays a crucial role in the development of T cells, a type of immune system cell. T cells are essential for fighting off infections and diseases. The researchers found that mice with a mutated version of the Zfp335 gene, called Zfp335bloto, had a problem producing mature T cells. This problem started in the thymus, an organ where T cells mature, and continued after the T cells left the thymus.

     The researchers discovered that Zfp335 is a transcription factor, a type of protein that helps control the activity of other genes. They found that Zfp335 binds to specific regions of DNA and regulates the expression of certain genes involved in protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. One of these genes, called Ankle2, was found to be particularly important for T cell maturation. When the researchers restored Ankle2 expression in the mutant mice, it partially rescued the T cell maturation defect.

     The study suggests that Zfp335 is an essential regulator of late-stage T cell maturation in the thymus and after the T cells leave the thymus. The researchers found that the mutation in Zfp335 did not affect the selection of T cells in the thymus or their ability to proliferate. However, it did affect the viability of the T cells. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of T cell development and highlights the importance of Zfp335 in this process. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Zfp335 in the immune system.
Summary
     Biologists have long assumed that the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) in a cell directly correlates with the amount of protein produced. However, research has shown that this is not always the case. A team of scientists has discovered a new factor, called mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, which affects how efficiently mRNA is translated into protein. They found that many bacteria and archaea have evolved to avoid interactions between mRNA and non-coding RNA (ncRNA), which can interfere with protein production.

     The researchers created a new method to measure this avoidance, called extrinsic avoidance, and applied it to 97% of species. They found that most species have a reduced capacity for mRNA:ncRNA interactions compared to controls. By generating variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, the team demonstrated that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. This suggests that taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account can enable precise modulation of protein abundance.

     The study also found that there is strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. However, the complete avoidance of these interactions is unlikely due to the large number of potential interacting RNA species. Therefore, there may be a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression. The researchers predict that taking crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled.

     The team conducted a meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data and found that mRNAs with low avoidance values produce fewer proteins for each mRNA transcript than those with high avoidance. This suggests that mRNA:ncRNA avoidance is at least as good an explanation of variation in protein abundance as other factors such as codon usage and internal mRNA secondary structure. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of protein expression and highlights the importance of considering mRNA:ncRNA interactions in gene expression analysis.
summary
     Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of motor neurons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Researchers have long wondered whether the denervation of NMJs in ALS is a result of a global degeneration of motor neurons or a more complex process. To answer this question, scientists used in vivo imaging to study the dynamics of NMJs in a mouse model of ALS over a three-month period.

     The study found that single motor units, which are groups of motor neurons and their associated NMJs, are dismantled asynchronously in the mouse model of ALS. This means that the loss of NMJs does not occur simultaneously across the entire motor unit, but rather happens at different times in different parts of the unit. In fact, the study revealed that weeks before complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by new axonal sprouting, resulting in the formation of new synapses onto nearby NMJs.

     The researchers also found that denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, suggesting that factors extrinsic to motor neurons, such as neuromuscular factors, contribute to NMJ denervation. Furthermore, distal branches of the motor unit are more susceptible to denervation than proximal branches. These findings indicate that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation, rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration.

     The study's results have important implications for the development of therapeutic strategies for ALS. The researchers suggest that there is a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration, which could be exploited to prevent or slow the progression of the disease. However, the study also found that rescuing neuronal loss in SOD1 mice does not necessarily improve NMJ denervation, suggesting that local branch-specific events may play a key role in NMJ denervation. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex dynamics of NMJ denervation in ALS and highlights the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms of the disease.
Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the side effects of tamoxifen, a hormone therapy used to treat breast cancer. While tamoxifen improves survival rates, long-term treatment can lead to unpleasant symptoms such as hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. However, the specific tissues and cells responsible for these side effects have remained unclear due to a lack of suitable animal models.

     To address this knowledge gap, a recent study used mice to investigate the effects of tamoxifen on physiology. The researchers found that mice treated with tamoxifen exhibited changes in body temperature, bone density, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed widespread gene expression changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-POA) of the brain. These changes were dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), as conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus-POA abolished or reversed tamoxifen-induced gene expression.

     The study also found that ERα-deficient mice did not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in body temperature, bone density, or movement. This suggests that ERα plays a crucial role in mediating the physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice. The researchers further demonstrated that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for the tamoxifen-induced changes in gene expression and physiological effects.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicate that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice. Given the known roles of ERα in mediating various aspects of physiology, the study's results suggest that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health. The study's findings have implications for understanding the side effects of tamoxifen treatment in humans and may lead to the development of new therapies to mitigate these effects.
Summary
     ISG15, a protein produced in response to viral infections, has been found to play a crucial role in defending against bacterial infections as well. Researchers have discovered that ISG15 is dramatically induced in non-phagocytic cells when they are infected with Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning. This induction of ISG15 occurs independently of type I interferon, a protein that is typically involved in the immune response to viral infections.

     The study found that the induction of ISG15 is triggered by the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses the presence of bacterial DNA and sends a signal through a series of proteins called STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. ISG15 then modifies certain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, leading to an increase in the secretion of cytokines, which are proteins that help fight off infections.

     The researchers used a technique called stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC) to identify which proteins are modified by ISG15 during Listeria infection. They found that ISG15 modification of ER and Golgi proteins is responsible for the protective effect against Listeria infection.

     The study also showed that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection both in laboratory-grown cells and in animal models. This suggests that ISG15 plays a key role in the innate immune response, which is the body's first line of defense against infections.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of ISG15 in defending against bacterial infections and highlight its potential as a target for the development of new treatments against Listeria and other bacterial infections. The study's results also reinforce the idea that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response, which is essential for protecting the body against a wide range of pathogens.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers use a technique called single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, analyzing the large amounts of data produced by this method can be time-consuming and subjective. To address this issue, scientists have developed a new software called DeepFRET, which uses deep learning to rapidly and automatically classify smFRET data.

     DeepFRET is an open-source software that can analyze raw microscope images and output histograms of biomolecule behavior. The only human intervention required is setting a quality threshold for the data. The software integrates standard features of smFRET analysis and outputs common kinetic information metrics. In tests, DeepFRET achieved an accuracy of over 95% in classifying ground truth data, outperforming human operators and other commonly used methods.

     DeepFRET uses a pre-trained neural network to analyze the data, which allows it to recognize abstract patterns and learn useful features directly from the raw input data. This approach has several advantages over other methods, including the ability to operate without extensive data preprocessing or empirically defined rules, and the potential for reproducible and less opinionated evaluation of single-molecule data. Additionally, DeepFRET is significantly faster than human annotation for large single-molecule datasets.

     The software has been tested on real data and has demonstrated its capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics. The authors suggest that DeepFRET has the potential to contribute to benchmarking smFRET for dynamic structural biology and enable new fully automated analysis methodologies related to biomolecular recognition, protein folding, and dynamics. The software is available as a free-to-use standalone executable for both Windows and Mac users, making it accessible to end-users with limited programming skills. Overall, DeepFRET represents a significant advancement in the analysis of smFRET data and has the potential to increase the breadth and impact of single-molecule studies in structural biology.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that Polycomb repressive complex-1 (PRC1) plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by silencing certain genes. A protein called SCML2, a mammalian version of a protein found in fruit flies, is a key component of PRC1. Researchers have now discovered that SCML2 helps direct PRC1 to specific parts of the genome where it can silence genes.

     The study found that SCML2 binds to PRC1 through a specific region called the SPM domain and also interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel region called the RNA-binding region (RBR). This interaction between SCML2 and ncRNAs is necessary for SCML2 to be targeted to chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes.

     The researchers also found that SCML2 can silence genes on its own, without the help of PRC1, at a subset of genes. This suggests that SCML2 has a dual role in gene silencing: it can work with PRC1 to silence genes, but it can also silence genes independently.

     The study's findings provide new insights into how SCML2 and PRC1 work together to regulate gene expression. The researchers propose a model in which SCML2 is recruited to chromatin through its interaction with ncRNAs, where it then interacts with PRC1 to create a chromatin environment that is inhospitable to transcription.

     The study also highlights the importance of ncRNAs in regulating gene expression. Non-coding RNAs are often thought of as "junk" DNA, but they play a crucial role in many cellular processes, including gene regulation. The discovery that SCML2 binds to ncRNAs and uses this interaction to target PRC1 to specific parts of the genome sheds new light on the complex interplay between ncRNAs and epigenetic regulation.

     Overall, the study provides a deeper understanding of how SCML2 and PRC1 work together to regulate gene expression and highlights the importance of ncRNAs in this process. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells regulate gene expression and how this process goes awry in diseases such as cancer.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that ribosomes, the cellular machines responsible for protein synthesis, can be regulated to control gene expression. In the bacterium Escherichia coli, a protein called SecM plays a key role in this regulation by causing ribosomes to stall, or pause, during protein synthesis. This stalling is crucial for the proper functioning of the SecA-dependent secretion pathway, which is essential for the cell's survival.

     To understand how SecM causes ribosomes to stall, researchers used a powerful imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the structure of SecM-stalled ribosomes at near-atomic resolution. Their analysis revealed two distinct mechanisms by which SecM causes ribosomes to stall at different stages of the translation cycle. The first mechanism involves the inactivation of the ribosome's peptidyl-transferase center (PTC), which is responsible for forming peptide bonds between amino acids. The second mechanism involves the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site, which prevents the full-scale translocation of the tRNA molecule.

     The researchers found that the SecM protein interacts with the ribosome's exit tunnel, causing conformational changes in the PTC and leading to translation arrest. They also discovered that the position of the tRNA-nascent peptide linkage in SecM-stalled ribosomes is similar to that seen in active ribosomes, suggesting an alternative mechanism of stalling.

     These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SecM-dependent translational stalling and demonstrate how regulatory peptides like SecM can control the translation cycle by dynamically reshaping the functional center of the ribosome. The results also highlight the complexity and flexibility of the ribosome, which can be modulated by regulatory peptides to achieve precise control over gene expression.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers used a new imaging technique called Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to study the cone photoreceptors in the fovea, the part of the eye responsible for sharp vision, in 28 eyes of 16 people. They found that the density of cone photoreceptors in the fovea changes with the length of the eye. In longer eyes, the foveal cone mosaic is expanded, but not in proportion to the eye length. This means that even though the cones are farther apart in longer eyes, the angular sampling density, or the number of cones per degree of visual angle, is actually higher in myopes, or people with nearsightedness, compared to emmetropes, or people with normal vision. This could potentially explain why myopes often have better visual acuity, or sharpness of vision, than emmetropes, despite reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision.

     The researchers used a new generation of Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image the cone photoreceptors at and near the fovea in living eyes. They computed cone density and other metrics in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The study aimed to investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at and near the foveal center, which is the most important region for spatial vision but the most difficult to image due to the small size of photoreceptors.

     Previous studies have implicated retinal stretching as a possible cause of myopic visual deficits, but the structural changes at the foveal center during myopic progression were not well understood. The researchers found that myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes, despite retinal stretching. This suggests that the increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression may not be the main reason for visual deficits in myopes.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the relationship between eye length and visual acuity. The results suggest that myopes may have an advantage in terms of visual acuity due to the higher angular sampling density of cone photoreceptors in the fovea. This could potentially explain why myopes often achieve good visual acuity with optical correction, despite reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision.
Summary
     Scientists have long known that Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria, is a leading cause of serious illness in infants, particularly in low-income settings. To understand why some people carry the bacteria for longer periods than others, researchers developed a new model to analyze data from nasal swabs taken from individuals over time. By combining this data with genetic information from the bacteria, they found that genetic variations in the bacteria accounted for 63% of the differences in how long people carry the bacteria. This is a significant finding, as it suggests that the bacteria's genetic makeup plays a major role in determining how long it stays in the body.

     The researchers also identified specific genetic factors that contribute to the duration of carriage. They found that the type of bacteria (serotype) accounted for 17% of the variation, antibiotic resistance accounted for 9%, and other genetic factors accounted for 7%. Additionally, they discovered that certain sequences of genetic material called prophages were associated with shorter carriage duration, possibly by disrupting the bacteria's ability to take up new genetic material.

     These findings support theoretical models of how the bacteria compete with each other and how antibiotic resistance develops. The study also suggests that genetic variations in the bacteria can affect how long it stays in the body, which has implications for understanding how the bacteria spreads and how to develop effective treatments. The researchers note that their findings may not be generalizable to all populations, as environmental factors such as host vaccination status may influence the results.

     The study provides new insights into the genetic factors that contribute to the duration of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage and highlights the importance of considering the bacteria's genetic makeup in understanding its behavior. The findings have implications for the development of new treatments and strategies to prevent the spread of the bacteria.
Summary
     The slow delayed rectifier current (IKs) in the heart is crucial for stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration at high heart rates. This current is conducted by the tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel KCNQ1 and its β-subunit KCNE1. However, the stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been a topic of debate, with some studies suggesting a strict 2:4 ratio and others a variable ratio up to 4:4.

    To clarify this issue, researchers created fusion channels where KCNE1 was linked to one, two, or four KCNQ1 subunits. These channels were evaluated in mammalian cells using whole cell patch clamp, single-channel recordings, and UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid approaches. The results showed that channels with two or four KCNQ1 subunits linked to KCNE1 (EQQ and EQQQQ) had increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to channels with one KCNQ1 subunit linked to KCNE1 (EQ). These effects were abolished by the addition of KCNE1.

    Furthermore, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, the researchers found that EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates were progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, indicating that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex. This suggests that the flexibility in KCNQ1's β-subunits association allows for a powerful mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.

    The findings of this study demonstrate a KCNE1:KCNQ1 stoichiometry of up to 4:4, resolving the controversy surrounding the ratio of α and β-subunits in the IKs channel complex. This discovery has important implications for understanding the regulation of repolarization in the heart and may provide new insights into the development of treatments for cardiac arrhythmias.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the body's response to injury is crucial for complete tissue regeneration. However, the underlying processes of this response are not yet fully understood. A recent study in zebrafish has shed new light on the role of inflammation in tissue regeneration. The researchers found that a protein called interleukin-1 beta (Il1b) plays a double-edged role in the process. On the one hand, Il1b is necessary for tissue regeneration to occur. On the other hand, excessive levels of Il1b can actually impair regeneration.

     The study focused on the regeneration of the zebrafish fin fold, a process that involves the coordinated action of various cell types. The researchers found that Il1b is initially produced by epithelial cells in response to tissue injury. This triggers an inflammatory response, which is then resolved by macrophages, a type of immune cell. The study showed that the resolution of inflammation by macrophages is necessary for the survival of regenerative cells.

     The researchers also found that Il1b plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of genes involved in regeneration. In other words, Il1b helps to activate the expression of genes that are necessary for tissue regeneration to occur. However, if Il1b levels become too high, it can lead to apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in regenerative cells.

     The study suggests that a proper balance of Il1b signaling and inflammation is necessary for tissue regeneration to occur. This balance is tuned by macrophages, which help to resolve inflammation and prevent excessive Il1b production. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of tissue regeneration and could potentially inform the development of new therapies for human tissue repair and regeneration.
Summary
     The movement of proteins in the cytoplasm of cells may be limited by the properties of ribosomes, the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis. Researchers studied how the surface properties of proteins affect their movement in the cytoplasm of three types of bacteria: Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii. They found that proteins with a positive charge move much slower than those with a negative charge, with some proteins diffusing up to 100 times slower. This effect is weaker in Lactococcus lactis and Haloferax volcanii due to a phenomenon called electrostatic screening, which reduces the impact of charge on protein movement.

     The study suggests that the interaction between positively charged proteins and ribosomes is the main reason for the slowdown in diffusion. In vitro experiments with purified ribosomes confirmed this finding. The researchers propose that the properties of ribosomes may limit the types of proteins that can be present in the cytoplasm, a concept known as the cytoplasmic proteome. This idea raises a paradox in the functioning of prokaryotic symbionts, which are bacteria that live inside other cells.

     The study also found that the diffusion of proteins in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli depends on the distribution of charge over the protein surface, with proteins having a more even distribution of charge moving faster than those with a more uneven distribution. The researchers suggest that the binding of positively charged proteins to ribosomes may not only slow down their movement but also inhibit protein synthesis by affecting the assembly or activity of ribosomes.

     To understand the consequences of these findings, the researchers analyzed the proteomes of Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Haloferax volcanii, and four endosymbiotic bacteria. They found that the movement of proteins in the cytoplasm is influenced by the composition of the proteome, including the net charges and abundances of all proteome components. The study highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, in the functioning of biological cells, particularly in prokaryotes where active transport mechanisms are lacking.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the ability of some animals to regenerate lost body parts. Planarians, a type of flatworm, are one such animal that can regenerate its entire body from a small piece of tissue. However, the mechanisms that trigger this regenerative process are not well understood. A recent study has shed light on this mystery by identifying a protein called Smed-follistatin, which plays a crucial role in initiating regeneration in planarians.

     The researchers found that Smed-follistatin is required for planarians to respond to injuries that result in the absence of tissue. When Smed-follistatin is inhibited, the planarians are unable to regenerate the missing tissue. However, Smed-follistatin is not required for normal tissue turnover, which is the process of replacing old or damaged cells with new ones.

     The study also identified two other proteins, Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2, which are required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. These proteins are part of the TGF-β signaling pathway, which is a key regulator of cell growth and differentiation. The researchers found that Smed-follistatin inhibits the activity of Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2, which allows the planarians to initiate a regenerative response.

     The study also showed that Smed-follistatin is wound-induced, meaning that its expression increases in response to injury. The level of Smed-follistatin expression persists for a longer period after a major injury than after a simple injury, suggesting that it plays a critical role in the regenerative response.

     The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of regeneration in animals. Regeneration is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple cell types and signaling pathways. The identification of Smed-follistatin and its role in inhibiting Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2 provides new insights into the mechanisms that trigger regeneration. This knowledge could potentially be applied to the development of new treatments for human injuries and diseases.

     The study also highlights the importance of tissue absence in triggering a regenerative response. In planarians, injuries that result in the absence of tissue trigger a unique set of cellular and molecular responses that are distinct from those triggered by simple injuries. The researchers propose that wound-induced Smed-follistatin expression allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of regeneration in planarians and has important implications for our understanding of this complex process. The identification of Smed-follistatin and its role in inhibiting Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2 provides a key piece of the puzzle in understanding how animals regenerate lost body parts.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a unique pattern of genetic mutations in tumors that lack a specific repair mechanism called mismatch repair (MMR). This pattern, known as a mutation signature, is distinct from other types of tumors and is similar to the genetic variations found in normal human DNA. The study used advanced DNA sequencing techniques to analyze the genetic material of 33 tumors and their matched normal tissue samples. The results showed that MMR-deficient tumors have a significantly higher number of genetic mutations, with an average of 2015 somatic events per tumor, compared to 39 in MMR-proficient tumors.

     The researchers also found that the genetic mutations in MMR-deficient tumors are often in the form of insertions or deletions (indels) in repeated DNA sequences, known as microsatellites. These indels can be used as a marker to detect microsatellite instability (MSI), a characteristic of MMR-deficient tumors. The study developed a novel marker set that can detect MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than current standard tests.

     Furthermore, the researchers discovered that the indels in MMR-deficient tumors are enriched for a specific type of DNA repair mechanism called homologous recombination. As a result, MMR-deficient tumors are more sensitive to DNA double-strand breaks, which can be induced by certain chemicals or radiation. This sensitivity can be exploited as a therapeutic strategy to target MMR-deficient tumors.

     The study's findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors with MMR deficiency. The novel marker set developed in this study can help improve the detection of MSI, which is a key characteristic of MMR-deficient tumors. Additionally, the sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumors to DNA double-strand breaks may provide a new avenue for targeted therapy. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic characteristics of MMR-deficient tumors and highlights the potential for developing more effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for these tumors.
Summary
     Scientists have developed a new tool for controlling biological processes in cells using light. This tool, called "eMags," is an improved version of an existing system called Magnets. Magnets are small proteins that can be activated by light to bind together, allowing researchers to control specific cellular processes in a precise and non-invasive way.

     The original Magnets system had some limitations. It required the proteins to be linked together in a specific way, called concatemerization, and needed to be preincubated at a low temperature to work properly. To overcome these limitations, researchers engineered a new version of Magnets, called eMags, which do not require concatemerization or low-temperature preincubation.

     eMags are made up of two components, nMag and pMag, which are derived from a protein called Vivid. These components are small, fast-acting, and can be fused to a wide range of proteins. The researchers tested eMags in several applications, including recruiting proteins to specific organelles, inducing organelle contacts, and reconstituting a protein complex involved in lipid transport between organelles.

     eMags were found to be more stable and efficient than the original Magnets, with faster association and dissociation kinetics. They were effective in recruiting proteins to different organelles, generating organelle contacts, and reconstituting the protein complex involved in lipid transport. These results demonstrate the potential of eMags as a powerful tool for optogenetic manipulation of cellular processes.

     The eMags system offers several advantages over other optogenetic systems, including rapid association and dissociation kinetics, low background activation, and the ability to control small volumes and subcellular organelles. These properties make eMags a valuable tool for researchers studying cellular biology and developing new therapies.
summary
     Biologists have long known that ribosome stalling during protein synthesis can lead to cell death in neurons. However, the underlying signaling pathways triggered by stalled ribosomes were unknown. To investigate these pathways, researchers analyzed the brains of mice with a genetic mutation that causes ribosomes to stall during protein synthesis. The study found that a protein called GCN2 is activated in response to ribosome stalling, leading to the phosphorylation of a protein called eIF2α. This, in turn, activates a transcription factor called ATF4, which is a key player in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway.

     The ISR pathway is a cellular response to stress that helps to regulate protein synthesis and promote cell survival. In this study, the researchers found that the ISR pathway is activated in the brains of mice with stalled ribosomes, and that this activation helps to attenuate (reduce) neurodegeneration. In other words, the activation of GCN2 and the ISR pathway helps to protect neurons from damage caused by ribosome stalling.

     The study also found that the activation of GCN2 and the ISR pathway is not dependent on the presence of a specific type of tRNA (transfer RNA), which is a molecule involved in protein synthesis. This suggests that the mechanism of GCN2 activation by ribosome stalling is more complex than previously thought.

     Furthermore, the researchers found that the absence of GCN2 in mice with stalled ribosomes leads to increased neurodegeneration, particularly in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory and learning. This suggests that GCN2 plays a critical role in protecting neurons from damage caused by ribosome stalling.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the signaling pathways triggered by ribosome stalling and highlights the importance of GCN2 and the ISR pathway in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress. The findings also raise the possibility that ribosome stalling may contribute to GCN2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation, where levels of acylated tRNA are low. The exact mechanism of GCN2 activation by ribosome stalling remains unclear and requires further investigation.
Summary
     Over the past century, adult human height has changed substantially and unevenly across the world's countries. A recent analysis of 1472 population-based studies involving over 18.6 million participants found that the largest gains in adult height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and South Asia over the past century.

     The tallest people over the past 100 years were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, with an average height of 182.5 cm. Women born in Guatemala in 1896 were the shortest, with an average height of 140.3 cm. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was approximately 19-20 cm a century ago and has remained the same for women and increased for men over the past century.

     The analysis found that changes in adult height varied drastically across countries. While European men's heights increased significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries, the largest gains since the 1896 birth cohort occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men. Women in Norway, Iceland, the USA, and American Samoa were also taller than 158 cm. In contrast, women in El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, South Korea, and Japan had the next shortest heights.

     The tallest populations a century ago lived in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and some Pacific islands. Men born in Sweden, Norway, and the USA had average heights of over 171 cm, while Swedish women had an average height of 160.3 cm. In contrast, men born in 1996 in the Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, and Denmark had average heights of over 181 cm, with Dutch men being the tallest at 182.5 cm. The gap between the tallest and shortest countries has increased over the past century, with men in Timor-Leste, Yemen, and Laos having average heights of around 160 cm.
summary
     Opioid overdose has become a major public health concern in the United States, with rates quadrupling between 1999 and 2017 and resulting in 130 deaths per day. To combat this crisis, researchers have been working to understand the brain mechanisms behind opioid-induced respiratory depression. A recent study has made a significant breakthrough in this area by identifying two key brainstem sites responsible for the effects of opioids on breathing.

     The study found that the preBötzinger Complex, a region in the brainstem where the breathing rhythm originates, is a critical site for opioid-induced respiratory depression. Using genetic tools, the researchers discovered that just 70-140 neurons in this region are responsible for the sensitivity to opioids. These neurons are glutamatergic, meaning they use the neurotransmitter glutamate to communicate with other cells.

     The study also found that deleting the µ-Opioid receptor from these neurons eliminates opioid-induced respiratory depression, even at high doses of the potent opioid fentanyl. This suggests that targeting just these two sites is sufficient to rescue opioid respiratory depression without affecting the analgesic effects of opioids. The researchers propose that opioids may be acting by silencing presynaptic release, effectively removing these neurons from the network, or that a small subset of preBötC excitatory neurons may generate the inspiratory rhythm and that these key Oprm1 neurons are enriched within this subgroup.

     The study's findings have significant implications for the development of novel therapies that can prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia. By targeting these specific neurons, researchers may be able to create safer opioids or rescue strategies for opioid overdose. The study's results also highlight the importance of the preBötzinger Complex in regulating breathing and the need for further research into the neural mechanisms underlying opioid-induced respiratory depression.
Summary
     Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus, hepatitis D virus (HDV), are major public health concerns. These viruses infect the liver and can cause severe disease, especially in individuals coinfected with both viruses. Researchers have long sought to understand how HBV and HDV enter liver cells, but the identity of the receptor(s) responsible for this process has remained unknown.

     A team of scientists used a combination of biochemical and virological approaches to identify the receptor(s) that HBV and HDV use to enter liver cells. They found that the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a functional receptor for both viruses. NTCP is a multiple transmembrane transporter that is predominantly expressed in the liver.

     The researchers used a technique called near-zero distance photo-cross-linking to show that the pre-S1 domain of the large envelope protein of HBV specifically interacts with NTCP. They also used tandem affinity purification to confirm this interaction. Silencing NTCP in liver cells inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while expressing NTCP in cells that were not normally susceptible to these viruses made them susceptible.

     The researchers also found that replacing certain amino acids in monkey NTCP with the corresponding amino acids in human NTCP restored the ability of NTCP to support HBV and HDV infection. This suggests that the specific sequence of amino acids between positions 157 and 165 of NTCP is crucial for binding to the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the L protein of HBV.

     These findings demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV, and that it plays a critical role in the entry of these viruses into liver cells. Understanding the role of NTCP in HBV and HDV infection may lead to the development of new treatments for these diseases.
Summary
     Sepsis, a life-threatening condition caused by an overwhelming immune response to an infection, can have long-lasting effects on the body's immune system. Specifically, it can alter the function and behavior of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. Memory CD8 T cells are essential for providing long-term immunity against pathogens, and their impairment due to sepsis can increase the risk of re-infection.

     Researchers have previously studied the immediate effects of sepsis on memory CD8 T cells, but the extent to which these cells recover and regain their function after sepsis has been unclear. A recent study investigated this question by examining the behavior of memory CD8 T cells in patients who had survived sepsis and in mice that had been induced with sepsis.

     The study found that memory CD8 T cells from septic patients and mice proliferated more than those from healthy individuals. This increased proliferation led to changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool, with central memory CD8 T cells becoming over-represented. Central memory CD8 T cells are a type of memory CD8 T cell that is capable of proliferating and differentiating into effector cells.

     The study also found that memory CD8 T cells from sepsis survivors had an altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility, indicating long-lasting changes in the cells' gene expression and epigenetic landscape. These changes resulted in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control infections.

     The study's findings suggest that sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype, function, and localization of memory CD8 T cells. This can have significant implications for the body's ability to respond to re-infection. The study's results highlight the need for further research into the long-term effects of sepsis on the immune system and the development of strategies to mitigate these effects.
Scientists have long known that a type of genetic material called LINE-1 (L1) can jump from one location to another in the human genome, potentially causing mutations. To prevent this, human cells have developed ways to regulate L1 activity. One way to do this is through the APOBEC3 (A3) gene family, which includes seven enzymes that can modify DNA. APOBEC3A (A3A) is the most potent inhibitor of L1 activity, but its mechanism of action has been unclear.

    Researchers used in vitro and in vivo assays to study how A3A works. They found that A3A can inhibit L1 activity by modifying single-strand DNA that is temporarily exposed during the L1 integration process. This modification, called deamination, changes the DNA sequence, making it harder for L1 to integrate into the genome.

    The researchers also engineered human cells to express A3A and a protein that blocks the repair of damaged DNA. This allowed them to detect A3A-mediated deamination events in L1 retrotransposition. The results showed that A3A can indeed inhibit L1 activity by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA.

    Previous studies had suggested that A3A inhibits L1 activity, but failed to detect deamination events. The researchers propose that this may be because the deaminated DNA is degraded before it can be detected. They used an in vitro assay to study the first step of L1 integration and found that A3A can inhibit L1 activity by deaminating single-strand DNA.

    The study provides a new understanding of how A3A inhibits L1 activity and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms that regulate L1 retrotransposition. The findings have implications for our understanding of how human cells protect themselves from genetic mutations caused by L1 activity.
summary
     Biomedical research has shown that sensory experiences play a crucial role in shaping neural circuitry by modifying synaptic connections and intrinsic properties of individual neurons. To understand how external stimuli are converted into altered neuronal output, scientists have been investigating the molecular players involved in experience-dependent plasticity and circuit function. A recent study has identified the activity-regulated, non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 as a key molecule in visual circuit plasticity.

     The study found that mice lacking the Rem2 gene (Rem2-/-) failed to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, the research established a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating the intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. Additionally, both in vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2.

     The study suggests that Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity to preserve proper circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. The results raise the possibility that Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling.

     To gain more insight into the circuit mechanisms underlying the observed ocular dominance plasticity deficits of Rem2-/- mice, the researchers examined adult ocular dominance plasticity. The findings indicate that Rem2 functions as a regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at the morphological, cellular, and circuit levels, providing an important step forward in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function.

     The study also found that Rem2 expression is acutely regulated by visual experience, suggesting that it may play a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation. Overall, the research demonstrates that Rem2 is a key molecule that regulates neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.
Biomedical researchers have been exploring the possibility of using magnetic fields to control biological systems, a concept known as magnetogenetics. Recent studies have reported promising results, including the identification of a protein complex that acts like a compass needle to guide magnetic orientation in animals, and the use of magnetic fields to control membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein. However, a closer examination of these claims reveals that they conflict with basic laws of physics.

The forces and torques produced by magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells are too small to have the desired effects on molecular orientation or membrane channels. If the reported phenomena do occur, they must rely on a mechanism entirely different from the ones proposed by the authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes, such as ferritin, limits their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells.

One study reported the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane. The system consisted of a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel fused to two subunits of ferritin. The hope was that the paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel and depolarize cells. Experimental results suggested that neural activity could be modulated by static magnetic fields, but the evidence was limited and hard to interpret.

The biophysical mechanism underlying these effects is unclear. Ferritin is a large protein complex with 24 subunits that forms a spherical shell about 12 nm in diameter. The forces or temperatures produced by magnetic fields on such a complex are too small to have the desired effects. Barring dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter, the proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields, have no chance of success.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how stem cells switch between different states, including self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence. Quiescence, a state of dormancy, is particularly important for stem cell-based therapies, as it allows stem cells to conserve energy and resources. Researchers have used Drosophila neural progenitors, also known as neuroblasts, as a model system to study self-renewal and differentiation. However, the mechanisms underlying quiescence in these cells have remained poorly understood.

     A recent study has shed new light on this process. The researchers found that a protein called Prospero, which is involved in differentiation, is transiently detected in the nucleus of neuroblasts just before they enter quiescence. This transient presence of Prospero is followed by a unique molecular profile that lacks markers of progenitor and differentiation cells. The study also showed that the loss of Prospero prevents neuroblasts from entering quiescence, while a pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero can drive proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence.

     The researchers propose that Prospero levels can distinguish between three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation. They found that nearly all neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hours after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers 24 hours later. Additionally, they showed that precocious low-level nuclear Prospero can advance the timing of neuroblast quiescence.

     The study suggests that a pulse of low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence. The researchers also found that the timing of nuclear Prospero precisely matches the timing of neuroblast quiescence, and that loss of Prospero can delay the timing of neuroblast quiescence. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying quiescence in Drosophila neural progenitors and highlights the importance of Prospero in regulating this process. The findings have implications for our understanding of stem cell biology and may inform the development of stem cell-based therapies.
Summary
     Scientists have long been interested in understanding how the HIV-1 virus disassembles its outer shell, called the capsid, to release its genetic material. This process, called uncoating, is a crucial step in the virus's life cycle. A team of researchers has developed a new method to study the uncoating process in real-time using single-particle fluorescence microscopy. This technique allows them to observe the behavior of individual HIV-1 capsids as they disassemble.

     The researchers found that the first step in uncoating is the opening of a defect in the capsid lattice, which is the rate-limiting step. This is followed by a rapid and catastrophic collapse of the capsid. They also discovered that different molecules can affect the uncoating process at different stages. For example, a molecule called PF74 accelerates the opening of the capsid but stabilizes the remaining lattice, while a polyanion delays the initiation of uncoating but does not prevent it.

     The researchers used their new method to study the behavior of hundreds of individual HIV-1 capsids in a single experiment. They found that the integrity and stability of the capsids in a population is highly heterogeneous, with most capsids containing defects or uncoating immediately after the viral membrane is removed. In the absence of capsid binders, uncoating is an all-or-none process that proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created.

     The study provides new insights into the uncoating process of HIV-1 and how it can be modulated by different molecules. The findings suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently, and the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators determines the overall uncoating kinetics. This knowledge could potentially be used to develop new strategies to prevent or treat HIV-1 infection.
summary
     Biomedical research has revealed that the cJUN NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability and preventing tumor initiation in breast cancer. Contrary to the expectation that JNK signaling promotes cell proliferation by activating the AP1 transcription factor, studies have found that loss-of-function mutations in the JNK pathway are frequent in breast cancer genomic DNA. In fact, analysis of murine breast epithelium has shown that JNK deficiency causes genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Furthermore, JNK deficiency accelerates tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer, characterized by widespread early neoplasia and genomic instability.

     The significance of JNK pathway inactivation in breast cancer has been unclear, but recent studies have demonstrated that loss of JNK signaling promotes murine breast cancer development. In fact, the frequent JNK pathway loss-of-function mutations in human breast cancer may represent "driver" mutations that promote tumor development. The study found that JNK loss plays a key role at the early stages of breast cancer development by promoting mammary gland neoplasia. This observation likely accounts for the effect of mutational inactivation of JNK signaling to promote tumor development.

     The JNK signaling pathway may be suppressed in many breast cancers, and the association of breast cancer with reduced JNK signaling represents a correlation. The study aimed to test the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development and found that JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer. Moreover, JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer. The major conclusions of this study are that JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer and that JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer. These findings suggest that the JNK pathway plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability and preventing tumor initiation in breast cancer.
Summary
     A recent study has identified a crucial enzyme called peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM) that plays a key role in the formation of cilia in different cell types. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that are essential for sensing the environment and transmitting signals. The researchers found that PAM is required for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in the green algae Chlamydomonas, the flatworm planaria, and mice.

     In Chlamydomonas, PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia assembly components. Similarly, in planaria, decreased PAM gene expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. In mice, the architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in PAM-deficient embryos was also aberrant.

     The study suggests that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to the observed ciliogenesis defects. The researchers propose that PAM has a novel and highly conserved signaling or sensory function in eukaryotic cilia. They also found that PAM is required for the biogenesis of the motile cilia present in Chlamydomonas and on the ventral epithelium of planaria, as well as the normal assembly of the primary cilia of neuroepithelial cells in mammals.

     The study highlights the importance of PAM in ciliogenesis and provides an unanticipated link between PAM, amidation, and ciliary assembly. The findings suggest that PAM plays a key role in the early steps of ciliogenesis, revealing a novel link between amidation and cilium assembly in multiple cell types. The researchers propose that PAM may have been included in the set of signaling proteins trafficked to the ciliary compartment from the Golgi in the ancestral eukaryote. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ciliogenesis and the role of PAM in this process.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that two proteins, Myosin III and Espin, play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. Stereocilia are long, thin structures on the surface of hair cells that are essential for hearing and balance. Defects in Myosin III and Espin have been linked to hereditary hearing impairments. To understand how these proteins work together, researchers studied the interaction between Myosin III and Espin. They found that Myosin III has a special region called the tail homology I motif (THDI) that can bind to Espin. This binding is crucial for the assembly and stabilization of actin bundles in stereocilia.

     The researchers discovered that the THDI region of Myosin III contains two repeat sequences that can independently bind to Espin with high affinity. This binding causes Espin to release its auto-inhibition, allowing it to promote the formation of thicker actin bundles. Actin bundles are essential for the structure and function of stereocilia. The researchers also found that the binding of Myosin III to Espin can stimulate the bundling activity of Espin, leading to the formation of thicker and more stable actin bundles.

     The study provides new insights into the molecular basis of the Myosin III and Espin interaction. It reveals a previously unrecognized mechanism by which Myosin III can regulate the actin bundling activity of Espin. The findings have important implications for our understanding of the development and maintenance of stereocilia and the causes of hereditary hearing impairments. The study also suggests that the Myosin III and Espin interaction may be a key factor in the formation of thicker and more stable actin bundles in cellular structures such as stereocilia.

     The researchers propose that the Myosin III and Espin interaction plays a critical role in promoting the formation of thicker parallel actin bundle fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia. This is supported by previous studies that have shown that Myosin III and Espin co-localize at the tips of stereocilia and that co-expression of Myosin III and Espin can stimulate the elongation of stereocilia in cultured hair cells. The study provides new evidence for the importance of the Myosin III and Espin interaction in the development and maintenance of stereocilia and highlights the potential of this interaction as a therapeutic target for the treatment of hereditary hearing impairments.
Summary
     Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. These channels translate electrical signals into calcium influx, allowing cells to respond to changes in their environment. To understand how these channels work, researchers studied the structure and function of two distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) in the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1.1.

     The researchers used a combination of computational modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of the two VSDs. They found that both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model, but differed significantly in the formation of ion pairs between the outer gating charges.

     The study revealed that stabilizing the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilizing the resting state slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a new understanding of how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can give rise to the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.

     The researchers used advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1.1 VSDs to fill a gap in the understanding of the voltage-sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. The models accurately predicted the effects of interaction partners on channel gating when experimentally tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis.

     The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms governing the specific gating properties of voltage-gated calcium channels. The findings have implications for our understanding of cellular excitability and the regulation of various cellular functions, including muscle contraction, neurotransmitter release, and gene expression. The research also highlights the importance of ion-pair formation in separate VSDs in determining the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels.
summary
     Biomedical research has long been interested in the adult brain's ability to undergo plastic changes, particularly in the context of recovery from injuries or improving learning and cognition. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been linked to juvenile experience-dependent plasticity in the primary visual cortex (V1), but their role in adult V1 plasticity remains poorly understood. A recent study investigated the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice.

     The study found that MMP-inhibition prevented visual plasticity in healthy animals when applied for 7 days. However, in stroke-affected mice, a single treatment with an MMP-inhibitor after the stroke rescued plasticity, which is normally lost under these conditions. These findings suggest that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur.

     MMPs play a critical role in facilitating structural changes in the healthy brain, but their upregulation after a brain injury can promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. The study's results imply that precise regulation of MMP-activity is essential for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain. The findings offer new opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke.

     The study used a combination of in vivo optical imaging and behavioral vision tests to examine the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected mice. The results demonstrate a vital role of MMPs for adult visual cortex plasticity, particularly for the increase of open eye responses in V1 after monocular deprivation (MD).

     Previous studies have shown that MMP-activity supports healthy brain development and function, but a different outcome of MMP-action has been described for diseased brain. Increased MMP-activity was observed within 24 hours of a photothrombotically induced stroke, and application of a broad-spectrum MMP-inhibitor at the time of the stroke partially rescued impaired barrel cortex plasticity.

     The study's findings have significant implications for understanding the role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur. The results also highlight the importance of precise regulation of MMP-activity for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain and offer new opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how AMPA receptors, a type of ion channel found in the brain, work to transmit signals between neurons. These receptors are made up of four subunits that come together to form a dimer-of-dimers structure. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have allowed researchers to visualize the full structure of AMPA receptors, both on their own and in combination with auxiliary subunits.

     When AMPA receptors are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, they open up to allow ions to flow in and out of the cell. However, it was unclear whether the extracellular layer of the receptor undergoes significant structural changes during this process. To investigate this, researchers used a technique called bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linking to study the conformation of AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin.

     The results showed that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can become trapped in a stable, opened-up conformation, especially when exposed to glutamate for a long time. However, the presence of Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. This suggests that under normal synaptic conditions, where glutamate exposure is brief and auxiliary proteins are present, the extracellular domains of AMPA receptors remain compact during activation and desensitization.

     The researchers conclude that the extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission. Instead, they work in a relatively compact conformational regime, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions. This study provides new insights into the structure and function of AMPA receptors and has implications for our understanding of synaptic transmission and neurological disorders. The findings also highlight the importance of auxiliary subunits in regulating the conformational flexibility of AMPA receptors.
Scientists have long struggled to study the immune cells in the intestines of mice infected with parasitic worms, known as helminths. This is because the immune response to these parasites triggers a strong reaction that makes it difficult to isolate and analyze the cells. A team of researchers developed a new method to isolate millions of immune cells from the intestines of infected mice, allowing them to study the immune response in detail.

To validate their method, the researchers used a high-tech tool called spectral flow cytometry to analyze the cells. This tool can detect many different markers on the surface of the cells, giving a detailed picture of the immune response. They also used a microscope to confirm their findings.

The researchers were able to identify many known features of the immune response to helminths, such as the presence of certain types of immune cells and the production of mucus. They found that these changes occurred throughout the entire course of the infection, not just in specific areas of the intestine. This suggests that the immune response to helminths is a complex process that involves many different cell types and mechanisms.

The new method developed by the researchers has the potential to accelerate the discovery of new insights into the immune response to helminths. By allowing scientists to study the immune cells in the intestines of infected mice in greater detail, it may be possible to develop new treatments for helminth infections, which affect millions of people worldwide. The method also highlights the importance of using good cell isolation techniques to study the immune response in the intestines, as many changes occur locally and may not be detected by other methods.

The researchers used a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel to analyze the cells, which allowed them to detect many of the hallmark surface and intracellular markers associated with helminth infections. They also used confocal microscopy to validate their findings, and found that the changes in cell ratios were faithfully reported by both methods. This suggests that the new method is a reliable way to study the immune response to helminths.

Overall, the new method developed by the researchers provides a powerful tool for studying the immune response to helminths, and has the potential to accelerate our understanding of this complex process.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the proteasome, a complex enzyme, plays a crucial role in breaking down proteins in the cell. This process, called protein degradation, is essential for various cellular functions, including metabolism and the immune response. However, the mechanisms that regulate proteasome activity are not yet fully understood.

     Researchers used a combination of experiments and computer modeling to develop a new understanding of how the proteasome works. They focused on the 20S proteasome, a dynamic enzyme that changes its activity over time due to interactions with substrates and products. The team created a mathematical model that predicts the locations of regulatory sites on the proteasome and how they interact with each other and with substrates.

     The study found that the rate-limiting step in protein degradation is the transport of substrates into the proteasome. The efficiency of this transport varies between different types of proteasomes, known as standard and immuno-proteasomes. This variation affects the overall rate of protein degradation and the way substrates are broken down.

     The researchers used short, specially designed peptides to study proteasome dynamics in real-time. They observed similar patterns of proteasome activity when using purified 20S proteasomes and protein homogenates, which contain regulatory molecules that surround the proteasomes. This suggests that the model developed in the study can describe the core features of proteasome dynamics in more complex cellular environments.

     The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of proteasomal action and the differences in substrate-specific proteolysis between different proteasome isoforms. The findings have implications for our understanding of protein degradation and its role in various cellular processes, including metabolism and the immune response. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interactions between proteasomes and their substrates.
summary
     Biologists have long known that the recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission, the process by which neurons communicate with each other. In fruit flies (Drosophila), histamine is a key neurotransmitter involved in visual synaptic transmission. To recycle histamine, it must first be converted into a compound called carcinine, which is then broken down into histamine and beta-alanine. However, it was unclear how beta-alanine was returned to the cells that produce histamine.

     Researchers have now identified a new protein, called BalaT, that acts as a beta-alanine transporter in Drosophila. This protein is found in retinal pigment cells, which play a critical role in visual neurotransmission. Without BalaT, beta-alanine levels in the retina are lower, and visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior (the ability to navigate towards light) are impaired.

     The discovery of BalaT provides the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells are essential for visual neurotransmission. It also suggests that a BalaT-dependent beta-alanine trafficking pathway is necessary for maintaining histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission. This pathway involves the transport of beta-alanine from photoreceptors to retinal pigment cells, where it is stored and recycled.

     The researchers propose that BalaT functions in retinal pigment cells to help recycle beta-alanine, which is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. They also suggest that establishing and maintaining a beta-alanine pool is critical for sustaining visual synaptic transmission. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying visual neurotransmission and highlights the importance of beta-alanine recycling in this process.

     The findings have implications for our understanding of the conserved function of beta-alanine trafficking in mammals and Drosophila. The study provides evidence for a more complete histamine recycling pathway, which is critical for sustaining photoreceptor synaptic transmission. This pathway involves the synthesis of carcinine in epithelial glial cells, its transport back to photoreceptor cells via the synaptic cleft, and the breakdown of carcinine into histamine and beta-alanine. The discovery of BalaT and its role in beta-alanine recycling sheds light on the complex mechanisms underlying visual neurotransmission and highlights the importance of beta-alanine recycling in this process.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand the role of oxidants in aging and lifespan. A recent study used yeast cells to investigate this question. The researchers found that as yeast cells age, they undergo a sudden loss of redox balance, leading to the oxidation of nearly 80% of their proteins. This event occurs several days before the cells die. The study suggests that this loss of redox balance is not caused by an increase in oxidants, as previously thought, but rather by a decrease in NADPH, a molecule that helps maintain cellular redox homeostasis. NADPH levels drop early in the aging process, triggering a cascade of events that ultimately leads to the oxidation of proteins.

     The researchers also found that caloric restriction, a well-known method for extending lifespan, increases NADPH levels and delays the onset of the redox collapse. This suggests that maintaining NADPH levels may be a key factor in preventing or slowing aging. The study provides a timeline of events leading up to the oxidation of the proteome, which occurs days before cell death. The findings have implications for our understanding of aging and may shed light on the mechanisms underlying age-related diseases.

     The study used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast, as a model system to investigate aging. The researchers monitored the thiol oxidation status of nearly 300 different proteins and found that yeast cells undergo a global redox collapse several days before cell death. This collapse is characterized by the oxidation of nearly 80% of identified proteins. The study suggests that the observed decrease in NADPH levels and the concomitant increase in cellular redox potential may not be unique to yeast, but may be shared with other aging organisms.

     The researchers propose that the redox collapse may be a physiological stress condition that utilizes and stresses the redox buffering capacity of the thiol proteome. They also suggest that the oxidation of some key proteins may contribute to the beneficial down-regulation of cellular processes that would otherwise negatively affect yeast lifespan. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of aging and may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay age-related diseases.
summary
     Biologists have long known that the molecules that make up living things, such as proteins and DNA, have a specific "handedness" or chirality. This homochirality is crucial for the proper functioning of cells. To maintain this homochirality, cells have mechanisms in place to prevent the incorporation of the wrong type of amino acid, called D-amino acids, into proteins. A key player in this process is an enzyme called D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD), which removes D-amino acids that have mistakenly attached to transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules.

     A recent study has shed light on how DTD works. The researchers used a technique called X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of DTD from the parasite Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a molecule that mimics the D-aminoacyl-tRNA. This structure revealed how DTD captures the chiral center of the D-aminoacyl-tRNA, which is the part of the molecule that determines its handedness.

     The study found that DTD uses a unique mechanism to recognize and remove D-amino acids. Unlike other enzymes that rely on specific interactions with the side chains of amino acids, DTD uses a "cross-subunit" Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral center of the D-aminoacyl-tRNA. This means that DTD can recognize and remove D-amino acids without directly interacting with their side chains, allowing it to act on multiple types of D-amino acids.

     The researchers also found that the strict chiral specificity of DTD explains why the cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs is enriched. L-amino acids are the correct type of amino acid for protein synthesis, and DTD's ability to remove D-amino acids ensures that they do not get incorporated into proteins.

     The study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselective mechanism that is essential for maintaining homochirality in proteins. It also highlights the importance of weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells maintain their homochirality and prevent the incorporation of D-amino acids into proteins.
Summary
     The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride ion channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP, which induces the dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). This dimerization opens the pore, while disruption of ATP hydrolysis closes it. In wild-type CFTR, spontaneous openings without ATP are rare, but in certain CF mutants, they constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator.

     Researchers have correlated energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. They found that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may occur even without ATP. This suggests that coordinated NBD/pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, and that ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations.

     The study shows that the presence of bound ATP does not alter the global arrangement of conformations, but rather acts as a'molecular glue' to stabilize the transition state and the open state. The researchers also found that the ligand binding site is occluded in open channels, so that an open-state 'binding affinity' cannot be defined. This means that even when disruption of ATP hydrolysis forces CFTR channels to gate at equilibrium, that gating follows a reversible linear sequence, rather than a cycle subject to the principle of detailed balance.

     The study provides insights into the mechanism by which binding of the natural ligand ATP promotes CFTR channel opening. It also explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, and provides a better understanding of CF mutation and drug mechanisms. The findings have implications for understanding the underlying driving forces of ATP-dependent channel gating, which are likely conserved among ABC proteins.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new force that drives the assembly of transmembrane proteins in cell membranes. This force, called the "orderphobic effect," arises from the interaction between the protein and the membrane's phase transition from an ordered to a disordered state. The study used large-scale molecular simulations to model the behavior of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers.

     The researchers found that a protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer can stabilize a microscopic order-disorder interface. This interface has a finite stiffness, and when two such proteins approach each other, they assemble because assembly reduces the net interfacial energy. The orderphobic effect is mediated by the proximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein.

     The study showed that the strength and range of forces arising from the orderphobic effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered. The orderphobic effect leverages the power of a phase transition, similar to the hydrophobic effect, and depends on the ability of the orderphobic protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. This ability depends on the proximity to the membrane's phase transition and the protein's radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane.

     The researchers found that a transmembrane protein with a hydrophobic thickness of approximately 2.6 nm will favor the structure of the disordered phase. If the protein is large enough, it can melt the ordered phase near the protein and result in the formation of an order-disorder interface. This phenomenon may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques.

     The study also found that there is a dual to the orderphobic effect, where a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order-disorder interface. Interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions will again provide a force for assembly. The regular tail packing in the ordered phase results in a larger hydrophobic thickness than in the disordered phase, leading to a smaller area per lipid in the ordered phase.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long used fluorescent calcium indicators to study neural dynamics, but the relationship between these indicators and action potentials (APs) has remained unclear. To address this, a recent study characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. The researchers used simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings to investigate the relationship between APs and fluorescence signals.

     The study found that under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of APs were detected. Specifically, only 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected in about 10% and 20-30% of cases, respectively. This highlights the limitations of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions.

     To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves, the researchers identified isolated AP events and summed them over 250 ms. They found that only a minority of APs were used to construct these curves. The study also tested the performance of several spike inference models, detecting APs under optimal and less optimal conditions. The results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals, which will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets.

     Genetically encoded calcium indicators, such as GCaMP6s and GCaMP6f, are widely used to report neuronal activity within local populations in vivo. These indicators enable simultaneous measurement of activity from hundreds or thousands of neurons at single-cell resolution, over multiple sessions. However, the relationship between APs and fluorescence signals has remained unclear, making it challenging to infer underlying AP trains or firing rates from calcium imaging data. The study's findings will facilitate the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging studies using mainstream transgenic mouse lines, such as the Allen Institute's Brain Observatory Visual Coding dataset.
Female Neotrogla, a species of cave insect, has evolved a unique biological switching valve in its genitalia. This valve allows the female to control the direction of seminal flow and receive multiple seminal packages from the same or different males within a short time span. The switching valve is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. It enables the female to selectively use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other slot empty, and receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males.

The female Neotrogla has a penis-like intromittent organ, which is used to coercively anchor males during copulation. This allows the female to control the mating process and obtain more semen from the male. The semen is packed in a capsule, which is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. This unique reproductive strategy is thought to be an adaptation to the nutrient-poor cave habitats inhabited by Neotrogla.

The evolution of the switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. The male-holding organ and long copulation durations of 40-70 hours in Neotrogla are considered exaggerated adaptations for competition for nuptial gifts in this group of insects. The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus.

Female-female competition for males to receive nutritious seminal substances is considered the most important factor driving the evolution of the female penis in Neotrogla. In contrast, a closely related species lacking reversal of genital structure, Lepinotus patruelis, has a much shorter copulation duration of 50 minutes. The female penis of Neotrogla bears spines, which are used to anchor males during copulation, allowing the female to control the mating process and obtain more semen. This unique reproductive strategy is thought to be an adaptation to the nutrient-poor cave habitats inhabited by Neotrogla.
Biologists have long sought to understand the complex process of synaptic exocytosis, where neurons release neurotransmitters to communicate with each other. A crucial step in this process is the assembly of SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins, which couple their stage-wise folding and assembly to rapid exocytosis. However, the functions of the different assembly stages and the role of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly were not well understood.

    Researchers used optical tweezers to observe four distinct stages of SNARE assembly: N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). They found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly and exocytosis. The NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while the MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures the t-SNARE C-terminus independent of the syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD.

    The study also showed that Munc18-1 regulates every stage of SNARE assembly. In the absence of Munc18-1, SNARE reassembly was not observed due to dissociation of the SNAP-25 molecule. However, in the presence of Munc18-1, 45% of completely unfolded SNARE complexes showed full reassembly. This suggests that Munc18-1 holds the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as the t-SNARE unfolds, facilitating de novo SNARE assembly.

    The researchers observed three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with previously reported multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex. The most distinct Munc18-1 activity is to enhance de novo SNARE assembly. A working model was proposed to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion. The study concludes that Munc18-1 mainly acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly.
Summary
     Biologists have long wondered how cells create complex structures called focal adhesions, which help cells attach to their surroundings. Focal adhesions are made up of many different proteins working together, but it's unclear how these proteins come together to form these structures. Researchers used a technique called fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy to study the proteins involved in focal adhesions, called the integrin adhesome. They found that these proteins are already assembled into small groups, or building blocks, in the cell's cytosol, the jelly-like substance inside the cell.

     These building blocks are made up of the same types of proteins that are found in focal adhesions, and they are evenly distributed throughout the cytosol. When focal adhesions form, they release these building blocks back into the cytosol, where they can be reused to form new adhesions. This process is called symmetric exchange. The researchers found that the building blocks are not altered as they move between the focal adhesions and the cytosol, which is important for maintaining the correct structure and function of the adhesions.

     The study suggests that the integrin adhesome is pre-assembled in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks that can rapidly and modularly assemble into focal adhesions. The researchers propose a model in which these building blocks are switched on at the plasma membrane, allowing them to self-assemble into adhesion sites. This process is controlled by checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome.

     The study provides new insights into how cells create complex structures like focal adhesions. The findings suggest that the integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks that can facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. The symmetric exchange of these building blocks between adhesion sites and the cytosol preserves their specifications and maintains the assembly logic of the system. This research has important implications for understanding how cells interact with their surroundings and how this process goes awry in diseases such as cancer.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified a common electrophysiological marker that can track states of reduced arousal in humans, including different sleep stages and anesthesia. This marker, known as the 1/f spectral slope, is a measure of the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity in the brain. The study used intracranial and surface EEG recordings from four independent data sets to demonstrate that the 1/f spectral slope can distinguish between wakefulness and reduced arousal states, including non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol.

     The researchers found that the 1/f spectral slope becomes more negative, or steeper, in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. This suggests that the slope is a reliable indicator of reduced arousal levels. The study also showed that the spectral slope can discriminate between wakefulness and NREM sleep, as well as between wakefulness and REM sleep. This is significant because REM sleep is characterized by a desynchronized, "wake-like" electroencephalogram (EEG) pattern, which is different from the synchronized oscillations seen in NREM sleep.

     The researchers used two datasets obtained during a full night of sleep to examine if the spectral slope could discern wakefulness from different sleep stages. They found that the spectral slope mirrored the rapid changes in excitability observed over the course of a slow wave, providing a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations.

     The study also demonstrated that the non-oscillatory, aperiodic part of the power spectrum, which is devoid of prominent low-frequency oscillatory components, can be approximated by the 1/f decay of the power spectrum estimated from the 30 to 45 Hz frequency range. This range reliably differentiates wakefulness from all three states of reduced arousal level, namely REM, N3 sleep, and general anesthesia with propofol.

     The findings of this study provide empirical evidence for the notion that the slope in the range from 30 to 45 Hz correlates well with all stages of arousal. The researchers conclude that the 1/f spectral slope is a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including different sleep stages and anesthesia in humans.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that chloroplasts, the organelles responsible for photosynthesis in plant cells, are dynamic and can move within the cell. However, the mechanisms behind this movement were not well understood. A recent study has shed light on how chloroplasts move in plant cells, particularly in response to an innate immune response.

     The study found that chloroplasts are connected to the cell's nucleus by dynamic tubular extensions called stromules. These stromules extend along microtubules, which are part of the cell's cytoskeleton, and anchor to actin filaments, another component of the cytoskeleton. The study showed that the organization of microtubules directly affects the dynamics of stromules, with stabilization of microtubules increasing the number and length of stromules.

     Interestingly, the direction of stromules from chloroplasts correlates with the direction of chloroplast movement. In fact, the study found that stromules can guide chloroplasts to the nucleus, even in the absence of an immune response. This suggests that stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts is a general function of stromules in epidermal cells.

     The study proposes a model in which stromules extend along microtubules and connect to actin anchor points surrounding the nucleus, facilitating stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts to the nucleus during an innate immune response. This movement is thought to be important for perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during an immune response.

     The study also found that microtubules are required for stromule extension and movement, while actin filaments provide anchor points for stromules. Depolymerization of microtubules led to stromule retraction, while stabilization of microtubules increased stromule frequency.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms behind chloroplast movement in plant cells, particularly in response to an innate immune response. The findings suggest that stromules play a key role in guiding chloroplasts to the nucleus, and that microtubules and actin filaments work together to facilitate this movement. Further research is needed to understand the molecular components required for stromule dynamics and the importance of perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate immunity.
Summary
     Scientists have developed a new method to predict how proteins interact with each other at the molecular level. Proteins are complex molecules that perform a wide range of functions in the body, and understanding how they interact with each other is crucial for understanding many biological processes. The new method uses evolutionary information to identify which amino acids on one protein are likely to interact with amino acids on another protein.

     The researchers tested their method on 50S ribosomal units and 28 other protein complexes with known structures. They found that the method was highly accurate in predicting which amino acids were in contact with each other. The method works by analyzing the amino acid sequences of many different versions of a protein and looking for patterns of co-evolution, where changes in one amino acid are associated with changes in another amino acid.

     The researchers then applied their method to 36 protein complexes with unknown structures and were able to make predictions about which amino acids were in contact with each other. They used these predictions to build models of the structures of four of these complexes, including the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter.

     The researchers found that their method was highly accurate in predicting which amino acids were in contact with each other, even when the number of aligned sequences was limited. They also found that significant residue-residue covariance occurred frequently between physically interacting protein pairs, but rarely between non-interacting pairs. This suggests that the method could be useful for predicting whether two proteins interact with each other.

     The new method has the potential to contribute to the determination of the structures of many biologically important complexes, which could lead to a better understanding of many biological processes and the development of new treatments for diseases. The method could also be used to study the evolution of protein-protein interactions and how they change over time.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers used a novel approach to study how people categorize visual patterns. They asked participants to look at a series of images and identify the category they belonged to. The researchers tracked the participants' eye movements and found that they used an "active sensing" strategy to gather information from multiple locations in the scene. This means that participants adjusted their eye movements based on what they already knew about the scene and the statistical structure of the patterns.

     The researchers compared the participants' eye movements to an "optimal" strategy that would gather the most information from the scene. They found that the participants' eye movements were not perfect, but were about 70% as efficient as the optimal strategy. This means that the participants were able to gather a lot of information from the scene, but not all of it.

     The researchers also found that the participants' eye movements were influenced by prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in their eye movements. They used a mathematical model to estimate the efficiency of the participants' eye movements and found that the central process of selecting fixation locations was around 70% efficient.

     The study suggests that people use their eye movements to gather information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations in the scene. The researchers used a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and an active sensor algorithm to estimate the information gathered at each fixation location. They found that the participants' eye movements were substantially more efficient than heuristic strategies that only used a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy.

     The study provides new insights into how people categorize visual patterns and how they use their eye movements to gather information from the scene. It also highlights the importance of considering prior biases, perceptual noise, and inaccuracies in eye movements when studying active sensing. The study's findings have implications for understanding how people process visual information and how they make decisions based on that information.
Summary
     The nuclear pore complex (NPC) plays a crucial role in regulating the transport of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. Despite its importance, the mechanisms governing the transport of large cargoes, such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes, through the NPC are not well understood. Researchers have investigated the nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models, ranging in size from 17 to 36 nanometers, with varying numbers of nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). The study found that the requirements for nuclear transport scale non-linearly with size and can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC.

     The researchers used a novel approach to assay nuclear import kinetics in an unprecedented range of cargo sizes and NLS numbers. They found that the transport of small cargoes is influenced by biochemical or physicochemical properties of the cargo surface, whereas large cargoes rely on multivalent binding to transport receptors via NLSs. The study also showed that the import kinetics of large cargoes can be described by a simple two-parameter biophysical model, which correlates the import flux with the energetic requirements for nuclear transport.

     The findings of this study provide key molecular determinants of large cargo import in cells and have implications for understanding the export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes. The study's theoretical model assumes that the capsids do not interact with each other during transport through the pore. However, cargoes that present an NLS and bind nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) can rapidly enter the nucleus, following a mono-exponential behavior.

     The researchers used a reconstituted system to study nuclear transport, adding key components of the transport machinery, including Importinβ, Importinα, RanGDP, NTF2, and GTP, to the cells. The intactness of the nuclear envelope and functional nuclear transport were validated by control experiments using fluorescently labeled dextran and model cargoes. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear transport and has the potential to inform the development of therapeutic strategies for diseases related to nuclear transport dysfunction.
summary
     Biologists have long known that the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 plays a crucial role in the activation of helper T cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight off infections. However, its function in maintaining T cell responses after activation was not well understood. To investigate this, researchers created a strain of mice where CD28 was removed from helper T cells after they were first activated. The study found that continued expression of CD28 is necessary for helper T cells to function properly after infection. Specifically, CD28 is required for the expansion of a type of helper T cell called Th1 cells, which helps fight off intracellular pathogens, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells, which help activate B cells to produce antibodies. The researchers also found that CD28 is necessary for the clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract after infection. These findings demonstrate that CD28 has a previously unknown function in maintaining helper T cell responses after activation, in addition to its well-known role in T cell priming. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between helper T cells and other immune cells, and highlights the importance of CD28 in the immune response to infection. The results of this study have implications for the development of new treatments for infections and autoimmune diseases, where helper T cells play a key role.
Summary
     Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that infects the stomach, has a unique helical shape that allows it to efficiently colonize the stomach lining. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this shape are not well understood. A recent study investigated how H. pylori maintains its helical shape and found that two specific proteins, MreB and CcmA, play a crucial role in this process.

     The researchers used advanced microscopy techniques to analyze the growth patterns of H. pylori cells and found that cell wall synthesis is enhanced at both the inner and outer curves of the helix. They also discovered that MreB, a cytoskeletal protein, is most abundant at the inner curve of the helix, while CcmA, another cytoskeletal protein, is most abundant at the outer curve.

     The study suggests that MreB promotes cell wall synthesis at the inner curve of the helix, while CcmA promotes synthesis at the outer curve. This patterning of cell wall synthesis is essential for maintaining the helical shape of H. pylori. The researchers propose that H. pylori uses a combination of MreB and CcmA to control cell wall synthesis and maintain its unique shape.

     The study also found that H. pylori has a broader distribution of sidewall curvature than other curved-rod bacteria, such as Campylobacter crescentus and Vibrio cholerae. The researchers used computational tools to demonstrate that H. pylori uses distinct mechanisms to achieve its unique curvatures.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the helical shape of H. pylori and highlight the importance of MreB and CcmA in maintaining this shape. The study's results have implications for our understanding of bacterial cell shape and the development of new treatments for H. pylori infections.
summary
     Biologists have discovered a new mechanism that regulates the fusion of mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells. Mitochondrial fusion is a critical process that helps maintain the health and function of these organelles. The researchers found that a protein called Cdc48 plays a key role in this process by controlling the activity of two other proteins, Ubp12 and Ubp2. These two proteins, known as deubiquitylases, remove ubiquitin molecules from a protein called Fzo1, which is essential for mitochondrial fusion.

     The study showed that Cdc48 helps to regulate the balance between the two deubiquitylases, Ubp12 and Ubp2. Ubp12 removes ubiquitin molecules that promote mitochondrial fusion, while Ubp2 removes ubiquitin molecules that inhibit fusion. The researchers found that Cdc48 promotes the degradation of Ubp12, which in turn stabilizes the pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1. On the other hand, the loss of Ubp12 stabilizes Ubp2, which facilitates the removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1, inhibiting fusion.

     The study revealed a new cascade of ubiquitylation events involving Cdc48, Ubp12, and Ubp2, which fine-tunes the fusogenic activity of Fzo1. This cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation, allowing for mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover. The researchers propose that Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a small number of ubiquitin moieties, which are too short to target proteasomal turnover. In contrast, Ubp2 recognizes and cleaves longer ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that target Fzo1 for proteasomal degradation and inhibit mitochondrial fusion.

     The study provides new insights into the complex regulation of mitochondrial fusion and the role of ubiquitin in this process. The findings have implications for our understanding of mitochondrial function and disease, as dysregulation of mitochondrial fusion has been linked to various diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. The study highlights the importance of Cdc48 in regulating the balance between pro-fusion and anti-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1, which is essential for maintaining mitochondrial health and function.
Summary
     The study investigated whether vision is necessary for the development of the categorical organization of the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOTC). Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine VOTC responses to sound categories in sighted and early blind individuals, and visual categories in a separate sighted group. The results showed that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind people, using a representational structure and connectivity similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group, using a representational format closer to the one found in vision.

     The study also found that VOTC in blind individuals represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. This suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of congenitally blind and sighted people that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response. The results demonstrate that a categorical organization similar to the one found in vision can emerge in VOTC in the absence of visual experience, and that such categorical response to sounds is actually enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind people.

     The study used representational similarity analysis to show that categorical membership is the main factor that predicts the representational structure of sounds in VOTC in blind people. This is in contrast to lower-level acoustic attributes of sounds, which are at least partially at the basis of category selectivity in the temporal cortex. The study also found that the categorical representation of auditory stimuli in VOTC of both blind and sighted individuals exhibits different qualitative nuances compared to the categorical organization generated by visual stimuli in sighted people.

     The researchers suggest that the overlap in categorical responses between groups may come from the fact that VOTC represents visual attributes in the sighted and acoustic attributes in the blind due to crossmodal plasticity. Several studies have shown that the occipital cortex in congenitally blind individuals may represent acoustic features, such as frequencies. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the neural basis of categorical perception and the role of experience in shaping the organization of the brain.
Scientists have discovered a way to study how a fungus manipulates the behavior of fruit flies in a laboratory setting. The fungus, called Entomophthora muscae, infects fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and causes them to exhibit unusual behaviors, such as climbing upward, extending their proboscides, and raising their wings, before eventually dying. This behavior is similar to what has been observed in wild fruit flies infected with the same fungus.

     To understand how the fungus achieves this manipulation, researchers isolated a strain of E. muscae and infected D. melanogaster in the lab. They found that the fungus invades the fly's nervous system, suggesting a direct link between the fungus and the fly's behavior. The researchers believe that this new system will allow them to rapidly advance their understanding of how E. muscae manipulates host behavior.

     One possible explanation for the fungus's manipulation of the fly's behavior is that it invades the nervous system, giving it direct access to the fly's neurons. However, the researchers caution that there may be other ways the fungus could be altering the fly's behavior. They propose four possible mechanisms by which E. muscae could be achieving this manipulation.

     To test the fungus's ability to infect hosts outside of fruit flies, the researchers exposed house flies to E. muscae-infected D. melanogaster. They found that the house flies died and sporulated, indicating that they had been killed by the fungus. This suggests that E. muscae may be capable of infecting a wider range of hosts.

     To gain a deeper understanding of how E. muscae infection progresses at the molecular level, the researchers measured changes in gene expression in both the host and the fungus over a five-day period. They found that early on, infected flies were phenotypically indistinguishable from uninfected flies, making it difficult to track the progression of the infection.

     The researchers believe that this new system will allow them to make rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior. However, they note that further progress will be limited by the lack of established genetic tools in either the fungus or the host, as well as neurobiological tools in the host.
Summary
     Biologists have long understood the importance of RNA degradation in eukaryotic cells, where it plays a crucial role in processing, regulating, and eliminating aberrant or poorly functional RNAs. To gain a deeper understanding of this process, researchers used a technique called photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) to map the binding locations of 30 RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These factors are involved in various aspects of RNA degradation, including deadenylation, decapping, exosome-mediated degradation, and nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA surveillance.

     The resulting transcriptome-wide binding maps revealed how these degradation factors vary in their binding specificities for different classes of RNAs and their preferred locations on RNA transcripts. By comparing these profiles with previously published data on other RNA-binding factors, the researchers identified clusters of factors that co-occupy RNAs or co-localize on RNAs. This information provides valuable insights into how RNA degradation pathways are selected and how the RNA sequence influences this selection.

     The study found that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, while decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Additionally, decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, suggesting that these mRNAs are rapidly degraded due to inefficient translation. The researchers also found that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs).

     This study provides a rich resource for future research on eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism. The detailed bioinformatics analysis and comparisons with previously reported data offer a comprehensive understanding of how RNA degradation factors interact with different classes of RNAs, shedding light on the complex processes involved in RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that plants have a powerful defense system against pathogens, including a compound called camalexin. Camalexin is produced by Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research. When Arabidopsis detects a pathogen, such as a bacterium or fungus, it rapidly produces camalexin to fight off the infection. However, the exact mechanism behind this rapid response was not well understood.

     Researchers used a combination of publicly available data and laboratory experiments to investigate how camalexin biosynthesis genes are activated in response to a pathogen signal. They found that these genes are marked with two types of epigenetic modifications: trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and acetylation of histone 3 lysine 18 (H3K18ac). These modifications have opposite effects on gene expression, with H3K27me3 typically repressing gene expression and H3K18ac activating it.

     The researchers discovered that these two modifications co-occur on camalexin biosynthesis genes, forming a previously unknown type of chromatin called bivalent chromatin. They named this bivalent chromatin "kairostat." By studying mutants with reduced levels of H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the researchers found that both modifications are necessary for the proper timing of camalexin gene induction and metabolite accumulation in response to a pathogen signal.

     The study suggests that kairostat plays a crucial role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression in response to stress stimuli in plants. The researchers also found that kairostat is not unique to camalexin biosynthesis genes, but is also present on other specialized metabolic pathways. Further investigation is needed to understand how transcription factors interact with proteins that deposit or remove epigenetic marks forming bivalent chromatin upon stress signals.

     Overall, this study provides new insights into the regulation of camalexin biosynthesis genes and the role of epigenetic modifications in plant defense responses. The discovery of kairostat opens up new avenues for research into the molecular mechanisms underlying plant defense against pathogens.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the mechanisms that enable specialized astrocytes in the adult brain to retain their ability to produce new neurons. Astrocytes are a type of glial cell that play a crucial role in supporting neurons and maintaining the health of the central nervous system. In a recent study, scientists investigated the role of EZH2, a histone methyltransferase, in neurogenic astrocytes in the adult mouse brain.

     The study found that EZH2 is expressed in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ), a region of the brain where new neurons are produced throughout life. EZH2 is a member of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which plays a key role in regulating gene expression. The researchers discovered that EZH2 is required for neurogenesis, or the production of new neurons, in the SVZ, but its role is distinct from its function in regulating cell proliferation.

     The study also found that EZH2 directly represses the expression of the Olig2 transcription factor, which is critical for neuronal differentiation. In other words, EZH2 helps to prevent the premature activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes, allowing the astrocytes to maintain their neurogenic potential. Furthermore, the researchers found that EZH2 is also expressed in human astroglia and neuronal precursors in the early infant SVZ, suggesting that it plays a key role in postnatal human neurogenesis.

     The study's findings have important implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis. The researchers suggest that EZH2 may be a critical epigenetic determinant for the maintenance of multipotent astroglia, enabling both proliferation and cell fate specification of an adult stem cell population. Future studies may investigate whether re-expression of EZH2 in non-SVZ astrocytes can enable neurogenesis or their directed transdifferentiation into neurons in vivo for potential therapeutic purposes. Overall, the study provides novel insights into the complex role that EZH2 plays in normal development and gliomagenesis.
Summary
     Scientists have long known that viruses play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities and influencing ecosystem functions. However, studying the interactions between viruses and their hosts has been challenging due to the difficulty of cultivating certain microorganisms in the lab. To overcome this limitation, researchers used a technique called single-cell genomics to study viruses infecting a type of bacteria called SUP05 in a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ).

     The OMZ is a region in the ocean where oxygen levels are very low, and it is home to a diverse array of microorganisms. The researchers isolated 127 single cells of SUP05 bacteria from the OMZ and analyzed their genomes to identify viruses that infect them. They found 69 viral contigs, which are fragments of viral DNA, representing five new genera of viruses.

     The study revealed that about one-third of the SUP05 bacteria in the OMZ are infected with viruses. The frequency of infection was higher in areas where oxygen levels were lowest. The researchers also found that some viruses infecting SUP05 bacteria were able to reprogram their host's energy metabolism, suggesting that viruses play a key role in modulating the marine sulfur cycle.

     The study used a combination of single-cell genomics and metagenomics to analyze the interactions between SUP05 viruses and their hosts over a three-year period. The results showed that the viruses persisted in the OMZ for years and remained endemic to the region. The researchers also found evidence of cooperation between different types of viruses, including those with double-stranded and single-stranded DNA.

     The study provides new insights into the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting SUP05 bacteria in the OMZ. The findings have implications for our understanding of the role of viruses in modulating biogeochemical cycling in OMZs, which are critical ecosystems that play a key role in the global carbon cycle. The study also highlights the importance of using single-cell genomics and metagenomics to study the interactions between viruses and their hosts in complex ecosystems.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that cilia and flagella are assembled and maintained by a process called intraflagellar transport (IFT), which involves over 20 IFT proteins. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are not well understood. A recent study focused on a protein called TTC26/DYF13, which is part of the IFT complex B. The researchers used live imaging and biochemical approaches to show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.

     The study found that knocking down TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutating it in C. reinhardtii resulted in short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, the assembly and movement of IFT particles were normal in the mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. However, a specific set of proteins involved in motility was depleted in the mutant flagella.

     Further analysis revealed that TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis, the process of forming cilia, nor for the assembly or movement of IFT particles. Instead, it plays a specialized role in transporting a specific set of motility-related ciliary proteins into cilia/flagella. This is different from most other IFT proteins, which are necessary for assembling cilia/flagella in the first place.

     The study suggests that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery. The researchers also found that TTC26/DYF13 is not conserved in all ciliated organisms, unlike other IFT proteins. Further analysis is necessary to clarify the role of TTC26/DYF13 in determining the length of cilia and flagella. Overall, the study provides new insights into the functions of IFT proteins and the mechanisms of cilia and flagella assembly and maintenance.
Summary
     Lymphatic endothelial cells ( LECs ) play a crucial role in the spread of melanoma, a type of skin cancer, to other parts of the body. Researchers have found that when melanoma cells come into contact with LECs, it triggers a series of molecular changes that enable the cancer cells to become more invasive and spread to distant organs. This process is mediated by a protein called matrix-metalloproteinase-14 ( MMP14 ), which is necessary for the activation of two other proteins, Notch3 and β1-integrin. Notch3 and β1-integrin are involved in cell signaling pathways that promote the growth and spread of cancer cells.

     The study used a combination of laboratory experiments and animal models to investigate how LECs interact with melanoma cells. The researchers found that when melanoma cells were co-cultured with LECs in a 3D matrix, they adopted an invasive sprouting phenotype, which is a characteristic of cancer cells that are able to spread to other parts of the body. This process was dependent on MMP14, Notch3, and β1-integrin.

     The researchers also found that the interaction between LECs and melanoma cells led to an increase in metastasis, or the spread of cancer cells to other parts of the body, in a mouse model of melanoma. This increase in metastasis was dependent on MMP14 and Notch3. Furthermore, the study found that the interaction between LECs and melanoma cells also led to the activation of β1-integrin, which is involved in cell signaling pathways that promote the growth and spread of cancer cells.

     The study provides new insights into the role of LECs in the spread of melanoma and highlights the importance of MMP14, Notch3, and β1-integrin in this process. The findings suggest that targeting these molecules may be a potential strategy for preventing the spread of melanoma to other parts of the body. The study also provides a new model for studying the interaction between LECs and melanoma cells, which can be used to identify new targets for cancer therapy.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in the brain. One miRNA, miR-9, is particularly abundant in the brain and has been shown to be important in the development of neural progenitor cells. However, its role in the growth and development of dendrites, the branching extensions of neurons that allow them to communicate with each other, was not well understood.

     To study the function of miR-9 in dendritic development, researchers created a new mouse model that allowed them to turn off miR-9 in specific brain cells at specific times. Using this model, they found that miR-9 is essential for proper dendritic growth and synaptic transmission, the process by which neurons communicate with each other.

     The researchers also discovered that miR-9 works by targeting a protein called REST, which acts as a brake on gene expression. When miR-9 is present, it helps to turn off REST, allowing genes involved in dendritic growth to be expressed. Without miR-9, REST is not turned off, and dendritic growth is impaired.

     The study found that miR-9 plays a key role in the postmitotic differentiation of neurons, the process by which neurons mature and develop after they have stopped dividing. The researchers also found that miR-9 is important for the development of dendritic arbors, the branching patterns of dendrites that allow neurons to communicate with each other.

     The study suggests that miR-9 is a key player in the genetic programs that control dendrite development, and that its loss can lead to impaired synaptic transmission. The findings have important implications for our understanding of how the brain develops and functions, and could potentially lead to new treatments for neurological disorders.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of miR-9 in dendritic development and synaptic transmission, and highlights the importance of miR-9 in the postmitotic differentiation of neurons. The findings also demonstrate the power of using transgenic mouse models to study the function of specific miRNAs in the brain.
Summary
     Scientists have long known that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often struggle with social interactions and visual engagement, but the underlying causes of these difficulties are not well understood. A new study used brain imaging and eye-tracking techniques to investigate how the brains of young children with ASD differ from those of typically developing children. The researchers found that children with ASD tend to have weaker connections between brain networks involved in social behavior, visual processing, and attention. This is particularly true for a subgroup of children with ASD who show pronounced difficulties with social visual engagement, which can be identified using a simple eye-tracking test.

     The study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brains of over 100 children with ASD and 100 typically developing children between the ages of 2 and 4. The results showed that children with ASD had reduced connectivity between the default mode network (DMN), which is involved in social behavior and self-reflection, and the occipito-temporal cortex (OTC), which is responsible for processing visual information. This reduced connectivity was more pronounced in the subgroup of children with ASD who showed significant difficulties with social visual engagement.

     The researchers also found that the severity of social-communication difficulties in children with ASD was related to the degree of reduced connectivity between the DMN and OTC, but only in the subgroup with pronounced social visual engagement difficulties. This suggests that early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature of this subtype of ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development.

     The study's findings have important implications for the development of early interventions for children with ASD, particularly those with pronounced social visual engagement difficulties. By identifying this subgroup and understanding the underlying neural mechanisms, researchers and clinicians may be able to develop more targeted and effective treatments to support social-communicative development in these children.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that animals have different types of blood cells that work together to keep the body healthy. These blood cells are produced in specialized organs called hematopoietic organs. In fruit flies, called Drosophila, one of these organs is the lymph gland, which produces two types of blood cells: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are similar to macrophages in vertebrates and help clean up waste and debris. Crystal cells, on the other hand, are not well understood and were thought to be produced in a different way than plasmatocytes.

     Researchers wanted to figure out how crystal cells are produced in Drosophila larvae. They found that new crystal cells are made from plasmatocytes through a process called transdifferentiation, which is when one type of cell changes into another type. This process is triggered by a signaling pathway called Notch, which is important for cell development and differentiation. The researchers also found that this process occurs in clusters of cells called hemocyte clusters, which are attached to the body of the fly.

     This discovery is important because it shows that the structure of the hematopoietic organ, in this case the hemocyte clusters, plays a crucial role in regulating the production of different types of blood cells. This is similar to how the structure of hematopoietic organs in vertebrates, such as the bone marrow, influences the production of different types of blood cells. The study of Drosophila hematopoiesis, or the development of blood cells in fruit flies, can provide insights into how blood cells are produced and regulated in other animals, including humans.

     The researchers also found that plasmatocytes are mitotically active, meaning they can divide and produce more cells, and that their numbers increase during larval development through self-renewal. This is in contrast to crystal cells, which were thought to be produced in a different way. The study highlights the importance of studying the structure and function of hematopoietic organs to understand how different types of blood cells arise and how their numbers are controlled. The discovery of the hemocyte clusters as a hematopoietic tissue in Drosophila provides a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems.
summary
     Biologists have long been puzzled by how cells can tolerate the negative effects of aneuploidy, a condition where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes. Aneuploidy is linked to various diseases, but it also plays a role in the evolution of organisms. Researchers have found that laboratory strains of yeast are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, but surprisingly, aneuploidy is common in wild yeast isolates. These wild yeast strains show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes, suggesting that they have a mechanism to buffer the effects of aneuploidy.

     To investigate this phenomenon, the researchers generated diploid strain panels with two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes. They found that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes in these strains. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations, but they show elevated rates of gene amplification. This suggests that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes, allowing them to tolerate aneuploidy.

     The researchers also found that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to some wild yeast strains, such as the oak strain YPS1009. This strain amplifies a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation, giving it a selective advantage. The study presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy, providing a natural route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

     The study provides new insights into how cells can tolerate aneuploidy long enough for new phenotypes to evolve. The researchers found that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression. This reduced expression is due in part to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes, some of which may have been selected for during adaptation to aneuploidy.

     The study also raises the possibility of natural genetic variation in dosage compensation. The expression of dosage-compensated genes is controlled in proportion to gene copy, but many genes escape dosage compensation in response to aneuploidy and can contribute significantly to phenotypic variation. The findings have implications for our understanding of how aneuploidy contributes to the evolution of organisms and how cells can tolerate the negative effects of aneuploidy.
Summary
     Scientists have discovered a new type of light-sensing cell in a type of flatworm called Maritigrella crozieri. These cells contain a protein called xenopsin, which is a type of opsin photopigment. Opsins are proteins that help animals detect light, and xenopsin was previously thought to be part of a different group of opsins.

     The researchers found that xenopsin is expressed in two types of cells in the flatworm: in the eyes of the larva and in extraocular cells around the brain of the adult. The extraocular cells are unique because they contain hundreds of cilia, which are long, thin extensions of the cell membrane, inside a specialized compartment called a phaosome.

     To understand how xenopsin works, the researchers performed experiments in human cells. They found that xenopsin can drive a light-sensing process called phototransduction, which is the first step in detecting light. They also discovered that xenopsin couples with a type of protein called Gαi, which is involved in transmitting signals from the light-sensing cells to other parts of the cell.

     The discovery of xenopsin-expressing cells in the flatworm is significant because it challenges our current understanding of how light-sensing cells evolved in animals. Previous research suggested that light-sensing cells in invertebrates, such as insects and flatworms, were either ocular (in the eyes) or rhabdomeric/microvillar (in other parts of the body). However, the discovery of xenopsin-expressing cells in the flatworm shows that there is a third type of light-sensing cell that is both ocular and extraocular.

     The researchers also found that the xenopsin-expressing cells in the flatworm have a unique ultrastructure, similar to that of rod photoreceptors in jawed vertebrates. These cells enclose their cilia inside their own plasma membrane, which is a characteristic feature of rod photoreceptors.

     Overall, the discovery of xenopsin-expressing cells in the flatworm provides new insights into the evolution of light-sensing cells in animals and highlights the diversity of light-sensing mechanisms in different species. The findings also provide evidence for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms, which was previously unknown.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that spatial and temporal cues play a crucial role in determining the diversity of neurons in the brain. However, it has been unclear how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors, which are the cells that give rise to different types of neurons. To address this question, researchers studied neuroblasts, a type of neural progenitor cell in fruit flies (Drosophila), which are individually identifiable and have known spatial and temporal transcription factors.

     The researchers used a technique called Targeted DamID to identify the genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal transcription factor in two neuroblasts, NB5-6 and NB7-4, which produce different types of neurons. They found that Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the idea that spatial and temporal factors act independently to specify neuronal diversity. Instead, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast.

     The researchers also found that the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. This suggests that early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.

     The study identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4, which are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. The findings support a model in which spatial and temporal factors are integrated in neural progenitors to generate lineage-specific neuronal diversity. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of neurogenesis and has implications for our understanding of how the brain develops and how neural diversity is generated.
Summary
     Scientists have long been trying to understand how a type of ion channel called P2X receptors works. These receptors open a pore in the cell membrane when they bind to a molecule called ATP, allowing ions to flow in and out of the cell. However, the exact mechanism of how this pore opens is still not fully understood.

     Researchers used a new technique called photo-switchable cross-linkers, or "molecular tweezers," to study the P2X2 receptor. They attached these tweezers to specific parts of the receptor and used light to control the distance between them. This allowed them to measure how the receptor changes shape when it binds to ATP.

     The study found that the pore of the receptor opens in a way that is different from what was previously thought. Instead of expanding outward, the inner and outer parts of the receptor's pore-lining helices move closer together. This movement is thought to occur through a "hinge-bending" motion, where the helices bend at a specific point.

     The researchers also found that this movement is essential for the receptor to open and allow ions to flow in and out of the cell. They used computer simulations to create high-resolution models of the receptor in both its open and closed states, which helped them understand the mechanism of pore opening.

     The study provides new insights into how P2X receptors work and demonstrates a new technique that can be used to study other membrane proteins. This technique, called photo-switchable cross-linkers, allows researchers to control the distance between specific parts of a protein and measure how it changes shape in response to different conditions.

     The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of how P2X receptors function and how they might be targeted for therapeutic purposes. They also highlight the potential of photo-switchable cross-linkers as a tool for studying the structure and function of membrane proteins.
Summary
     Biologists have long assumed that all animal cells divide in a similar way, using a contractile ring to split into two. However, new research suggests that this process, called cytokinesis, is more complex and varies between different cell types. A study on the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, a type of worm, found that each cell has a unique way of dividing.

     The researchers used temperature-sensitive mutants and drugs to study how cells divide in the four-cell embryo. They found that one cell, called P2, regulates its own division, while another cell, called EMS, relies on signals from its neighboring cell, P2, to divide correctly. This suggests that both internal and external factors control how cells divide.

     The study also found that the levels and timing of activity of certain proteins, called forminCYK-1 and myosin-IINMY-2, vary between cells. ForminCYK-1 is essential for forming the contractile ring, while myosin-IINMY-2 is a motor protein that helps the ring constrict. The researchers found that forminCYK-1 activity is cell-type specific, but myosin-IINMY-2 activity is not.

     The study used thermogenetics, a technique that allows for precise control over protein activity, to inactivate forminCYK-1 and myosin-IINMY-2 in individual cells. They found that inactivating forminCYK-1 led to division failure in some cells, but not others. In contrast, inactivating myosin-IINMY-2 did not affect division in any cells.

     The researchers conclude that both internal and external mechanisms control how cells divide, and that these mechanisms can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened. This study provides new insights into the complex process of cytokinesis and highlights the importance of cell-type specificity in cell division. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells divide and how this process goes awry in diseases such as cancer.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that bacterial flagella, the whip-like structures that help bacteria move, play a crucial role in how bacteria interact with their hosts and trigger immune responses. However, some bacteria have a unique feature: a membranous sheath that encases their flagella. The purpose of this sheath has remained a mystery, with some scientists hypothesizing that it might help the bacteria evade the host's immune system.

     Researchers have now discovered that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in two types of bacteria, Vibrio fischeri and Vibrio cholerae, leads to the release of a potent molecule called lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This molecule is found in the flagellar sheath and can trigger a strong immune response in the host. The study used a model symbiosis between the bacteria and the Hawaiian bobtail squid to investigate the role of the flagellar sheath in host recognition.

     The researchers found that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both V. fischeri and V. cholerae promotes the release of LPS, which in turn triggers a host immune response. This is a surprising finding, as it was previously thought that the flagellar sheath might help the bacteria evade the host's immune system. Instead, the sheath appears to play a key role in triggering the immune response.

     This discovery has important implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, such as V. cholerae, which causes cholera. It also raises questions about the biophysical function of the flagellar sheath and how it contributes to bacterial virulence. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying the initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis, including the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, the squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS, and the role of flagellin in activating host responses.

     The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between bacteria and their hosts and highlights the importance of the flagellar sheath in mediating these interactions. It also underscores the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying the initiation of symbiotic relationships between bacteria and their hosts.
summary
     Scientists have discovered a previously unknown process in plants called catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination. This process occurs when two plants with different centromere histones H3 are crossed, resulting in the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer. The shattered chromosomes are compartmentalized within a micronucleus and can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also to genetic novelty.

     The researchers used Arabidopsis plants to study this process and found that the shattered chromosomes are formed through breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or stalled fork repair. They also found that mutation of the NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery, suggesting that NHEJ plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes.

     The study provides evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species.

     The researchers also found that NHEJ contributes to the formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny, and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase the elimination of the haploid inducer genome. They hypothesize that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks, and occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued.

     The study provides a tractable, natural system for investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders. The findings have implications for understanding the consequences of mitotic malfunction on genome integrity and the potential for enduring genomic novelty.

Summary
     Scientists have long known that plants produce a wide variety of chemicals to help them survive and thrive in different environments. These chemicals, called metabolites, can be influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors. A recent study looked at how these factors interact to shape the production of specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research.

     The study analyzed data from 797 natural Arabidopsis accessions, or individual plants, collected from across Europe. The researchers found that the production of specialized metabolites varied significantly between accessions, and that this variation was influenced by a combination of geographic location, environmental conditions, demographic factors, and genetic processes.

     The study focused on a specific type of metabolite called aliphatic glucosinolates (GSLs), which are produced by the Arabidopsis plant to defend against pests and diseases. The researchers found that the production of GSLs was influenced by multiple genetic loci, or regions of the genome, and that these loci contained many different alleles, or versions, of the genes involved in GSL production.

     The study also found that the distribution of these alleles varied across Europe, with some alleles being more common in certain regions than others. This suggests that the production of GSLs has been shaped by a combination of genetic, environmental, and demographic factors, including the plant's history of migration and adaptation to different environments.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex interactions between genetics, environment, and demography that shape the production of specialized metabolites in plants. They also highlight the importance of considering multiple factors when studying the evolution of complex traits in plants. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how plants adapt to changing environments and how we can breed crops that are better suited to different climates and conditions.
summary
     Biomedical research has long considered apoptosis, a process of programmed cell death, and its molecular mediators, caspases, as tumor suppressors. However, recent studies suggest that under certain conditions, apoptotic caspases can promote tumor growth and proliferation. A new study in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, has uncovered a mechanism by which caspases can switch from tumor suppressors to tumor promoters.

     In the study, researchers used a well-studied neoplastic tumor model in Drosophila to investigate the role of caspases in tumor growth. They found that oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras (RasV12) maintain tumorous cells in an "undead" state, transforming caspases from tumor suppressors into tumor promoters. Instead of killing cells, caspases in this context promote the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are highly reactive molecules that can damage cells.

     ROS, in turn, recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells, which signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK further promotes and amplifies caspase activity, creating a feedback amplification loop. This loop is necessary for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior. Interfering with the amplification loop significantly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and improves organismal survival.

     The study also found that oncogenic Ras suppresses the apoptotic activity of caspases, keeping tumorous cells in an "undead" state. While caspases may still induce apoptosis in a few tumor cells, they largely promote the generation of intra- and extracellular ROS, which are required for malignant growth and tissue invasion of surviving neoplastic cells.

     The findings of this study extend previous models of the conversion of Eiger and JNK signaling from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles by oncogenic Ras and identify caspases as essential components of this switch. The study suggests that apoptotic caspases can adopt a tumor-promoting role under certain conditions, such as in the presence of oncogenic RasV12 in scrib mutant cells. The tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases is dependent on the generation of intra- and extracellular ROS, which are required for neoplastic behavior of scrib−/− RasV12 clones.
Summary
     A recent study investigated how our perception of social interactions affects the way we experience time. The researchers found that when we watch people interacting with each other, we tend to perceive the time it takes for them to communicate as shorter than it actually is. This effect, known as temporal compression, is stronger in people who are more socially skilled and weaker in those with autistic-like tendencies. The study also discovered that oxytocin, a hormone involved in social bonding, plays a crucial role in this effect. When socially less proficient individuals were given oxytocin, their perception of time during social interactions became more similar to that of socially skilled individuals. On the other hand, when socially skilled individuals were given a substance that blocks oxytocin, their perception of time during social interactions became less compressed. These findings suggest that our subjective experience of time is influenced by our personality traits and social abilities, and that oxytocin is a key player in this process. The study's results have implications for our understanding of social cognition and the role of oxytocin in human behavior. They also raise interesting questions about the relationship between social skills, oxytocin, and our subjective experience of time. The study's findings could have important implications for the development of new treatments for social anxiety disorders and other conditions related to social cognition. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between social interaction, time perception, and oxytocin.
Summary
     The SARS-CoV-2 virus uses its Spike protein to bind to the ACE2 receptor on human cells to cause infection. Mutations in the Spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) have been found in variants of the virus that have emerged worldwide. These mutations can affect how well the virus binds to the ACE2 receptor. Researchers studied the effects of five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N) and two common ACE2 mutations (S19P and K26R) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. They found that most of the RBD mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction, meaning the virus binds more strongly to the receptor. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. The N501Y and S477N mutations are thought to enhance transmission by increasing binding, while the K417N/T mutations may help the virus evade the immune system. The E484K mutation may enhance both binding and immune evasion. The researchers also studied the effects of combinations of RBD mutations found in new variants of the virus, such as the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants. They found that these combinations can also increase the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The study suggests that carriers of ACE2 variants with mutations (S19P and K26R) may be at greater risk of infection and/or severe disease. The findings provide important information on how the SARS-CoV-2 virus interacts with human cells and how mutations in the Spike protein and ACE2 receptor can affect this interaction.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that genes interact with each other to produce complex traits and modify the effects of mutations during development and disease. However, mapping these interactions has been challenging, especially when it comes to understanding the direction of these interactions. A team of researchers has developed a new approach to map directional genetic interactions in a metazoan cell. They used a combination of RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a large genetic interaction map for 21 phenotypic features of Drosophila cells.

     The researchers started by selecting 1367 genes involved in key biological processes such as signaling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation, and protein turnover control. They then co-depleted gene pairs by RNAi in cultured Drosophila S2 cells and used high-throughput imaging to score 21 phenotypes in single cells. By modeling gene-gene interactions, they inferred gene functions and clustered processes by similarity.

     The resulting map revealed a network of regulatory relationships between genes, including an unexpected link between chromatin remodeling and RAS signaling. The researchers found that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex interacts with the Ras pathway, an interaction that is conserved in human cancer cells. This network also reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis, providing a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal, and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle.

     The study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing directional regulatory networks and provides a resource for interpreting the functional consequences of genetic alterations. The researchers demonstrated that directional genetic interactions can be identified at a large scale and mapped to other genomic data sets to identify regulatory relationships. This work has significant implications for understanding the complex interactions between genes and their role in development and disease.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the phenomenon of heterostyly, a type of floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding in plants. In the case of primroses, heterostyly is controlled by a supergene called the S-locus, which determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between different morphs. However, the genetic basis of this adaptation has remained poorly understood until now.

     Researchers have identified a gene called CYP734A50 as the key component of the S-locus supergene that determines the style-length dimorphism in primroses. This gene, which encodes a brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype and is specifically expressed in S-morph styles. The loss or inactivation of CYP734A50 leads to long styles, suggesting that it plays a crucial role in limiting cell expansion and style elongation.

     The researchers found that CYP734A50 arose through a lineage-specific gene duplication and gained style-specific expression in the ancestor of the Primulaceae family. This duplication and gain of expression likely represent the dominant style-shortening mutation that gave rise to the heterostyly adaptation in primroses. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for the style-length dimorphism in primroses and sheds light on the evolution of the S-locus as a complex plant supergene.

     The researchers also found that CYP734A50 is a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism. This discovery opens the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus as an iconic case of a complex supergene. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the genetic basis of heterostyly and the evolution of complex traits in plants.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that kisspeptin and neurokinin B (NKB) neurons play a crucial role in puberty and fertility. These neurons, located in the hypothalamus, send signals to the pituitary gland to stimulate the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which in turn triggers the production of sex hormones. However, the exact mechanism by which these neurons communicate with each other and with GnRH neurons was not well understood.

     Researchers used a technique called optogenetics to stimulate kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (Kiss1ARH) in mice. They found that high-frequency stimulation of these neurons caused the release of two types of neurotransmitters: NKB, which excites other kisspeptin neurons, and dynorphin, which inhibits the release of NKB. This synchronized activity caused the kisspeptin neurons to fire in unison, which in turn excited GnRH neurons.

     The researchers also discovered that the kisspeptin neurons communicate with other neurons in the hypothalamus, called Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons, via the neurotransmitter glutamate. This communication causes the Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons to fire rapidly, releasing kisspeptin, which then stimulates the release of GnRH.

     The study suggests that kisspeptin neurons play a dual role in regulating reproductive function. They drive the episodic release of GnRH through the release of kisspeptin and NKB, and they also excite Kiss1AVPV/PeN neurons via glutamate release to help generate the preovulatory surge of GnRH. This surge is necessary for ovulation and fertility.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying reproductive function and may have implications for the development of new treatments for fertility disorders. The researchers propose that the synchronized activity of kisspeptin neurons and the release of glutamate and kisspeptin are critical for the normal functioning of the reproductive system.
summary
     Biologists have long known that bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining the ability of cells to become any cell type in the body, known as pluripotency. However, the exact mechanisms behind this process were not well understood. A recent study has shed light on how BMP signalling suppresses the differentiation of pluripotent cells into specific cell types.

     The researchers found that BMP signalling blocks the downregulation of a protein called E-Cadherin (Cdh1), which is a key event in the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. They discovered that the loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that suppressing Cdh1 activity can rescue the BMP-imposed block to differentiation.

     The study also showed that BMP signalling acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, making it more difficult for them to become neural cells. This suggests that BMP signalling helps to reinforce the block to neural differentiation.

     The researchers propose that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues, but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues. They explain how a key pluripotency signal, BMP, feeds into this control mechanism.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex process of cell differentiation and the role of BMP signalling in maintaining pluripotency. They also highlight the importance of E-Cadherin in controlling the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation.

     The study suggests that BMP signalling helps to maintain pluripotency by maintaining the expression of Cdh1, which interferes with efficient neural and mesodermal differentiation. Higher levels of BMP also impose a posterior identity that primes cells for mesoderm and is incompatible with a neural fate.

     The researchers also found that the BMP target gene Id1 imposes a proximal posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards mesoderm. This suggests that the ability of Id1 to block neural differentiation is not due to inhibition of a neural-inducing transcription factor or direct activation of mesoderm differentiation, but rather to a shift in the positional identity of pluripotent cells.

     Overall, the study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind cell differentiation and the role of BMP signalling in maintaining pluripotency. It highlights the importance of E-Cadherin in controlling the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation and provides new insights into the complex process of cell fate specification.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the two centrioles of the centrosome in quiescent cells are different from each other in terms of age, shape, and function. However, the mechanisms behind these differences were not well understood. A recent study has shed light on this mystery by identifying a protein called Cep120 as a key regulator of centriole maturation in quiescent cells.

     Cep120 is a protein that is associated with the daughter centriole, one of the two centrioles in the centrosome. The researchers found that when Cep120 is depleted in quiescent mouse and human cells, the daughter centriole begins to mature prematurely. This premature maturation leads to an accumulation of pericentriolar material (PCM) components, including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein, and Cep170. As a result, the centrosome becomes overactive, leading to increased microtubule-nucleation activity.

     The increased microtubule-nucleation activity disrupts the normal trafficking of proteins to the centrosome, leading to the dispersal of centriolar satellites and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. Centriolar satellites are small organelles that play a crucial role in ciliogenesis, the process of forming cilia. Cilia are essential for sensing the environment and transmitting signals to the cell.

     The study suggests that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting the premature maturation of the daughter centriole. Without Cep120, the centrosome becomes overactive, leading to a range of problems, including defective ciliary assembly and signaling. The researchers propose that the loss of Cep120 may contribute to the development of certain ciliopathies, such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome.

     The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of centriole maturation and the regulation of centrosome homeostasis. It highlights the importance of Cep120 in maintaining the balance of the centrosome and preventing premature maturation of the daughter centriole. The findings have implications for our understanding of ciliopathies and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for these diseases.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that neurons and glial cells, such as Müller glial cells (MCs), interact in the developing brain. However, the ways in which they communicate with each other are not well understood. A recent study investigated how neurons and MCs talk to each other in the developing retina, a part of the eye that converts light into signals sent to the brain.

     The researchers used a combination of techniques, including whole-cell recordings and two-photon imaging, to study the interactions between neurons and MCs in the developing retina. They found that retinal waves, which are spontaneous electrical impulses that occur in the retina, induce calcium transients in MCs. Calcium transients are changes in the level of calcium ions inside the cell, which can trigger various cellular responses.

     The study showed that the type of neurotransmitter released during retinal waves determines whether MCs respond with calcium transients. During cholinergic waves, which involve the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, MCs respond to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. In contrast, during glutamatergic waves, which involve the neurotransmitter glutamate, MCs respond to ionotropic glutamate receptors.

     The researchers also used an optical glutamate sensor to show that the decline in MC calcium transients during glutamatergic waves is due to a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. This suggests that neurons and MCs communicate with each other through the release of neurotransmitters from retinal synapses.

     The study found that the proportion of MCs that respond to retinal waves with calcium transients decreases as the retina matures. However, MCs continue to express multiple neurotransmitter receptors, allowing them to respond to different types of neurotransmitters released during retinal waves. This suggests that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation, enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of neuron-glia interactions in the developing retina and highlight the importance of neurotransmitter spillover in enabling communication between neurons and MCs. Further research is needed to determine whether neuronal activity during retinal waves guides the development of MCs.
Summary
     Estimating the time since death, known as the postmortem interval (PMI), is crucial in death investigations. However, current methods, such as forensic entomology, can be prone to errors and biases. Researchers have been exploring the potential of microbes to provide a more accurate estimate of PMI. A recent study used a mouse model system to investigate the feasibility of using microbial communities to estimate PMI. The study found that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable, allowing for PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days over a 48-day period.

     The researchers characterized microbial community changes in three external sites and one internal site in 40 mouse corpses over 48 days. They used a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches to analyze bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes in each sample. The results provided a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system.

     The study built upon previous research by Pechal et al. (2013), which demonstrated that skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of three swine corpses over 5 days. However, the current study expanded upon this work by characterizing microbial community change in multiple sites and providing a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimation of PMI.

     The findings suggest that microbial community data can be used to estimate PMI with a high degree of accuracy. The study's results provide a foundation for further research into the development of a microbial clock for estimating PMI, which could potentially complement or even replace existing methods. The use of microbial communities as a forensic tool has the potential to provide a more accurate and reliable estimate of PMI, which is critical in death investigations.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the incredible diversity of body forms in animals. Despite this diversity, many animals share a common set of developmental genes that play a crucial role in shaping their bodies during embryonic development. One such group of genes is the Hox genes, which are responsible for defining different identities along the front-to-back axis of an animal's body.

     Hox genes work by interacting with another type of protein called TALE transcription factors. These interactions are essential for providing positional information during embryonic development. Interestingly, Hox and TALE proteins are not unique to bilaterian animals, which include animals with a left and right side, such as humans, flies, and worms. They are also found in some non-bilaterian phyla, such as cnidarians, which include jellyfish and corals.

     However, not all non-bilaterian phyla have Hox genes. For example, sponges, ctenophores, and placozoans do not have Hox genes. This raises an important question: how did Hox genes acquire their crucial axial patterning functions during metazoan evolution? To answer this question, researchers used proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages to study the evolution of Hox-TALE interactions.

     Their findings suggest that Hox-TALE networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. This ancestral network was later exploited for patterning functions in bilaterian animals. The researchers propose that Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was co-opted by different contexts of embryogenesis in various eumetazoan phyla.

     The study highlights the importance of Hox genes in providing positional information during embryonic development. Hox genes are expressed along the front-to-back axis of all bilaterian animals, and their patterning roles are thought to have contributed significantly to the morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Overall, the research provides new insights into the evolution of the Hox-TALE patterning system in bilaterian animals.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers used super-resolution microscopy to study the behavior of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in synapses. AMPARs are proteins that play a crucial role in transmitting signals between neurons. The researchers used different-sized fluorescent probes to track the movement of AMPARs within and outside of post-synaptic densities (PSDs), the areas where signals are transmitted between neurons.

     The study found that most AMPARs labeled with small fluorescent probes (about 10 nanometers in diameter) were confined to nanodomains within PSDs and remained stable for at least 15 minutes. In contrast, AMPARs labeled with larger probes (about 20 nanometers or more in diameter) were mostly found outside of PSDs and were highly mobile.

     The researchers also found that the size of the fluorescent probes affected the behavior of AMPARs. Small probes allowed AMPARs to enter stable nanodomains within PSDs, while larger probes prevented them from doing so. This suggests that the size of the probes limited the ability of AMPARs to enter the synaptic cleft, the narrow space between neurons where signals are transmitted.

     The study provides new insights into the behavior of AMPARs and their role in synaptic transmission. The findings suggest that AMPARs can rapidly enter stable nanodomains within PSDs and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. The study also highlights the importance of using small fluorescent probes to accurately track the behavior of AMPARs and other proteins in synapses.

     The researchers used super-resolution microscopy to observe the dynamics of AMPARs in synapses for long periods of time, up to 60 minutes. They found that the localization of AMPARs was predominantly at synaptic regions and that there was typically one nanodomain per synapse. The study provides new information on the behavior of AMPARs and their role in synaptic transmission, and highlights the importance of using small fluorescent probes to accurately track the behavior of proteins in synapses.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia, a condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply. Voltage-gated sodium channels, specifically NaV1.2 channels, play a crucial role in this response, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. A recent study has shed light on this process, revealing that the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) pathway is activated in rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) in response to hypoxia. This activation leads to the SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels, resulting in an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (INa).

     The study found that hypoxia-induced SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels occurs rapidly, within 40 seconds, and is mediated by the linkage of SUMO1 to the channels. This process shifts the voltage-dependence of channel activation, allowing depolarizing steps to evoke larger sodium currents. The study also demonstrated that the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 channels are essential for the early response to hypoxia, as mutation of NaV1.2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme prevented the increase in INa.

     Furthermore, the study showed that SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels is not dependent on sodium flux, as it occurs in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX), a potent blocker of sodium channels. Additionally, the study found that the SUMO pathway tonically controls INa under normoxic conditions, with SUMO1 increasing and SENP1 decreasing the current. The response of INa to hypoxia was also found to be ablated by µ-Conotoxin-TIIIA (CnTX), a potent blocker of NaV1.2 channels.

     The study's findings suggest that the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 channels may be valuable therapeutic targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons. The rapid SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels at the plasma membrane in response to hypoxia provides a potential mechanism for the early response to hypoxia, and the study's results have implications for the development of neuroprotective interventions. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the response of central neurons to hypoxia and highlights the potential for targeting the SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 channels in the treatment of hypoxic brain damage.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have developed a model to understand how temperature affects the transmission of Ross River virus (RRV), a mosquito-borne pathogen found in Australia, the Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. The model shows that RRV transmission peaks at moderate temperatures (26.4°C) and declines to zero at high and low temperatures (17.0 and 31.5°C). This means that RRV transmission is year-round in tropical areas but seasonal in temperate regions, resulting in a nationwide seasonal peak in human cases.

     The researchers used data from two important vector species, Cx. annulirostris and Ae. vigilax, to parameterize the temperature-dependent model. The results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission, where the optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan. However, the upper and lower thermal limits are more uncertain and may be determined by unique traits for different vector-pathogen systems.

     The study found that the strongest statistical signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions where mean temperature varies along the rapidly rising portion of the R0 curve (20-25°C). If mean temperatures vary both above and below the optimum, important effects of temperature may be masked in time series models that fit linear responses.

     The researchers also discovered that upper thermal limits of mosquito-borne disease transmission are primarily determined by vector life history traits with symmetrical thermal performance curves, such as fecundity and survival at various life stages, rather than rate-based traits with asymmetrical thermal performance curves, like biting rate or pathogen development rate.

     Climate warming is likely to increase RRV transmission in temperate areas, where most Australians live, but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change. The study highlights the need to identify transmission optima and limits by characterizing nonlinear thermal responses, rather than assuming that transmission increases with temperature, to more accurately predict geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease.
Summary
     Scientists have long been interested in understanding the role of beta oscillations in the motor cortex, a region of the brain involved in movement planning and execution. Beta oscillations are rhythmic patterns of neural activity that have been observed in the motor cortex for decades, but their relationship to movement has remained unclear. To investigate this, researchers recorded neural activity from the motor cortex of three macaques as they performed a novel neurofeedback task. The task required the animals to bring their beta oscillatory power to an instructed state and then execute an arm reach.

     The results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. This suggests that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow the onset of new movements. The study also found that population neural activity shifted farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were either neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. This indicates that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts.

     The study's findings support the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow the onset of new movements. This is consistent with previous research that has shown elevated beta power prior to and after well-trained movements. However, the study also found that individual unit responses during beta activity were different across tasks, suggesting that the neural mechanisms underlying beta oscillations may be more complex than previously thought.

     Despite these differences, population-level analyses showed that beta oscillations promote a consistent movement-slowing state during both neurofeedback-induced and naturally occurring beta oscillations. This suggests that beta oscillations play a key role in regulating movement onset, and that their effects are not limited to specific task contexts. The study's findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying movement planning and execution, and highlight the importance of considering population-level neural activity in understanding the role of beta oscillations in the motor cortex.
Summary
     TRAF2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the regulation and homeostasis of immune cells. However, its function in adult tissues is not well understood due to the early death of TRAF2-deficient mice at birth. Researchers have long debated the role of TRAF2's RING domain, with some claiming it cannot function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase and others suggesting it requires a co-factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, generated by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1).

     To investigate TRAF2's function in adult tissues, researchers deleted the TRAF2 gene specifically in keratinocytes, the cells that make up the outer layer of the skin. They found that this deletion led to psoriasis-like skin inflammation and epidermal hyperplasia, a condition characterized by thickening of the skin. This inflammation was driven by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the non-canonical NF-κB signaling pathways.

     The researchers also found that TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes were more sensitive to TNF-induced death and produced inflammatory cytokines through the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. This led to the recruitment of immune cells, including neutrophils and IFNγ+ T cells, to the skin, resulting in a psoriasis-like phenotype.

     Importantly, the researchers were able to reverse the inflammatory phenotype by simultaneously deleting both the TNF and NF-κB2 genes. This suggests that TRAF2 plays a crucial role in protecting keratinocytes from cell death and down-regulating inflammatory responses. The study highlights the importance of TRAF2 in maintaining skin homeostasis and provides new insights into the development of psoriasis-like skin inflammation.

     The findings also suggest that TRAF2's function is distinct from that of Sphk1, as deleting Sphk1 did not lead to the same inflammatory phenotype as deleting TRAF2. Overall, the study provides new information on the role of TRAF2 in adult tissues and its potential involvement in the development of psoriasis-like skin inflammation.
Summary
     Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are tiny sacs that store and release neurotransmitters at synapses, the connections between brain cells. After releasing neurotransmitters, SVs are quickly taken back into the cell through a process called endocytosis, and their membranes are recycled to form new SVs. This recycling process is crucial for maintaining communication between brain cells.

     Researchers have long thought that a protein called clathrin plays a key role in this endocytosis process. However, a new study suggests that there may be an alternative pathway for SV recycling that does not involve clathrin or two other proteins called dynamin 1 and dynamin 3. These proteins are involved in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, which are a type of endocytic vesicle.

     The study used special neurons that lacked dynamin 1 and dynamin 3, making them unable to form clathrin-coated vesicles. Despite this, the neurons were still able to form large endocytic vacuoles, called bulk endosomes, which are thought to be involved in SV recycling. In fact, the formation of bulk endosomes was even more efficient in the absence of dynamin 1 and dynamin 3.

     The study also found that the conversion of bulk endosomes into new SVs did not require clathrin or dynamin 1 and dynamin 3. This suggests that there is an alternative pathway for SV recycling that bypasses the traditional clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway.

     The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of how brain cells communicate with each other. They suggest that there may be multiple pathways for SV recycling, and that the traditional view of clathrin-mediated endocytosis may not be the only way that SVs are recycled. This could have important implications for the development of new treatments for neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, which are thought to be related to problems with SV recycling.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have been searching for a reliable way to measure the effects of glucocorticoids, a class of commonly prescribed medications, on the body. Glucocorticoids are used to treat a range of conditions, including inflammation and autoimmune diseases, but their impact on the body is not well understood. A new study aimed to identify biomarkers, or measurable indicators, of glucocorticoid action in the body.

     The study involved 10 participants with primary adrenal insufficiency, a rare disorder in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough glucocorticoids. The participants were given glucocorticoids and then withdrawn from them, and their blood and tissue samples were analyzed for changes in gene expression, microRNAs, and metabolites. The researchers used a multi-omic approach, combining data from different sources to identify patterns and correlations.

     The study found that certain genes, microRNAs, and metabolites were differently expressed during glucocorticoid exposure and withdrawal. A specific microRNA, miR-122-5p, was identified as a potential biomarker of glucocorticoid action. This microRNA was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucocorticoids and was replicated in independent studies with varying glucocorticoid exposure.

     The researchers also identified a transcriptomic profile that was under similar glucocorticoid regulation in both peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue. This profile was validated by comparison to previously published data from cellular assays. The study suggests that miR-122-5p may play a functional role in glucocorticoid action and could be used as a biomarker to measure the effects of glucocorticoids on the body.

     The findings of this study have implications for the development of personalized glucocorticoid therapy and the understanding of disease etiology related to unphysiological glucocorticoid exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity. Further research is needed to confirm the results and explore the potential of miR-122-5p as a biomarker.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that amino acids play a crucial role in activating the mTORC1 complex, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. However, the exact process by which amino acids activate mTORC1 has been unclear. A recent study has shed new light on this process by examining the dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids.

     The study found that amino acids trigger the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes, a process that occurs within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaks within 5 minutes. This translocation is a necessary step for mTORC1 activation, and it is accompanied by the appearance of fluorescent leucine in lysosomes. The study used a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester to visualize the translocation of mTORC1 in real-time.

     The researchers also found that Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTORC1 activity, respectively. Notably, the phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting that mTORC1 may pass through the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere.

     The study's findings provide a dynamic view of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids and suggest that the lysosome is a crucial locus for mTOR activation. The results also highlight the complexity of the process, with multiple sensing mechanisms and regulators involved. For example, leucine is sensed by Sestrin1/2 proteins, while arginine entering the lysosomes via the SLC38A9 transporter is also important for mTORC1 activation.

     The study's use of a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester allowed the researchers to visualize the translocation of mTORC1 in real-time, providing new insights into the dynamics of mTORC1 activation. The findings have important implications for our understanding of cell growth and metabolism, and may lead to new therapeutic strategies for diseases related to mTORC1 dysregulation.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered that modifying a protein called Ovalbumin (OVA) with a specific sugar molecule called LewisX (LeX) changes how it is processed by immune cells called dendritic cells. Dendritic cells play a crucial role in triggering the immune response by presenting antigens, or foreign substances, to T cells. The researchers found that when OVA is modified with LeX, it is directed towards a specific receptor on the surface of dendritic cells called MGL1. This modification enhances the ability of dendritic cells to present OVA to CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight off infections. As a result, the immune response is stronger and more effective.

     The researchers also found that the LeX modification reduces the amount of OVA needed to trigger an immune response, making it 100 times more efficient. Additionally, it eliminates the need for other signals, such as those from Toll-like receptors, to activate the immune response. The study suggests that modifying antigens with specific sugar molecules can influence how they are processed and presented to the immune system, leading to stronger and more targeted immune responses.

     The researchers used a mouse model to test the effects of LeX modification on the immune response. They found that mice immunized with LeX-modified OVA had higher levels of CD8+ T cells than those immunized with unmodified OVA. The study also showed that the MGL1 receptor is essential for the enhanced immune response, as mice lacking this receptor did not respond to LeX-modified OVA.

     The findings of this study have implications for the development of new vaccination strategies. By modifying antigens with specific sugar molecules, it may be possible to create more effective vaccines that trigger stronger and more targeted immune responses. This could lead to improved protection against infections and diseases. The study highlights the importance of understanding how antigens are processed and presented to the immune system, and how this can be manipulated to enhance immune responses.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which bacteria control the growth of mutants within their own populations. The study focused on Burkholderia thailandensis, a type of bacteria that uses a system called quorum sensing to regulate hundreds of genes. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to communicate with each other and coordinate their behavior. The researchers found that quorum sensing also activates a system called type VI secretion (T6S), which produces toxins and immunity proteins. These toxins can kill other bacteria, and the immunity proteins protect the producing bacteria from the toxins.

     The researchers created a mutant of B. thailandensis that was unable to sense quorum signals, and they found that this mutant had a growth advantage over the normal bacteria in liquid broth. However, when the bacteria were grown on a surface, the normal bacteria were able to outcompete the mutant. This was because the normal bacteria were able to use the T6S system to produce toxins that killed the mutant bacteria.

     The researchers found that the T6S system was necessary for the normal bacteria to outcompete the mutant bacteria on the surface. They also found that the T6S system was not active in liquid broth, which is why the mutant bacteria had a growth advantage in this environment. The researchers suggest that the T6S system serves as a form of "police" that helps to control the growth of mutants within the bacterial population.

     This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between bacteria and their environment. It also highlights the importance of quorum sensing and T6S in regulating bacterial behavior and population dynamics. The findings have implications for our understanding of how bacteria interact with each other and their environment, and could potentially be used to develop new strategies for controlling bacterial populations.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that the connection between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a crucial role in cognitive performance. However, the underlying mechanisms of this connection in the developing brain are not yet fully understood. A recent study aimed to investigate the role of glutamatergic projection neurons in the hippocampus in driving prefrontal oscillations in neonatal mice.

     The study used optogenetic manipulation to selectively target glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either the dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus in neonatal mice. The results showed that the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with the intermediate/ventral hippocampus through phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation of pyramidal neurons in the intermediate/ventral CA1, but not the dorsal CA1, was found to boost prefrontal oscillations.

     The study provides causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of the intermediate and ventral hippocampus, but not the dorsal hippocampus, elicits broad band oscillations in the PFC of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections. The findings suggest that the hippocampus acts as a drive for prelimbic activation in neonatal mice, with the intermediate and ventral hippocampus playing a more prominent role than the dorsal hippocampus.

     The study also found that the hippocampal theta drive shapes the maturation of prefrontal-hippocampal networks. The data reveal that sharp wave-ripples from the intermediate/ventral but less from the dorsal part of hippocampal CA1 correlate with pronounced neuronal firing and local entrainment in the PFC of neonatal mice. The study provides new insights into the cellular origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain and opens up new perspectives for assessing the adult behavioral readout of long-range communication in the developing brain.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA, undergoes various post-translational modifications to regulate gene expression. These modifications include phosphorylation of serine residues on the enzyme's C-terminal domain (CTD), which is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats. Phosphorylation of serine-5 and serine-7 marks the initiation of transcription, while phosphorylation of serine-2 is associated with productive elongation.

     In addition to phosphorylation, the CTD also contains non-canonical substitutions of serine-7 into lysine-7, which can be acetylated (K7ac) or methylated (K7me1 and K7me2). Researchers have discovered that K7me1 and K7me2 are present during the earliest stages of transcription and precede or accompany phosphorylation of serine-5 and serine-7. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression.

     The study used new antibodies to detect K7me1 and K7me2 and found that these modifications are present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA. The researchers also showed that mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with viability in mouse fibroblasts, suggesting that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues.

     The study found an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels. The extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications, with methylation being associated with less productive transcription, and K7 acetylation being most enriched at the highest expressed genes. The results suggest that the balance between methylation and acetylation of CTD-K7 residues plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how skeletal muscle satellite cells (SCs) maintain their quiescent state, allowing them to rapidly proliferate and repair muscle tissue after injury. A recent study has shed light on this process by identifying the role of a protein called Tristetraprolin (TTP) in regulating SC quiescence. TTP is an mRNA decay factor that promotes the breakdown of specific mRNAs, including the MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment.

     In quiescent SCs, TTP binds to the 3' untranslated region of MyoD mRNA, leading to its degradation. However, upon muscle injury, the p38α/β MAPK signaling pathway is activated, which phosphorylates and inactivates TTP. This inactivation allows MyoD mRNA to accumulate, enabling SCs to exit quiescence and proliferate to repair muscle tissue.

     The study found that satellite cell-specific knockdown of TTP precociously activates SCs, leading to premature MyoD expression, differentiation, and cell fusion into myofibers. This suggests that TTP plays a critical role in maintaining SC quiescence by suppressing pro-myogenic mRNAs, including MyoD.

     The researchers propose that TTP acts as one of several post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling SC homeostasis. They also suggest that TTP may be involved in down-regulating MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in the reacquisition of quiescence following an injury.

     The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of muscle regeneration and the potential development of therapies for muscle diseases. The identification of TTP as a key regulator of SC quiescence highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation of RNA in skeletal muscle homeostasis. Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying TTP's role in SC quiescence and its potential therapeutic applications.
summary
     Infants with a genetic defect in the interleukin-10 receptor (IL10R) are at risk of developing very early onset inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Researchers investigated whether IL10R regulates the function of a type of immune cell called macrophages in the intestines of infant mice and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is necessary to prevent colitis in infancy. The study found that IL10R-deficient mice did not show signs of colitis during the first two weeks of life, but intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction began during the third week of life, coinciding with weaning and changes in the intestinal microbiota. However, IL10R did not directly affect the balance of bacteria in the intestines. The study showed that depleting macrophages in IL10R-deficient mice prevented the development of colitis, while removing IL10R specifically from macrophages made infant mice more susceptible to colitis. These findings suggest that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is crucial for preventing the development of colitis in infant mice. The study's results have implications for understanding the factors that contribute to the development of IBD in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling. The research also highlights the importance of macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and preventing intestinal inflammation in infancy. The study's findings could lead to a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of IBD in infants and potentially inform the development of new treatments for these diseases. The study's results demonstrate that the requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding the factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling. The study's findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that the IL10/IL10R pathway is essential for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and prevention of intestinal inflammation in infancy. Modeling infantile-onset colitis in mice that lack functional IL10R signaling could lead to significant advances in our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases.
Summary
     Biologists have discovered a protein called SIMR-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in the regulation of transposons and other germline genes. Transposons are mobile genetic elements that can jump from one location to another in the genome, and their regulation is essential for maintaining genome stability. SIMR-1 is a Tudor domain protein that acts downstream of a type of small RNA called piRNA (piwi-interacting RNA) and upstream of a complex called the mutator complex. The mutator complex is responsible for amplifying siRNAs (small interfering RNAs) from piRNA-targeted mRNAs to trigger robust and heritable silencing.

     The researchers found that SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, which are phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. This suggests that multiple perinuclear condensates are involved in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex.

     The study demonstrates that SIMR-1 is required at a step between the piRNA pathway and the mutator complex, similar to how another protein called Krimper coordinates Ago3 and Aubergine during ping-pong piRNA biogenesis in fruit flies. SIMR-1 may function by bridging the gap between the primary and secondary phases of the C. elegans piRNA silencing pathway.

     The researchers also found that SIMR-1 localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci, implicating a series of distinct perinuclear condensates in the regulation of mRNAs by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex. This work identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex, and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that a type of brain cell called Purkinje neurons play a crucial role in the cerebellum, a region of the brain involved in motor control and learning. However, the behavior of these cells in living animals has been difficult to study. A new study in zebrafish larvae has provided the first direct evidence that Purkinje neurons exhibit a property called bistability, where they can switch between two distinct states of activity.

     In the study, researchers recorded the electrical activity of Purkinje neurons in unanesthetized zebrafish larvae using a technique called intracellular recording. This allowed them to observe the neurons' behavior in a more natural state than previous studies, which were often conducted under anesthesia. The researchers found that Purkinje neurons in the zebrafish larvae exhibited bistability, switching between a state of tonic firing and a state of bursting activity.

     The researchers also found that the bistability was dependent on the activation of a type of receptor called AMPA receptors, which are involved in transmitting signals between neurons. Specifically, they found that the activation of AMPA receptors by a type of input called climbing fibers was sufficient to trigger bursts of activity in the Purkinje neurons.

     The study also showed that the bistability of Purkinje neurons is correlated with the activity of motor neurons, which are responsible for transmitting signals to muscles. The researchers found that the initiation of motor neuron spiking was correlated with increased incidence of climbing fiber excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and membrane depolarization in the Purkinje neurons.

     The study's findings suggest that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons across different species, from fish to mammals. The researchers also found that bistability is present in zebrafish larvae as early as 4 days post-fertilization and persists at least until late larval stages.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the behavior of Purkinje neurons in living animals and highlights the importance of AMPA receptors in regulating their activity. The findings have implications for our understanding of the cerebellum's role in motor control and learning.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, where cells internalize molecules and particles from their surroundings. However, the exact mechanisms behind this process have remained unclear. A recent study has shed new light on the principles of self-organization and load adaptation by the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

     The study used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate how the actin cytoskeleton generates force to internalize endocytic pits against the tension of the plasma membrane. The researchers found that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to create sustained internalization of an endocytic pit against physiological membrane tension. This network is composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein, with linker attachments in the clathrin coat and rates constrained by cellular and biochemical measurements.

     The study also showed that actin filament self-organization and bending, which arise from the spatial distribution of actin-coat attachments around the curved endocytic pit, allow the actin network to adapt to changing loads. The researchers found that around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization, and that these complexes accumulate at clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites over time.

     Using a newly developed molecule-counting method, the researchers determined that approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations of the actin network showed that it self-organizes into a radial branched array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Long actin filaments bend between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit, storing elastic energy that contributes to endocytic internalization.

     The study also found that elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production. This adaptive mechanism allows the endocytic actin network to change its organization and force-producing capacity under varying physical constraints. Overall, the study provides new insights into the principles of self-organization and load adaptation by the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the process of macropinocytosis, where cells engulf large amounts of extracellular liquid into large vesicles called macropinosomes. A crucial step in this process is the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropinocytic cup. Researchers have discovered that in the single-celled organism Dictyostelium, macropinocytic cups are organized around intense patches of signaling molecules called PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac. These signaling patches are always associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery.

     The study used advanced microscopy techniques to visualize the formation of macropinocytic cups in 3D and found that the signaling patches are not dependent on the surrounding F-actin ring. In fact, when the RasGAP NF1 is mutated, the signaling patches become enlarged, suggesting that Ras plays an instructive role in their formation. The researchers also found that new macropinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones.

     The study proposes that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. This ring of active SCAR drives the extension of the walls of the macropinocytic cup. The researchers also found that the F-actin in de novo macropinosome cups is closely associated with signaling molecules, including active Ras.

     The study provides new insights into the formation of macropinocytic cups and proposes a general hypothesis for their formation. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells take up large amounts of extracellular liquid and how this process is regulated. The study also highlights the importance of signaling molecules, such as PIP3 and active Ras, in the formation of macropinocytic cups. Overall, the research provides a new understanding of the complex process of macropinocytosis and its role in cellular function.
Summary
     The cohesin ring is a crucial protein complex that holds together newly replicated sister chromatids in eukaryotic cells until they separate during anaphase. A separate complex, Scc2NIPBL/Scc4Mau2 (Scc2/4), is responsible for loading cohesin onto DNA and determining its localization across the genome. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and defects in this process can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, resulting in severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms.

     Researchers have determined the crystal structure of Scc4 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of Scc2, revealing that Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. The study demonstrates that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and build pericentromeric cohesion. This finding shows that Scc4 plays a key role in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establishes a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres.

     The researchers used budding yeast to demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is necessary for recruiting Scc2/4 to centromeres and building pericentromeric cohesion. They created separation of function alleles that uncouple cohesin loading from cohesin targeting to centromeres, showing that cohesin targeting in yeast depends on Scc4. This finding is consistent with unpublished genetic evidence for an Scc4-dependent cohesin localization pathway.

     The study also shows that perturbation of the conserved patch on Scc4 eliminates centromeric localization of Scc2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of the cohesin subunit, Scc1, with the centromere and pericentromere, but not with chromosome arms. This pattern of Scc2 localization is observed in cells progressing through S phase, the stage at which cohesin loading is initiated. The researchers suggest that the Scc4-dependent cohesin targeting they describe is a general feature of the control of cohesin loading, as the pathway that targets cohesin to centromeres requires Scc4 residues that are conserved across diverse eukaryotes.
Biomedical research has shown that being born late in the active season can have significant effects on the growth, fattening, and survival of hibernating animals. A recent study on garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus) investigated the differences in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity between early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juvenile dormice. The results suggest that LB juveniles grow and gain mass twice as fast as EB individuals, but reach lower fat content before hibernation.

The study found that torpor use is low during intensive growth, but increases during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher torpor use, reached similar body sizes, but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. Despite this, LB individuals showed similar patterns of hibernation, but a higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice.

The researchers hypothesized that LB juvenile dormice grow and fatten at higher rates due to a higher use of torpor, and reach similar pre-hibernation levels of body size but a lower body fat content, leading to differences in hibernating patterns and mass losses overwinter compared to EB individuals. The study also investigated the effects of food availability on the rate of growth and pre-hibernation fattening, use of energy-saving strategies such as daily torpor, body size and body fat content prior to hibernation, overwinter hibernating patterns and mass losses, and fecundity at the following spring of female juvenile dormice.

The results of the study are in line with findings on common dormice, which also produce two litters per year, and in which no significant differences in winter survival between EB and LB juveniles were detected. The pre-hibernation fat reserves of LB juveniles in this study were sufficient to fuel their shorter winter duration due to the five-week delay of hibernation start. The study also found that an extensive use of torpor seems to be incompatible with structural growth, but supports pre-hibernation fattening late in the season and the preservation of the fat reserves previously deposited prior to hibernation. This was especially the case for EB juveniles that reached higher levels of fat reserves prior to hibernation, compared to LB individuals. Overall, the study suggests that being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history in garden dormice.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that a type of enzyme called ADAR plays a crucial role in the development and function of neurons in animals. However, the specific genes that ADAR edits to produce these effects were not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, researchers studied the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a single ADAR enzyme called ADR-2. They used a new software tool called SAILOR to analyze the neural transcriptome of C. elegans and identified over 7,300 sites where ADR-2 edits RNA molecules. The researchers found that one of these edited mRNAs, called clec-41, is essential for proper chemotaxis, the ability of the worm to move towards or away from chemicals. When the researchers restored the expression of clec-41 in worms lacking ADR-2, they were able to rescue the chemotaxis defect. This study provides the first evidence that the behavioral phenotypes caused by the loss of ADAR enzymes in C. elegans are due to altered gene expression rather than changes in the amino acid sequence of proteins. The findings suggest that ADR-2 plays a critical role in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans, and that this regulation is essential for proper neural function. The study also highlights the importance of tissue-specific analysis, as changes in gene expression may not be observed in whole worm analysis. The discovery of clec-41 as a critical target of ADR-2 provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying chemotaxis in C. elegans and has implications for our understanding of neural function in other animals.
Summary
     The Influenza A virus (IAV) uses a common strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation and allow the efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Researchers used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore the mechanisms behind IAV-induced host shutoff. They found that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, and instead, the decline in cellular protein synthesis is caused by the viral takeover of the mRNA pool. This means that the virus takes control of the cell's translation machinery, allowing it to produce its own proteins while reducing the production of cellular proteins.

     The study also showed that the levels of cellular transcripts reduction vary, with short transcripts being less affected by IAV infection. These short transcripts are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, which is important for viral propagation. The researchers found that continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is necessary for viral replication.

     The study's findings contradict previous suggestions that IAV uses direct co-opting of the translation machinery to repress cellular mRNA translation. Instead, the viral dominance over the mRNA pool is the main cause of host shutoff. The researchers also found that the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production.

     The study's results provide new insights into the mechanisms of IAV-induced host shutoff and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions. The findings have implications for our understanding of IAV infection and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat the virus. The study's systematic and unbiased analysis demonstrates that viral mRNAs are not preferentially translated compared to their host counterparts, and the extensive translation of viral proteins is the result of viral takeover of the mRNA pool in the cell. The results are consistent with the notion that NS1 is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production.
Biologists have long known that gradients of signaling proteins play a crucial role in shaping the development of tissues and organs. However, the mechanisms behind the formation of these gradients are still not fully understood. A new study in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, has shed light on how these gradients are created and maintained.

In the study, researchers focused on the distribution of a signaling protein called FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) in the larval wing imaginal disc of Drosophila. They found that FGF produced in the wing disc moves to the air-sac-primordium (ASP) through specialized structures called cytonemes that extend from the ASP to the wing disc. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, creating a gradient of FGF that is specific to the ASP.

The researchers also discovered that the transcription factors Pointed-P1 and Cut, which are activated by FGF, play a crucial role in regulating the formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes. Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. This feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport shapes the FGF gradient, allowing it to adapt to the specific needs of the developing tissue.

The study reveals a robust mechanism by which morphogens, such as FGF, can self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion. This mechanism allows for the creation of long-range signal gradients that can regulate tissue morphogenesis. The findings have important implications for our understanding of developmental biology and may provide insights into the development of tissues and organs in other organisms.

The researchers used a combination of genetic and imaging techniques to study the distribution of FGF in the Drosophila larval wing imaginal disc. They expressed fluorescently-tagged FGF and FGFR in the wing disc and ASP, allowing them to visualize the movement of FGF and the formation of cytonemes. The study provides a detailed understanding of how FGF gradients are created and maintained in the developing wing disc, and highlights the importance of cytonemes in long-range cell-to-cell communication.

The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of developmental biology and may provide insights into the development of tissues and organs in other organisms. The study demonstrates the importance of feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated transport in shaping the FGF gradient, allowing it to adapt to the specific needs of the developing tissue.
Summary
     Biologists have long understood the structure of α-helical coiled coils, a common protein fold found in many biological systems. These structures can be precisely described using mathematical equations, making them a prime target for protein design and engineering. However, despite their well-understood nature, researchers have discovered a new type of protein fiber by inserting specific sequences of amino acids into the coiled coil structure.

     The inserted sequences, consisting of two or six residues, cause significant strain on the coiled coil, leading to the formation of short β-strands. These β-strands associate to form a triangular structure called a β-layer, which is a novel supersecondary structure element. The resulting protein fiber, known as an α/β coiled coil, retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the original coiled coil.

     The α/β coiled coil is a new class of protein fiber, characterized by alternating α- and β-structure. This structure is composed of hexads, with three residues in the β and three in the α region of the Ramachandran plot. The β-layers are found repetitively in natural coiled coils, forming regular fibers with alternating α- and β-structure.

     The discovery of the α/β coiled coil has significant implications for our understanding of protein structure and function. It demonstrates that minor mutations to a known fold can result in a substantially novel backbone structure. This finding opens up new possibilities for protein design and engineering, and highlights the complexity and diversity of protein structures. The α/β coiled coil is a novel protein fold that challenges our current understanding of protein structure and function, and has the potential to inspire new approaches to protein design and engineering.
Summary
     Epsin is a protein that plays a crucial role in the process of endocytosis, which is the way cells take in substances from outside the cell. Endocytosis involves the formation of clathrin-coated pits on the cell surface, which then invaginate (fold inward) and eventually pinch off to form vesicles containing the internalized substances. Epsin is an essential component of this process, but its exact function was not well understood.

     Researchers used a genetic approach to eliminate epsin from cells and study its role in endocytosis. They found that the absence of epsin led to a significant impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, resulting in the accumulation of early and U-shaped pits on the cell surface. These pits are an intermediate stage in the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles, but they fail to invaginate and pinch off in the absence of epsin.

     The researchers also found that epsin helps to couple the clathrin coat to the actin cytoskeleton, which is a network of protein filaments that provides mechanical support to the cell. This coupling is essential for the invagination of clathrin-coated pits. In the absence of epsin, the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton is disrupted, leading to the accumulation of shallow and U-shaped pits.

     The study suggests that epsin plays a critical role in the transition between the shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits, helping to generate the force that leads to invagination and fission of clathrin-coated pits. This is a key step in the endocytosis process, and the absence of epsin leads to a significant impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the function of epsin in endocytosis and highlight its importance in the coupling of the clathrin coat to the actin cytoskeleton. The study also suggests that epsin's role in actin regulation may be linked to its function in clathrin-independent endocytosis. Overall, the study provides a better understanding of the complex process of endocytosis and the role of epsin in this process.
Summary
     A recent case-control study in urban Uganda investigated the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren aged 5-17 years. The study found that children born in small towns or cities had a higher risk of developing asthma compared to those born in rural areas. Specifically, children born in small towns had an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 2.16 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.60-2.92) and those born in cities had an OR of 2.79 (95% CI: 1.79-4.35). The study also identified other risk factors for asthma, including higher parental socio-economic status, parental history of asthma, children's own allergic conditions, atopy, and cooking on gas/electricity.

     The study found that children with asthma were more likely to have parents with a tertiary education and a reported history of asthma. Even among children with no parental history of allergic disease, being born in a town or city was associated with an increased risk of asthma compared to being born in a rural area. The risk of asthma increased further in the presence of other risk factors such as atopy and cooking on gas/electricity.

     The study suggests that the risk of asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda is strongly predicted by their area of residence in early life, particularly at birth. The findings have implications for future studies investigating environmental and lifestyle factors that increase asthma risk in urban areas of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Given the rapid urbanization in Africa and other LMICs, the prevalence of asthma is likely to increase further, making it essential to identify specific risk factors and develop targeted interventions to reduce the burden of asthma in these regions.

     The study's results provide a basis for future research to explore the specific environmental and lifestyle factors responsible for increasing asthma risk among children in urban areas of LMICs. By understanding these factors, policymakers and healthcare providers can develop effective strategies to prevent and manage asthma in these populations.
summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the intricate patterns on zebrafish, a type of small freshwater fish. These patterns, which include stripes and spots, are formed by interactions between three types of pigment cells: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this process are not well understood.

     Researchers have identified a protein called Connexin 41.8 (Cx41.8), which plays a crucial role in forming these patterns. Mutations in the gene that encodes Cx41.8, known as leopard (leo), cause a series of spotted patterns in zebrafish. A new mutation, leotK3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting that it has a dominant negative effect on another component of gap junctions.

     Through a genetic screen, the researchers identified this component as Connexin 39.4 (Cx39.4), also known as luchs. They found that loss-of-function alleles of luchs are required for stripe formation in zebrafish, but the fins are almost unaffected. Double mutants and chimeras showed that leo and luchs are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores.

     The results suggest that Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 form heteromeric gap junctions, which promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively. These interactions instruct the patterning of the iridophores. The researchers propose that these gap junctions are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established.

     Zebrafish homozygous for leotK3 or trans-heterozygous for leotK3 over leot1 show an identical phenotype of a completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanophores that hardly cluster together are still present, mostly associated with blue iridophores. This suggests that the dramatic expansion of dense iridophores is an indirect effect, possibly caused by mutant xanthophores covering the iridophores.

     The researchers propose a model in which Cx41.8 and Cx39.4 interact to form heteromeric gap junctions. These channels are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms behind the formation of zebrafish patterns and highlights the importance of gap junctions in this process.
Summary
     The evolution of insect olfactory receptors is a complex process that has been studied extensively in neopteran insects. However, the identity of receptors involved in olfaction in more ancient insect groups, such as apterygote insects and paleopteran insects, remains unknown. A recent study investigated the olfactory system of three insect species: the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata, the firebrat Thermobia domestica, and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium. The study found that Lepismachilis lacks olfactory receptors (ORs) and the olfactory coreceptor (Orco), while Thermobia has three Orco candidates and Phyllium has a fully developed OR/Orco-based system.

     The results suggest that ORs did not evolve as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but rather emerged later in insect evolution. The study also found that the coreceptor Orco evolved after the bristletails split from their last common ancestor with the remaining insects. However, an olfactory system that relies on both ORs and Orco seems to have evolved after the emergence of wings.

     Insect olfactory receptors function as heteromultimers composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and the coreceptor Orco. The study used a combination of approaches to identify the receptors involved in odor detection in these insects and basal insects in general. The results provide new insights into the evolution of the insect olfactory system and suggest that the specific building blocks of olfaction have evolved differently in insects and other animals.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of the insect olfactory system and its adaptation to terrestrial conditions. The results also highlight the importance of studying ancient insect groups to understand the early evolution of the insect olfactory system. The study's species collection provides an excellent model for further research into the evolution of the insect olfactory system.
summary
     Biomedical researchers conducted a study in Myanmar to investigate the effectiveness of mass antimalarial drug administrations (MDA) in reducing the spread of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria. The study took place in four villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border, where MDA had been implemented to combat the disease. The researchers analyzed data on malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in the villages before and after the MDA.

     The study found that individuals living in neighborhoods with low MDA adherence were 2.85 times more likely to experience a malaria episode after the treatment compared to those in neighborhoods with high adherence. This suggests a "herd effect," where the protection provided by MDA extends beyond individual participants to the broader community. The researchers also identified other factors that increased the risk of malaria episodes, including high mosquito biting rates, living with someone who has malaria, and having an asymptomatic malaria infection.

     The study's findings indicate that MDA can have a significant impact on reducing the spread of malaria, even in areas with low individual participation. However, the researchers note that spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, can hinder elimination efforts. The study's results provide valuable insights for policymakers and public health officials working to eliminate malaria, highlighting the importance of achieving high levels of MDA adherence to maximize the effectiveness of the intervention.

     The study also found that the protective effect of MDA lasted longer than the prophylactic effect of the antimalarial drugs themselves, suggesting that the herd effect played a significant role in reducing the spread of malaria. This is the first documentation of a herd effect conferred by MDA for P. falciparum malaria, and the study's findings have important implications for the development of effective malaria control strategies. Overall, the study provides evidence that MDA can be an effective tool in the fight against malaria, and that achieving high levels of adherence is crucial for maximizing its impact.
Summary
     Biologists have long wondered how different species develop their unique characteristics. One key factor is the way genes are turned on and off in different parts of the body. This is controlled by proteins called transcription factors (TFs), which bind to specific DNA sequences to regulate gene expression. To understand how TFs have evolved over time, researchers studied the binding specificities of 242 TFs in fruit flies (Drosophila) and compared them to those in humans and mice. They found that the binding specificities of TFs are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, meaning they are very similar. This conservation extends to subtle details, such as the preference for certain dinucleotide pairs.

     The researchers used a technique called HT-SELEX to determine the binding specificities of Drosophila TFs. They found that fruit flies have almost as complex a repertoire of TF binding motifs as humans. This suggests that TF binding specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. The study also found that TFs that belong to the same structural family generally bind to similar sites.

     The researchers compared the binding specificities of orthologous TFs, which are TFs that have the same function in different species. They found that these TFs have almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding. This suggests that the evolution of TF specificities has contributed to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells.

     The study provides new insights into the evolution of TF binding specificities and their role in animal diversity. It also sheds light on new features of Drosophila TF DNA-binding characteristics. The findings have implications for our understanding of how different species develop their unique characteristics and how TFs contribute to this process.
Researchers have developed a new way to study how the heart and lungs develop together in the human body. This process, called cardio-pulmonary co-development, is critical for the proper formation and maturation of these organs. However, there has been a lack of models to investigate this process in humans.

     Scientists used human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which can become any cell type in the body, to create a model of cardio-pulmonary co-development. They used a step-by-step approach to direct the cells to become both heart and lung cells at the same time. This was achieved by controlling specific signaling pathways, such as WNT and nodal signaling, in the absence of external growth factors.

     The researchers grew the cells in a 3D suspension culture, which allowed them to form micro-tissues that consisted of both heart and lung cells. These micro-tissues, called cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (μTs), were able to separate into distinct heart and lung components when the WNT signaling pathway was turned off. This separation was accompanied by the initiation of heart contractions.

     The study found that the presence of cardiac cells promoted the maturation of lung cells, specifically the formation of alveoli, which are the air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. This suggests that the heart and lungs interact and influence each other's development during embryogenesis.

     The researchers believe that their model will be useful for studying the mechanisms of cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation in humans. This knowledge could lead to a better understanding of congenital heart and lung diseases and potentially inform the development of new treatments. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cardio-pulmonary co-development.
summary
     Biologists have long believed that the rate at which an organism's DNA changes, or mutates, is a fixed trait that evolves slowly over time. However, a new study has found that this is not always the case. Researchers have discovered that the mutation rate in Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, can increase rapidly in response to stressful conditions, such as exposure to high levels of ethanol. This increase in mutation rate, known as hypermutation, allows the bacteria to adapt quickly to the stressful environment and avoid extinction.

     The study found that hypermutation is not a permanent state, but rather a temporary response to stress. Once the bacteria have adapted to the stressful conditions, their mutation rate returns to normal. The researchers also identified cellular mortality, or cell death, as the main driver of this rapid evolution of mutation rates. In other words, cells that are under stress are more likely to die, and the remaining cells that survive are more likely to have mutations that help them adapt to the stress.

     The study used a model system of E. coli exposed to high ethanol stress to investigate the dynamics of hypermutation. The researchers found that multiple mutations interact with each other in complex ways, leading to diverse evolutionary trajectories that allow the bacteria to adapt to the stressful environment. They also identified a range of optimal mutation rates that enable rapid growth under high ethanol stress.

     The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of how organisms adapt to stressful conditions. They suggest that hypermutation is not just a rare event, but a common response to stress that can occur in a variety of settings, including the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. The study also highlights the importance of cellular mortality in driving the rapid evolution of mutation rates. Overall, the research provides new insights into the complex dynamics of mutation rate evolution and how organisms balance robustness and evolvability.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how plants adjust their growth and defense responses to changing environmental conditions. A key player in this process is the SnRK1 kinase, a metabolic master regulator found in plants, animals, and yeast. SnRK1 helps plants respond to low energy conditions by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes and reprogramming gene expression. However, the role of SnRK1 in transcriptional reprogramming in plants was not well understood.

     Researchers have now identified the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 as a key regulator of the starvation response in plants. They found that SnRK1 phosphorylates bZIP63, changing its dimerization preference and affecting the expression of target genes involved in primary metabolism. A bZIP63 knockout mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be complemented by wild-type bZIP63 but not by a version with point mutations in the SnRK1 target sites.

     The study also found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10 is responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 at SnRK1 target sites is crucial for its function in plants, as a mutant version of bZIP63 with these sites mutated could not complement the metabolic and senescence phenotypes of the knockout mutant.

     The researchers also showed that bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator, especially under stress and starvation conditions. They identified SnRK1 as one of the kinases responsible for bZIP63 phosphorylation and found that it targets three highly conserved serine residues in the N- and C-terminus of bZIP63. The phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP63's dimerization and activity in plants.

     The study proposes a molecular model for a phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization partners, which ultimately regulates metabolic reprogramming. The findings provide new insights into the role of SnRK1 in transcriptional reprogramming in plants and highlight the importance of bZIP63 as a key regulator of the starvation response.
Summary
     Biologists have discovered a new way that brain cells communicate with each other. They found a protein called ring finger protein 10 (RNF10) that acts as a messenger between synapses and the cell nucleus. Synapses are the connections between brain cells where information is passed from one cell to another. The nucleus is the control center of the cell where genes are turned on and off.

     RNF10 is activated when calcium signals are sent from the synapse to the cell. This activation causes RNF10 to move from the synapse to the nucleus. In the nucleus, RNF10 helps to turn on genes that are involved in learning and memory. The researchers found that RNF10 is associated with a type of receptor called NMDA receptors, which are important for learning and memory.

     When NMDA receptors are activated, RNF10 moves from the synapse to the nucleus. This movement is important for a process called long-term potentiation (LTP), which is a type of learning and memory. The researchers found that if RNF10 is silenced, LTP does not occur, and the structure of the synapse changes.

     RNF10 is transported from the synapse to the nucleus through a process called importin-dependent transport. Importin is a protein that helps to move molecules from one part of the cell to another. The researchers found that RNF10 interacts with the GluN2A subunit of NMDA receptors, which is important for LTP.

     This study shows that RNF10 is a key player in the communication between synapses and the nucleus. It helps to turn on genes that are involved in learning and memory, and is important for the structure and function of synapses. The discovery of RNF10 as a synaptonuclear messenger has important implications for our understanding of how the brain learns and remembers.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how enzymes called Swi2/Snf2 ATPases help regulate the structure and function of chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes. These enzymes play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. To better understand how Swi2/Snf2 ATPases work, researchers have been studying a specific enzyme called Mot1, which is a single subunit remodeler that dissociates TATA box-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes.

     In a new study, scientists have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2). The results show that Mot1 reduces the interactions between DNA and NC2, and also unbends the DNA compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state. This suggests that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner.

     The study also used electron microscopy and cross-linking data to reveal that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2. This finding provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex.

     Swi2/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein:DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex. The researchers found that the association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes, which may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism.

     The study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex. The findings offer new insights into the structural basis for recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex by Mot1, and provide a framework for understanding the mechanisms of Swi2/Snf2 ATPases in general.
Summary
     Scientists have discovered a new way to kill cancer cells by targeting a protein called elongation factor-1A (eEF1A). This protein is essential for cells to make new proteins, and cancer cells rely heavily on it to grow and multiply. The researchers found that a natural compound called ternatin and its synthetic variants can bind to the eEF1A protein and prevent it from working properly. This stops the cancer cells from making new proteins and eventually kills them.

     Ternatin is a cyclic peptide, a type of molecule that has evolved to target specific proteins in cells. The researchers designed new versions of ternatin that are up to 500 times more potent than the original compound. They used a special tool called a photo-affinity probe to identify the eEF1A protein as the target of ternatin and its variants.

     The researchers found that the eEF1A protein forms a complex with two other molecules, GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA, and that ternatin binds to this complex. They also discovered that two other natural compounds, didemnin and cytotrienin, can bind to the eEF1A complex as well. This suggests that the eEF1A complex is a common target for natural compounds that have evolved to kill cancer cells.

     The researchers tested the ability of ternatin and its variants to inhibit protein synthesis in cells and found that they were effective. They also found that mutations in the eEF1A protein that prevent it from binding to ternatin make cells resistant to the compound's effects. This suggests that the eEF1A protein is a key target for ternatin and its variants.

     The discovery of the eEF1A complex as a target for ternatin and its variants opens up new possibilities for developing cancer treatments. The researchers suggest that these compounds could be used as leads for future medicinal chemistry efforts to develop new cancer therapies. The simplicity and accessibility of ternatin and its variants make them attractive candidates for further study and development.
Summary
     Scientists have been studying a genetic disorder called Lowe syndrome, which is caused by mutations in the OCRL gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein called OCRL, which plays a crucial role in the process of endocytosis. Endocytosis is how cells take in substances from outside the cell by engulfing them in a membrane-bound sac called a vesicle. Clathrin-coated vesicles are a type of vesicle involved in endocytosis, and they are coated with a protein called clathrin.

     In this study, researchers investigated the role of OCRL in clathrin-coated pit dynamics and uncoating. Clathrin-coated pits are the precursors to clathrin-coated vesicles, and uncoating is the process by which the clathrin coat is removed from the vesicle. The researchers used cells from patients with Lowe syndrome to study the effects of OCRL mutations on clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

     They found that the absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs the dynamics of clathrin-coated pits and results in an endocytic defect. This means that the cells have trouble taking in substances from outside the cell. The researchers also found that the cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat, and these vesicles nucleate actin comets. Actin comets are structures composed of actin filaments that are involved in cell movement and division.

     The study suggests that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor, which means it helps to remove the clathrin coat from the vesicle. Without OCRL, the clathrin coat remains on the vesicle, and the vesicle is unable to complete the endocytic reaction. The researchers also found that a protein called SNX9, which is associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds to OCRL.

     These findings indicate that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to the pathology of Lowe syndrome. The study provides new insights into the role of OCRL in endocytosis and highlights the importance of uncoating in the endocytic process. The results suggest that OCRL plays a critical role in facilitating the recycling of endocytic factors, which is necessary for the normal progression of endocytosis.
Biomedical researchers have identified a new pathway that contributes to the development of colorectal cancer. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is known to play a significant role in colorectal cancer, but finding effective treatments has been a challenge. To better understand this pathway, scientists investigated the role of FAK (focal adhesion kinase) and PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2) in regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

The study found that FAK and PYK2 are elevated in adenomas (benign tumors) in mice and human colorectal cancer tissues. These proteins work together to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3β (glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta), a protein that normally helps break down β-catenin. When GSK3β is phosphorylated at the Y216 site, it loses its ability to degrade β-catenin, leading to an accumulation of β-catenin in the cell. This accumulation is a hallmark of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and is associated with the development of colorectal cancer.

The researchers used a genetic model of colorectal cancer, APCmin/+ mice, to study the effects of FAK and PYK2 on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. They found that inhibiting FAK and PYK2 with a specific inhibitor, PF-562271, reduced the formation of adenomas in the mice and decreased the levels of phosphorylated GSK3βY216 and β-catenin in the intestine. This suggests that the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in colorectal cancer.

The study also found that the loss of functional APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein, which normally regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, leads to the expression of FAK and PYK2. These proteins then phosphorylate GSK3βY216, stabilizing β-catenin and initiating intestinal tumorigenesis. The researchers propose that FAK and PYK2 work redundantly to regulate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, and that inhibiting these proteins could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating colorectal cancer.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers investigated how humans transition between different motor states, such as standing still and walking. They focused on the role of the vestibular system, which helps us maintain balance and stability. The study used electrical vestibular stimuli (EVS) to test how the vestibular system responds during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion, as well as between two standing postures.

     The researchers found that before transitioning between motor states, the vestibular system's balance-stabilizing mechanisms are temporarily suspended. This means that humans "stop balancing" before they start moving and "stop moving" before they start balancing again. This suspension of vestibular-evoked responses is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it is a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states.

     The study used time-frequency analyses to quantify the relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces during the transitions. Discontinuities in this relationship were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results support the idea that optimal feedback theory, which suggests that transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another, is correct.

     The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion. Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture. To transition between two motor states, balance-correcting responses are disrupted, and the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended.

     The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies. During quiet standing, whole-body accelerations and oscillations within the limits of the base of support are small, and an adaptive feedback controller is used. In contrast, locomotion requires a different control policy, and the vestibular control of balance during locomotor or posture-to-posture transitions can be monitored by continuously quantifying the magnitude of vestibular-evoked balance responses over the transition.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that many living organisms have an internal clock that regulates their behavior and physiology in response to the 24-hour day-night cycle. In cyanobacteria, a type of photosynthetic bacteria, this internal clock is controlled by a protein called RpaA. RpaA acts as a master regulator of gene expression, turning genes on and off at specific times of the day to help the bacteria adapt to changing light conditions.

     In a recent study, researchers deleted the gene that codes for RpaA in cyanobacteria and found that the bacteria were unable to survive in environments where light and dark periods alternate. However, the bacteria were fine in constant light conditions. This suggests that RpaA plays a crucial role in helping the bacteria prepare for and respond to changes in light availability.

     The researchers found that the RpaA-deficient bacteria were unable to accumulate energy reserves during the day and were unable to use these reserves at night. This led to a severe reduction in the bacteria's fitness, or ability to survive and reproduce. However, when the researchers provided the bacteria with an external source of energy, they were able to restore the bacteria's energy levels and viability.

     The study suggests that the circadian output pathway, controlled by RpaA, is essential for coordinating the bacteria's metabolism with the changing light conditions. The pathway helps the bacteria anticipate and prepare for periods of darkness by accumulating energy reserves during the day and switching to carbon catabolism at dusk. This allows the bacteria to produce energy and sustain their viability during periods of darkness.

     The findings provide new insights into the role of the circadian system in enhancing the fitness of cyanobacteria. The study highlights the importance of the circadian output pathway in coordinating central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment. The research has implications for our understanding of how living organisms adapt to changing environmental conditions and may have broader applications in fields such as agriculture and biotechnology.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long understood the importance of transition metals, such as zinc, in all living organisms. However, excessive amounts of these metals can be toxic. To maintain a balance, cells use P-type (PIB) ATPases to transport these ions across cellular membranes. A subclass of PIB-ATPases, known as PIB-4, plays a crucial role in this process, but its structure and function have remained elusive.

     A recent study has shed light on the structure and mechanism of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1. The researchers found that PIB-4-ATPases lack classical heavy-metal-binding domains (HMBDs), which are typically found in other P-type ATPases. Instead, they have a unique eight-helix M-domain configuration.

     The study also revealed that PIB-4-ATPases have a dual role in heavy-metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. Furthermore, the researchers found that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium-independent, which contrasts with many other P-type ATPases.

     The metal specificity of PIB-4-ATPases remains unclear, as some members have been shown to transport cobalt, while others transport a broader range of ions, including zinc, nickel, copper, and calcium. The ability to adapt to environmental changes in heavy-metal levels is essential for all cells, and PIB-ATPases play a critical role in this process.

     The study provides new insights into the structure and mechanism of PIB-4-ATPases, which could have implications for drug discovery and the development of tools to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants. The researchers also identified new inhibitory compounds that could be used to target PIB-4-ATPases, which function as virulence factors in many pathogens. Overall, the study advances our understanding of PIB-4-ATPases and their role in maintaining heavy-metal homeostasis in cells.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that some genes in mammals are expressed from only one of the two copies (alleles) in every cell, a phenomenon called monoallelic expression (MAE). However, studying MAE has been challenging due to its clonal nature. Researchers have now identified a chromatin signature that can accurately distinguish MAE genes in human cells. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of two specific chromatin marks: H3K36me3, associated with active transcription, and H3K27me3, associated with silencing, in the gene body.

     The researchers applied this approach to various cell types and found that around 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes showed the MAE chromatin signature. Notably, this signature was enriched among key developmental genes that have a bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. The study suggests that MAE is linked to cell differentiation and provides a new approach to studying MAE that is independent of genetic polymorphisms.

     The researchers also found that the MAE chromatin signature is present in a large fraction of bivalent genes, which are genes that are silent in embryonic stem cells but become active in differentiated cells. Upon activation, these master regulator genes preferentially resolve into a state with the characteristic MAE chromatin signature. The study's findings open up new possibilities for analyzing MAE in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissues, and may shed light on the mechanisms underlying various human diseases. The chromatin signature can be used to identify MAE genes without relying on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or sample clonality, making it a valuable tool for future research.

     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new way that certain proteins called AAA+ chaperones control their activity. AAA+ chaperones are essential for many cellular processes, but they can also cause harm if not regulated properly. A team of scientists studied a specific AAA+ chaperone called ClpC, which plays a crucial role in bacterial virulence and stress resistance. They found that ClpC's activity is controlled by a unique mechanism involving coiled-coil domains.

     ClpC forms large assemblies with other ClpC molecules through head-to-head contacts between these coiled-coil domains. In its resting state, ClpC is inactive and unable to bind to substrates or other proteins. However, when the adaptor protein MecA binds to the coiled-coil domains, it stimulates ClpC's ATPase activity and allows it to form an active planar ring structure.

     The researchers used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize the structures of ClpC with and without MecA. They found that the coiled-coil domains play a key role in regulating ClpC's activity by sequestering the protein in an inactive state. Mutating the coiled-coil domains in ClpC or a related protein called ClpE caused severe cellular toxicity, suggesting that this regulatory mechanism is essential for controlling AAA+ chaperone activity.

     This study provides new insights into the regulation of AAA+ chaperones and highlights the importance of coiled-coil domains in controlling protein activity. The findings have implications for the development of antimicrobial therapies, as AAA+ chaperones like ClpC are essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance. The discovery of this regulatory mechanism also extends the role of coiled-coil domains as regulatory devices controlling protein activity.

     The researchers' findings suggest that coiled-coil domains can control AAA+ chaperone activity by sequestering the protein in an inactive state. This is in contrast to other AAA+ chaperones, such as ClpB/Hsp104, which use a different regulatory mechanism involving head-to-tail interactions between coiled-coil domains. The study provides a new understanding of the complex regulation of AAA+ chaperones and highlights the importance of coiled-coil domains in controlling protein activity.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how stem cells remain in a dormant state and how they are reactivated. A recent study in Drosophila, the fruit fly, has shed light on this process by examining the behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs), the stem cells responsible for muscle growth and regeneration. Researchers found that AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting that muscles may play a role in AMP reactivation.

     The study revealed that muscles send signals to AMPs through the Insulin pathway, which activates the Notch signaling pathway. Notch, in turn, regulates the activity of dMyc, a protein that promotes cell proliferation. The researchers found that dMyc is essential for AMP reactivation and proliferation, and that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch.

     The study suggests that muscles behave as a niche for AMPs, providing the necessary signals for their reactivation. The Insulin-Notch-dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs, allowing them to proliferate and provide a source of myoblasts for muscle growth and regeneration.

     The findings have implications for our understanding of muscle development and regeneration in both Drosophila and vertebrates. The study provides evidence that the same set of genes, including Insulin, Notch, and dMyc, regulate muscle stem cell behavior in both Drosophila and vertebrates. The research also highlights the importance of the muscle niche in reactivating dormant stem cells and promoting muscle growth and regeneration.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that certain neurons in the brain fire spontaneously at high rates, which is crucial for their function in brain circuits. One type of neuron, the GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), provides tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas. However, the molecular basis of this firing pattern has remained poorly understood. Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons and discovered that they express a sodium leak channel called NALCN. They found that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing, suggesting that NALCN is essential for the tonic activity of these neurons.

     The researchers also found that NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Glycolysis is the process by which cells break down glucose to produce energy. The findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN. The basal ganglia is a group of structures in the brain that play a critical role in movement control.

     To identify the molecular basis of the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons, the researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the gene expression profile of SNr neurons. They found that NALCN was the highest expressed nonselective cation channel (NSCC) in SNr neurons. Nonselective cation channels are channels that allow positively charged ions to pass through the cell membrane.

     The researchers also found that SNr neurons require NALCN for appropriate tonic firing, suggesting that NALCN mutations could contribute to basal ganglia-related motor disorders. For example, disruption of the normal tonic firing of SNr neurons by injection of GABA receptor agonists leads to excessive muscle tension and dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions.

     In addition, the researchers found that SNr neurons express Unc80, Unc79, and Fam155a, three genes whose protein products are known to interact with NALCN. These findings suggest that NALCN plays a critical role in the function of SNr neurons and that disruption of NALCN could have significant consequences for brain function.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long relied on antibiotics developed from a limited number of culturable microorganisms to combat bacterial infections. However, the rise of antibiotic resistance has made these compounds less effective, while the vast majority of microbial diversity remains inaccessible for cultivation and exploration. To address this issue, scientists have developed a new method for cultivating and prioritizing antibiotic producers from natural microbial communities.

     The new approach uses a droplet-based microscale cultivation system that allows for high-throughput screening of antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. This system consists of tiny droplets, each containing a single cell, which are incubated in a growth substrate designed to mimic environmental conditions. The droplets are then screened for antimicrobial activity using bacterial reporter strains, allowing researchers to identify potential antibiotic producers.

     In a proof-of-concept study, the researchers verified their cultivation and screening strategy by culturing a complex bacterial community derived from a soil sample. They compared the results to classical agar plate cultivation and found that the droplet-based system yielded a significantly higher bacterial diversity and allowed for the cultivation of previously uncultured species. One of the isolates that showed antimicrobial activity was further characterized, and its secreted metabolites were identified.

     The droplet-based system offers several advantages over traditional cultivation methods. Microfluidic droplets provide a genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products, meaning that compounds stay confined with the cell from which they originated. This allows researchers to store and incubate large droplet populations under controlled conditions. Additionally, the system enables high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products using bacterial reporter strains.

     The combination of bacterial strain discovery during the in-droplet cultivation phase with subsequent selection of the most auspicious candidates for natural product biosynthesis will streamline efforts towards new scaffold structures for the development of antibiotics. Even though axenic cultures of putative new species could not be maintained with standard microbiological cultivation after isolation from droplets, the cells could be used for obtaining high-quality genome information. This innovative approach has the potential to revolutionize the discovery of new antibiotics and combat the growing threat of antibiotic resistance.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have been studying the link between a specific gene variant and survival rates in patients with tuberculous meningitis (TBM). TBM is a severe form of tuberculosis that causes inflammation in the brain, leading to high mortality rates. While corticosteroids have been shown to reduce mortality by 30%, they do not benefit all patients equally. A study in Vietnam found that patients with a specific variant of the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) gene had improved survival rates when treated with corticosteroids. However, a similar study in Indonesia did not find the same association.

     Using a statistical method called Bayesian analysis, researchers re-examined the data from both studies and found that the LTA4H gene variant does indeed confer a survival benefit in both populations. This benefit is most pronounced in patients with less severe disease and is nullified in those with more severe cases. The researchers suggest that genotyping patients for the LTA4H variant, combined with assessing the severity of their disease, could help target corticosteroid treatment to those most likely to benefit from it.

     The study's findings have important implications for the treatment of TBM. Currently, corticosteroids are given to all patients with TBM, regardless of their genetic makeup or disease severity. However, this approach may not be effective for all patients. By identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from corticosteroids, clinicians may be able to improve treatment outcomes and reduce mortality rates. The study's results also highlight the importance of considering individual genetic differences in the treatment of complex diseases like TBM.

     The researchers propose that the lack of association between the LTA4H gene variant and survival in the Indonesia study may be due to the fact that the patients in this study had more severe disease and died earlier. This may have meant that the beneficial effects of corticosteroids were not given enough time to take effect. Alternatively, it is possible that the patients in the Indonesia study had a different underlying inflammatory response that was not responsive to corticosteroids. Further research is needed to fully understand the relationship between the LTA4H gene variant and survival in TBM patients.
Summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by how nerve cells, or neurons, navigate their way through the developing brain to form connections with other cells. One key player in this process is a molecule called netrin-1, which helps guide axons, the long extensions of neurons, to their correct destinations. However, the exact mechanism by which axons read and respond to netrin-1 signals has remained unclear.

     Researchers have discovered that a protein called shootin1 plays a crucial role in this process. In mice, knocking out the gene for shootin1 resulted in abnormal axon projections in the forebrain, similar to what is seen in mice lacking netrin-1. Further investigation revealed that shootin1 is highly expressed in developing forebrain axons and that small differences in netrin-1 concentration can trigger highly polarized phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones, the dynamic structures at the tip of axons.

     The study found that netrin-1-elicited shootin1 phosphorylation promotes interaction between shootin1 and a cell adhesion molecule called L1-CAM, leading to the generation of forces necessary for growth cone migration. Importantly, disrupting the spatially regulated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones inhibited axon turning in response to netrin-1 gradients, but not axon outgrowth. This suggests that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance.

     The researchers also showed that the interaction between shootin1 and L1-CAM is necessary for netrin-1-induced axon guidance, and that this interaction is not limited to growth cones on L1-CAM. Furthermore, they found that uncoupling of F-actin-adhesion coupling by shootin1 inhibited netrin-1-induced axon outgrowth and turning. Overall, the study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and highlights the importance of shootin1 phosphorylation in reading and responding to netrin-1 gradients for axon guidance.
Summary
     Scientists have long been fascinated by the unique humming sound produced by hummingbirds in flight. To understand how this sound is generated, researchers studied six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds using a 2176 microphone array and a new aerodynamic force platform. The platform directly measured the 3D aerodynamic forces on the birds' wings, while the microphone array recorded the acoustic nearfield around the birds.

     The researchers developed an idealized acoustic model that integrated the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics. This model showed that the timbre of the hummingbird's hum arises from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. The study found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of the birds' flapping wings originate from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their body weight.

     The researchers also compared their findings with those of insects, such as mosquitoes, and found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of their flapping wings also originate from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces. However, the study found that larger birds are quieter and elongated flies are louder due to allometric deviation.

     The researchers used a new aerodynamic force platform to directly measure the net 3D aerodynamic force generated by freely hovering hummingbirds. They integrated this data into a new aeroacoustics model to predict the sound radiated due to the oscillating forces from flapping wings. The measurements and model showed that hovering hummingbirds generate a highly directional hum, with the broadband acoustic pressure primarily oriented downward opposing gravity.

     The study's findings suggest that oscillating aerodynamic forces play a key role in generating the wing hum of hummingbirds and other animals in flapping flight. The researchers used numerical simulation of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic equation to show that the farfield hum of flapping mosquito wings is primarily driven by aerodynamic force fluctuation. The study's results provide new insights into the complex bioacoustic behavior of animals in flight.
Summary
     Biologists have long debated the roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in evolution. Chance refers to random genetic mutations, necessity refers to the physical and chemical laws that govern the behavior of molecules, and contingency refers to the unpredictable events that shape the course of evolution. A recent study used a new technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family to understand how these factors contribute to the evolution of protein-protein interactions.

     The researchers reconstructed ancestral proteins from the BCL-2 family and used a continuous evolution technology to mutate and select them to acquire specific protein-protein interaction (PPI) specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins, the study found that contingency generated over long historical timescales steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation.

     The results suggest that patterns of variation in BCL-2 sequences are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events. In other words, the sequences of present-day BCL-2 family proteins reflect the interaction of accumulated chance events during descent from common ancestors with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and natural selection.

     The study also found that contingency generated by sequence change over phylogenetic timescales plays a profound role in BCL-2 family protein sequence evolution under laboratory selection for new functions. The researchers used human BID and NOXA as fixed binding partners, but in real evolution, these proteins would have varied in sequence, introducing opportunities for chance and contingency to further affect the sequence outcomes of BCL-2 evolution.

     The results indicate that the paths through sequence space leading to historical PPI specificities changed repeatedly during the BCL-2 family's history, even during intervals when the proteins' PPI binding profiles did not evolve. For chance to strongly influence the outcomes of adaptive evolution, multiple paths to a selected phenotype must be accessible with similar probabilities of being taken. The study's findings suggest that present-day BCL-2 family proteins, and potentially many others, are largely physical anecdotes of their particular unpredictable histories.
Summary
     A recent study analyzed the genetic diversity of 48 sub-Saharan African groups to understand the history of gene flow and admixture in the region. The researchers used a genome-wide, haplotype-based approach to identify shared ancestry between different population groups. They found that many sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups from outside their current geographic region, resulting from gene flow within the last 4,000 years.

     The study revealed that coastal populations in sub-Saharan Africa experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7,000 years. Additionally, Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans due to recent population expansions. The researchers also identified smaller groups and differentiated closely related populations, consistent with self-reported ancestry.

     The study provides new insights into the movement of alleles and haplotypes into and within sub-Saharan Africa. The findings suggest that admixture is a common feature of human populations across the globe, and genome-wide analyses of African populations are refining previous models of the continent's history and its impact on genetic diversity. The study's results have implications for studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa.

     The researchers used a dataset from the African Genome Variation Project, which included 18 ethnic groups from eight countries. They analyzed the data to identify the dominant events that have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa. The study's findings highlight the complex history of gene flow and admixture in the region, with evidence of Eurasian ancestry moving back into the continent over various timescales.

     The study's results provide a quantitative measure of the coancestry between groups and identify the dominant events that have shaped current genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa. The researchers close by discussing the relevance of these observations to studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa. The study's findings have important implications for understanding the genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa and its impact on contemporary populations.
summary
     Biologists have long been puzzled by how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell size during early animal development. The mitotic spindle is a complex structure composed of microtubules that separates chromosomes during cell division. In the early stages of development, cells undergo rapid cleavages, resulting in a significant decrease in cell size. However, the mechanism by which the spindle adapts to these changing cell dimensions is not well understood.

     To address this question, researchers created an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts from Xenopus laevis embryos that recapitulates the in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 and stage 8 embryos. They found that the kinesin-13 protein kif2a plays a crucial role in scaling the spindle during Xenopus development. Kif2a is a microtubule-destabilizing protein that is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α. However, in stage 8 spindles, importin α partitions to a membrane pool, allowing kif2a to become activated.

     The researchers discovered that altering spindle size in developing embryos impairs spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remains robust. This suggests that spindle size is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization. By reconstituting spindle formation in embryo extracts, the researchers were able to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle size with cell size during Xenopus development.

     The study also found that spindle size plays an important role in maintaining spindle orientation in the large cells of early Xenopus development. The researchers suggest that the changing physical features of the cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and steady-state redistribution of activities. This mechanism is consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of spindle size during vertebrate embryogenesis. The researchers created an embryo extract system capable of assembling spindles in cytoplasmic extracts at any stage of X. laevis development up to the midblastula transition. This system allowed them to test the functional significance of spindle size control during development. The study suggests that changes in gradients and spindle assembly pathways are likely to accompany cell size changes and could influence spindle size.
Summary
     Biologists have discovered a new way that bacteria control the production of a key molecule called purine. Purine is a building block of DNA and RNA, and its production is tightly regulated in cells. The researchers found that certain RNA molecules, called riboswitches, can work together to form a "logic gate" that senses the presence of two different molecules: guanine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP). This logic gate is like a simple computer chip that can make decisions based on the presence or absence of these two molecules.

     The riboswitches are made up of two parts: one that senses guanine and another that senses PRPP. When both molecules are present, the logic gate is activated, and the production of purine is turned on. If either molecule is missing, the logic gate is not activated, and purine production is turned off. This is an example of a Boolean logic gate, which is a fundamental concept in computer science.

     The discovery of this logic gate is significant because it shows that ancient RNA molecules, which are the precursors to modern DNA and RNA, could have controlled complex metabolic processes without the help of proteins. In fact, the researchers suggest that RNA World organisms, which are thought to have existed over 4 billion years ago, may have used similar logic gates to regulate their metabolism.

     The researchers used a technique called in-line probing to study the behavior of the riboswitches. They found that the logic gate function of the tandem riboswitch is accomplished through interactions between the two aptamers and the adjoining expression platform. The aptamers are the parts of the riboswitch that bind to the molecules, and the expression platform is the part that controls the production of purine.

     The discovery of this logic gate is also significant because it shows that RNA molecules can form complex chemical sensing and regulatory functions. The researchers suggest that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates may be represented by tandem riboswitches that have yet to be discovered in modern cells. This could have important implications for our understanding of the evolution of life on Earth.
Biologists have long known that the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential determines the reliability of synaptic transmission. However, the source of the variability in this fundamental property has been unclear. Researchers have proposed that the release of a single vesicle (univesicular release, UVR) or multiple vesicles (multivesicular release, MVR) reflects variability in vesicle release probability. However, a new study suggests that the number of vesicles released is actually regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool (RRP), which is controlled by protein kinase A (PKA) and its target, synapsin.

The study used mouse brain slices to demonstrate that the number of vesicles released is determined by the size of the RRP, rather than release probability. The researchers found that PKA and synapsin dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released, without altering release probability. This means that the number of vesicles released is not solely determined by the likelihood of release, but also by the number of vesicles available for release.

The RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, which is under the control of synapsins. The size of the RRP constrains the number of vesicles released, and is a key factor in determining whether an active zone supports univesicular release (UVR) or multivesicular release (MVR). The study's findings suggest that the RRP is a fundamental synaptic parameter that has not been fully explored, and that it plays a critical role in regulating synaptic transmission.

The study's results have implications for our understanding of synaptic diversity and the development of unifying models of presynaptic function. The findings suggest that the number of vesicles released is not solely determined by release probability, but also by the number of vesicles available for release. This challenges the prevailing view that release probability is the principal regulator of UVR and MVR, and highlights the importance of the RRP in regulating synaptic transmission. The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control MVR and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.
Summary
     Scientists have long been puzzled by how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) selectively packages its genetic material, known as RNA, into new virus particles. A key protein called Gag plays a crucial role in this process, but the exact mechanism has remained unclear. In a recent study, researchers used a simplified system to investigate how Gag selects and packages HIV-1 RNA.

     The study found that Gag assembles on the surface of tiny vesicles, called giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), and selectively packages a specific region of the HIV-1 genome, known as the 5' untranslated region (5' UTR). This selective packaging occurs even when there is a large excess of other RNAs present in the cell. The researchers also discovered that mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag, which affects its ability to self-assemble on the membrane, abolish the selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA.

     The study suggests that the ability of Gag to selectively package HIV-1 RNA and its self-assembly on membranes are interdependent processes. The researchers propose a model in which a viral RNA with multiple high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane, allowing for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genome. This model is supported by the finding that the NC domain of Gag is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA.

     The study also highlights the importance of membrane-localized Gag assembly events in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging. The researchers found that the large majority of plasma membrane-proximal genomic HIV-1 RNAs are monomeric in the absence of HIV-1 Gag, but coalesce to dimers on the membrane in the presence of Gag. This suggests that the assembly of Gag on the membrane is a critical step in the selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanism of HIV-1 genome packaging and highlights the importance of Gag self-assembly on membranes in this process. The findings have implications for the development of new treatments and therapies for HIV-1 infection.
