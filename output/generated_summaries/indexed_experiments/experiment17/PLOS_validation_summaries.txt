Researchers studied how genetic variations affect gene expression in human cells. They focused on the role of RNA 3'-end processing, a process that determines the length of messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules. The team analyzed data from lymphoblastoid cells, which are a type of immune cell, from individuals with different genetic backgrounds. They found that the positions of mRNA ends did not occur randomly in non-coding regions of the genome, but instead often coincided with regulatory elements, such as microRNA (miRNA) sites. The researchers also discovered that variations in polyadenylation signals and other 3'-motifs were associated with differences in gene expression levels. They confirmed these findings through experiments on individual genes and showed that natural variations in RNA 3'-end processing can affect the response of immune cells to antigen stimulation. The study highlights the importance of two mechanisms: the use of distinct 3'-end processing signals and the effects of 3'-sequence elements on transcript fate. The researchers suggest that integrating information on 3'-end positions and regulatory motifs can be a powerful tool for understanding the impact of genetic variations on gene expression. Their findings have implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits and diseases, and highlight the need for further research into the role of RNA 3'-end processing in regulating gene expression.
Researchers have studied the effectiveness of a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) vaccine, SIVΔnef, in protecting against wild-type lentiviral challenge. This vaccine has been shown to be one of the most effective in inducing protection, but the mechanisms behind its success were not well understood. To investigate, the researchers used advanced sequencing technology to analyze the CD8 T cell response in vaccinated animals. CD8 T cells are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off viral infections.

The study found that the initial CD8 T cell response in the early stages of SIVΔnef infection targeted more variable parts of the virus. However, as the virus evolved and mutated, the CD8 T cell response shifted to target more conserved, or stable, parts of the virus. This shift was accompanied by the emergence of new CD8 T cell responses against the mutated virus. The researchers also found that the CD8 T cell response became more diverse and complex over time, with more CD8 T cells targeting different parts of the virus.

The study's findings suggest that the success of the SIVΔnef vaccine is due to its ability to induce a CD8 T cell response that targets both variable and conserved parts of the virus. This is known as anentropic specificity. The researchers also found that the vaccine-induced CD8 T cell response became deeper and more complex over time, with more CD8 T cells targeting different parts of the virus. These findings highlight the importance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the body's defense against fungal infections in the mouth. Specifically, they found that IL-1 helps coordinate the response of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, to Candida albicans, a common fungus that can cause infections in the oral mucosa. In a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis, the researchers showed that IL-1 signaling is essential for recruiting neutrophils to the site of infection and for mobilizing new neutrophils from the bone marrow. Without IL-1 signaling, mice were unable to control the fungus and had an increased fungal load in the tongue. The researchers also found that endothelial cells, which line the blood vessels, produce a protein called granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in response to IL-1, which in turn helps to mobilize neutrophils. This IL-1-dependent crosstalk between different cell types is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination in the oral mucosa. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of antifungal immunity and highlights the importance of IL-1 in coordinating the neutrophil response to fungal infections. Overall, the findings suggest that IL-1 plays a key role in protecting the host from disease by regulating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals in 48 endemic countries through annual mass drug administration (MDA) of anti-filarial drugs. This significant achievement resulted in an estimated $21.8 billion in economic benefits over the lifetime of 31.4 million individuals treated during the first 8 years of the program. The economic benefits were calculated by quantifying the number of clinical manifestations averted and analyzing the savings associated with disease prevention, including direct treatment costs, indirect costs of lost labor, and costs to the health system.

The study found that the protection of nearly 3 million newborns and other individuals from acquiring lymphatic filariasis resulted in over $2.3 billion in economic benefits. Additionally, more than 28 million individuals already infected with LF benefited from the program's efforts to halt the progression of their disease, resulting in an associated lifetime economic benefit of approximately $19.5 billion. Furthermore, decreased patient services associated with reduced LF morbidity saved the health systems of endemic countries approximately $2.2 billion. The study concludes that MDA for LF offers significant economic benefits, and with favorable program implementation costs, the economic rate of return of the GPELF is extremely high, making it an excellent investment in global health.
Researchers have developed a new animal model to study a rare genetic disorder called Gaucher disease, which is linked to an increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in the GBA gene, which leads to a deficiency in an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (GCase). This deficiency causes the accumulation of toxic substances in cells, leading to cell damage and death. To study the effects of GCase deficiency, scientists created a new model using medaka fish, a type of fish that can survive for months without GCase activity. The medaka fish with the GBA mutation (GBA-/-) developed symptoms similar to those seen in humans with Gaucher disease, including the accumulation of abnormal cells in the brain and progressive neuronal loss.

The researchers found that the GBA-/- medaka also accumulated alpha-synuclein (α-syn), a protein associated with Parkinson's disease, in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. However, disrupting α-syn did not improve the life span or reduce the formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in the GBA-/- medaka. This suggests that α-syn may not be a major contributor to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. The study provides new insights into the pathological mechanisms of Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease, and highlights the potential importance of axonal transport of α-syn in the development of Parkinson's disease. The findings may also have implications for the development of new therapies for Gaucher disease and Parkinson's disease.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to a type of bacteria called Listeria monocytogenes, which can live inside host cells. They found that when L. monocytogenes is contained within a phagosome, a type of cellular compartment, it suppresses the immune system's ability to mount a strong response against it. This suppression is not just due to inefficient antigen presentation, but is a direct result of the bacteria's presence within the phagosome. The researchers also discovered that the presence of L. monocytogenes within a phagosome can prevent the immune system from generating long-term immunity against the bacteria, even if it escapes into the host cell's cytosol. This is because the phagosome-confined bacteria produce a protein called IL-10, which suppresses the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and limits the expansion of immune cells called T cells. By blocking the IL-10 receptor or removing the protein MyD88, which is necessary for IL-10 production, the researchers were able to restore the immune system's ability to mount a strong response against L. monocytogenes. These findings suggest that the location of a pathogen within a host cell can significantly impact the immune system's response to it, and highlight the importance of understanding how microbes interact with the immune system to control their pathogenic effects.
Researchers have identified genetic variants in the SIX6 gene associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The study sequenced the SIX6 gene in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls and found six nonsynonymous coding variants, including one common variant, Asn141His (rs33912345), which was significantly associated with POAG. The variants were tested in a zebrafish model to evaluate their effects on eye development, and five of the variants were found to be hypomorphic or null, while one variant in the SIX6 enhancer increased expression of SIX6 and disrupted its regulation. The study also found that patients who are homozygous for the SIX6 risk allele (His141) have a thinner retinal nerve fiber layer than those who are homozygous for the non-risk allele (Asn141). This suggests that SIX6 risk variants may disrupt the development of the neural retina, leading to a reduced number of retinal ganglion cells and an increased risk of glaucoma-associated vision loss. The findings provide new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying POAG and may lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for the disease.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch that controls the production of flagella and toxins in the human intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile. This switch, called the flagellar switch, is a 154-base pair sequence that determines whether the bacteria produce flagella and toxins. When the switch is in one orientation, the bacteria produce flagella and toxins, while in the other orientation, they do not. This phase variation affects the bacteria's ability to adhere to intestinal epithelial cells and cause disease.

The flagellar switch is located upstream of the flgB operon, which contains genes necessary for flagellum biosynthesis. When the switch is in the "ON" orientation, the bacteria express flagellum and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete toxins. In contrast, when the switch is in the "OFF" orientation, the bacteria are attenuated for flagellar and toxin gene expression, are aflagellate, and show decreased toxin secretion.

The researchers found that the orientation of the flagellar switch is reversible during growth in vitro and that a C. difficile-specific regulatory factor is required to destabilize or degrade early flagellar gene mRNA when the switch is in the OFF orientation. They also identified the tyrosine recombinase RecV as the enzyme responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions.

The flagellar switch affects toxin production by impacting the production of glucosylating toxins and the cytotoxicity of C. difficile. The researchers demonstrated that the flagellar switch controls toxin production in addition to flagellum biosynthesis and swimming motility, indicating that these major virulence factors are coordinately phase variable in C. difficile.
Researchers studied the process of spore formation in Clostridium difficile, a bacterium that causes intestinal infections. This process, called endosporulation, results in the formation of highly resistant spores that are central to the bacterium's infectious cycle. The study focused on the sigma factors, proteins that regulate gene expression during spore formation. In the model organism Bacillus subtilis, four sigma factors (σF, σE, σG, and σK) are known to control gene expression at different stages of spore formation. The researchers found that these sigma factors are also present in Clostridium difficile, but their activity and regulation differ from those in Bacillus subtilis. Specifically, the activity of σE is partially independent of σF, and σG and σK do not follow the same sequence of activation as in Bacillus subtilis. The study also found that σK is not strictly required for the formation of heat-resistant spores. The results suggest that the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved across species, but the details of the process have evolved differently in different bacteria. This study provides new insights into the complex process of spore formation in Clostridium difficile and highlights the differences between this bacterium and the model organism Bacillus subtilis. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of endosporulation and the development of new treatments for Clostridium difficile infections.
Researchers have developed a new framework to model the behavior of proteins that are activated by multiple sites, known as allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins. This framework uses a single auxiliary variable to replicate the steady-state behavior of more complex systems, making it easier to analyze and understand the dynamics of these proteins. The model shows that optimal sensitivity is achieved when the activation of the protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant. This reduction makes the framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications, where multiple multisite proteins interact simultaneously.

The researchers applied this framework to a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast, which measures cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth. They found that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to bud growth or size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or-none response triggered when the signal reaches a threshold. The framework can also be extended to other types of multisite modifications, such as ligand binding, transcription factor regulation, and methylation or acetylation.

The model assumes that the protein substrate is phosphorylated by a kinase at possible sites and dephosphorylated by a phosphatase, and that the system is nonsequential, with different phosphoforms of the protein. The number of sites is thought to be relatively large, such as four or more. The framework provides a simple and compact way to describe the dynamics of allosteric multisite phosphorylation systems, making it a useful tool for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems.
Researchers have made a breakthrough in understanding how bacteria communicate with each other through a process called quorum sensing. Quorum sensing allows bacteria to coordinate their behavior and make decisions as a group, giving them a selective advantage. However, the underlying mechanisms of this process have remained unclear. A team of scientists used a combination of experiments and mathematical models to study the quorum sensing system in E. coli bacteria. They focused on the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) system, which is a key component of quorum sensing. By breaking down the system into smaller parts and studying each component separately, the researchers were able to identify a new negative feedback interaction that plays a crucial role in the system. They also discovered that the LsrR regulator is a key player in the E. coli quorum sensing "switch," which allows the bacteria to switch between different behaviors. The researchers used a simple mathematical model to understand how the different components of the system interact with each other and contribute to the overall functioning of the network. This "bottom-up" approach allowed them to gain a deeper understanding of the complex interactions within the quorum sensing system. The findings of this study have the potential to shed light on other regulatory pathways within bacterial cells and could be used to guide the development of new biotechnological applications.
Researchers conducted a study in rural Gabon to investigate the impact of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) on Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children. The study found that schistosomiasis tends to increase the risk of P. falciparum infection, but when combined with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection, the risk is significantly higher. The incidence of malaria over time was higher in children infected with Schistosoma haematobium compared to those who were not infected. The study also found that STH enhance the risk of P. falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children, and that schistosomiasis increases susceptibility to developing malaria in young children, but not in older children. The study suggests that STH and schistosomiasis control should be considered as an additional tool for malaria control in areas where the two diseases are co-endemic. The study's longitudinal design allowed for a more precise examination of the interactions between schistosomiasis and malaria, which is a limitation of previous cross-sectional studies. The findings have implications for the design of malaria control programs in areas where schistosomiasis and P. falciparum are prevalent.
Researchers investigated the role of inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania donovani infection. They found that the inflammatory response, induced by the transcription factor IRF-5, limits CD8+ T cell expansion and induces HIF-1α in dendritic cells. HIF-1α is a protein that helps cells adapt to low oxygen levels, but in this case, its induction in dendritic cells impairs their ability to stimulate CD8+ T cell responses. The study showed that mice lacking HIF-1α in dendritic cells had a higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8+ T cells, enhanced CD8+ T cell expansion, and reduced parasite burden. This suggests that HIF-1α induction in dendritic cells is an immune-evasive mechanism adopted by Leishmania parasites to establish persistent infections. The researchers also found that IRF-5 is essential for the development of protective CD8+ T cell responses, and that CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in controlling parasite growth. Overall, the study highlights the complex relationship between inflammation, HIF-1α, and CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmania infection, and provides new insights into the mechanisms used by Leishmania parasites to evade the host immune system.
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis to identify risk factors for adverse prognosis and death in patients with American visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a serious public health problem in Latin America. They analyzed 14 studies from Brazil and found that several factors were associated with a higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. These factors included jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 and over 40-50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also linked to poor outcomes.

The study found that Leishmania-HIV coinfection was a significant prognostic factor, with coinfected individuals having a higher risk of poor prognosis. However, undernutrition was not found to be a risk factor for severity or mortality. The researchers suggest that undernutrition may be a consequence of the wasting syndrome in VL rather than a risk factor.

The study highlights the need for better management of patients at higher risk of an unfavorable evolution of the disease. The lack of reduction in fatality rates of VL in Brazil is attributed to limitations in therapy, delay in diagnosis, and inadequate management of high-risk patients. The identification of prognostic factors can be a valuable tool for clinical practice, and the development of externally validated prognostic models is recommended for future research.
Researchers in Algeria investigated the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites to antimony, a common treatment for leishmaniasis, over a 30-year period. They collected 106 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phlebotomines in 14 localities where the disease is endemic, as well as 18 isolates from dogs in France. The researchers tested the isolates' sensitivity to two forms of antimony: potassium antimony tartrate (Sb(III)) and sodium stibogluconate (Sb(V)). They found a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) isolates over the 30-year period, but an increase in the frequency of resistant phenotypes in cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) isolates. The emergence of resistant phenotypes was linked to the inclusion of Leishmania killicki (syn: L. tropica) isolates, which cause cutaneous leishmaniasis and have emerged in Algeria in recent years. The study highlights the need for regular monitoring of antimony susceptibility in Leishmania isolates to prevent the spread of drug-resistant strains. The researchers established an epidemiological cutoff value (ECOFF) to differentiate between susceptible and resistant parasites, which can help classify Leishmania isolates according to their antimony-susceptibility status. This study provides valuable insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility in Algeria and emphasizes the importance of preserving the therapeutic efficiency of antimonials to cure leishmaniasis.
Researchers investigated the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition. They found that exposure to certain foodborne pathogens, such as Salmonella Typhimurium and Citrobacter rodentium, can increase the risk of CD in individuals colonized with a specific type of bacteria called adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC). AIEC is a pathobiont, a type of bacteria that normally resides in the gut but can contribute to disease when the gut is inflamed.

The study used two new models to mimic the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis and CD in mice. The results showed that mice colonized with AIEC and infected with Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodentium had a worse outcome compared to mice that were not colonized with AIEC. The researchers found that AIEC levels increased in the gut tissue after acute infectious gastroenteritis, leading to an increase in inflammation, barrier defects, and delays in mucosal restitution.

The study suggests that individuals colonized with AIEC at the time of acute infectious gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for developing CD. The researchers also identified AIEC as a potential target for therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying the link between acute infectious gastroenteritis and CD, and highlight the importance of AIEC in the development of CD.
Researchers have discovered a key regulator of cell fate in the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis, a flowering plant. The female gametophyte contains two gametic cells, the egg cell and the central cell, and five accessory cells, all of which are essential for fertilization. However, the mechanisms that determine which cells become gametic and which become accessory are not well understood. A mutant called lachesis (lis) was identified, which forms extra egg cells and causes accessory cells to adopt gametic cell fate. This suggests that the lachesis protein is involved in a mechanism that prevents accessory cells from becoming gametic cells. The lachesis protein is similar to a splicing factor found in yeast, indicating that components of the splice apparatus play a role in cell fate decisions. The study found that all cells in the female gametophyte are capable of becoming gametic cells, but the lachesis protein represses this fate in accessory cells. In addition, the lachesis protein also suppresses egg cell fate in the central cell. The research reveals two levels of cell fate regulation in the female gametophyte: one between gametic and accessory cells, and one between egg and central cells. The study provides new insights into the complex process of gamete formation in flowering plants.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in a rural highland Ethiopian community to understand the barriers to wearing shoes, which is crucial for preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). The study used the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, educational, and ecological factors influencing shoe use among children. The researchers gathered information from 242 respondents through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and extended case studies.

The study found that shoe-wearing norms are changing in the community, with going barefoot becoming increasingly seen as "shameful." However, many practical and social barriers prevent people from wearing shoes regularly. Limited financial resources make it difficult for people to purchase and maintain shoes, leading to shoes being reserved for special occasions. As a result, children often do not wear shoes until they reach a certain age.

The study identified several barriers to shoe wearing, including financial constraints, poor suitability of shoes for daily activities, and low risk perception. These barriers are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs, not just podoconiosis. The researchers suggest that targeting individuals' beliefs and attitudes about shoe wearing could be an effective way to improve shoe use and prevent NTDs. The study's findings have implications for those implementing footwear programs and highlight the need to address underlying structural barriers related to poverty.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which the pseudorabies virus (PRV) targets its structural proteins to axons of infected neurons. The PRV Us9 protein plays a crucial role in this process, and its absence leads to defective anterograde transmission of the virus in vivo. To understand how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of viral proteins, scientists studied its association with lipid rafts, which are microdomains on the surface of infected cells. They found that Us9 is indeed associated with lipid rafts and that this association is essential for Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins.

In experiments using PC12 cells, a rat cell line that mimics sympathetic neurons, researchers showed that Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes, which are characteristic of lipid rafts. Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited the anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. These findings suggest that the association of Us9 with lipid rafts is critical for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and for the directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus transmission and highlights the importance of lipid rafts in this process.
Researchers have found that genetically identical cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit variation in growth rate and stress tolerance, a phenomenon known as nongenetic heterogeneity. This variation has important implications for understanding how cells within tumors and microbial infections respond to treatment. The study used genetic and chemical perturbations, combined with high-throughput single-cell assays, to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying this heterogeneity. The researchers found that differences in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, acting through the Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its target transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4, underlie this nongenetic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, and an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. The study also found that the paralogs Msn2 and Msn4 differ in their roles in nongenetic heterogeneity, with Msn2 required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl1, a subunit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or by culturing wild-type cells with the cell-permeable cAMP analog 8-bromo-cAMP or the PKA inhibitor H89 significantly impacts survival of acute heat stress. The results suggest that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, acting through Msn2 and Msn4, underlies nongenetic heterogeneity in yeast-cell growth and stress tolerance, and provide a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) during an outbreak in the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique in 2013-2014. They used advanced sequencing technologies to analyze the virus from infected individuals and found a range of genetic variations, including some that were not previously known. These variations were present at different levels in the population, suggesting that the virus was evolving rapidly. The researchers also found a new structure in the virus's genetic code, known as a 3' untranslated region (UTR), which was not previously seen in nature and allowed the virus to replicate more efficiently in insect cells. This new UTR structure may have contributed to the virus's ability to spread quickly in the Caribbean. The study's findings highlight the importance of continued surveillance of viral diversity over time to understand the evolutionary potential of CHIKV. The researchers constructed an infectious clone of the virus, which will be useful for future studies on the virus's pathogenesis, adaptation, and evolution in the Americas. The study's results are consistent with previous research on the Asian lineage of CHIKV and provide new insights into the genetic diversity of the virus during an ongoing epidemic.
Researchers have identified a previously unannotated gene called UBTOR, which plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and the mTOR signaling pathway. The mTOR pathway is involved in various human diseases, including cancer. The study found that reducing UBTOR function in cultured neurons and cancer cells promotes cell growth and neurite outgrowth, while overexpressing UBTOR suppresses colony formation in cancer cells. This suggests that UBTOR acts as a brake on cell growth and tumor formation.

Mechanistic studies revealed that UBTOR stabilizes a component of the mTOR complex called DEPTOR, which inhibits the mTOR signaling pathway. In zebrafish models, disrupting the UBTOR gene led to increased mTOR activity and worsened tumor formation caused by a mutated version of the HRAS gene. Similarly, depleting UBTOR in mice promoted tumor growth and increased mTOR signaling in a xenograft model. These findings demonstrate that UBTOR regulates cell growth and neoplasia through the mTOR signaling pathway.

Interestingly, the study also found that nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment upregulates UBTOR expression, suggesting that UBTOR may play a role in regulating mTOR signaling in response to external signals. The discovery of UBTOR's role in regulating cell growth and tumor formation highlights its potential as a target for cancer therapy. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms by which UBTOR regulates the mTOR pathway and its implications for human disease.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of protein complexes in the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness. This parasite is highly diverged from well-studied eukaryotes, making it difficult to understand its biology and pathogenesis. To address this, the researchers used biochemical fractionation to systematically study the interactions of over 3,300 protein groups in the procyclic life stage of T. brucei. They identified 128 high-confidence complexes, including 635 previously uncharacterized proteins, and validated the functions of several novel proteins associated with the RNA-editing machinery.

The study provides an unprecedented view of the protein complex map of T. brucei and serves as a reliable resource for further characterization of trypanosomatid proteins. The researchers used this map to reveal novel factors involved in the mitochondrial post-transcriptional regulation of T. brucei and validated their findings through independent experiments. The study also highlights the utility of protein interaction maps in functional annotation of proteins, which is particularly important for trypanosomatid parasites where homology-based approaches are not applicable.

The researchers found that certain complexes, such as the cytoplasmic ribosomal complex and proteasome, are essential in all life stages of the parasite, while others, like the complex highly enriched for intraflagellar proteins, are not essential in the procyclic life stage. This study provides a valuable resource for formulating new biological hypotheses and further experimental leads in understanding the biology and pathogenesis of T. brucei.
Researchers studied how the bacteria that cause tuberculosis (TB) infect lymph nodes in macaques, which are often used as models for human disease. They found that lymph nodes are not just sites where the immune system fights TB, but also where the bacteria can persist for a long time. In fact, the bacteria can grow to the same level in lymph nodes of both cynomolgus and rhesus macaques, but cynomolgus macaques are better at controlling the infection. Rhesus macaques, on the other hand, are more susceptible to TB and have more extensive damage to their lymph nodes.

The researchers used a type of imaging called PET CT scans to track inflammation in the lymph nodes of infected macaques. They found that the lymph nodes became more active early in the infection, and at the time of death, almost all of the active lymph nodes contained live TB bacteria. The researchers also found that the lymph nodes in rhesus macaques were more damaged than those in cynomolgus macaques, which made it harder for the immune system to fight the infection.

The study suggests that lymph nodes are not just passive bystanders in TB infection, but play an active role in allowing the bacteria to persist. The researchers also found that the lymph nodes are not very good at killing the bacteria, even with treatment. Overall, the study provides new insights into how TB infects and persists in lymph nodes, which could help in the development of new treatments for the disease.
Researchers have identified a large collection of novel microsporidia, a type of fungus-related intracellular pathogen, that infect nematodes, a group of worm-like animals. These microsporidia were isolated from wild nematodes, including the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. The study found that Nematocida parisii is the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. Six new species in the Nematocida genus were also identified, as well as two new subclades, Enteropsectra and Pancytospora, which are genetically distinct from Nematocida and belong to the main clade of microsporidia that includes human pathogens. The microsporidia were found to infect intestinal cells, except for Pancytospora epiphaga, which replicates in the epidermis of its host. The study also showed that some microsporidia have broad host specificity, while others have narrow host specificity. For example, some microsporidia can infect Oscheius tipulae but not its sister species Oscheius sp. 3. The researchers also found that Nematocida ausubeli fails to strongly induce the transcription of genes in C. elegans that are induced by other Nematocida species. This suggests that N. ausubeli has evolved mechanisms to prevent the induction of this host response. The study provides a rich resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nematode hosts and highlights the diversity and ubiquity of microsporidian infections in nematodes.
Chemokine receptors, a type of G protein-coupled receptor, play a crucial role in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis and HIV infection. These receptors can form dimers, or pairs, with themselves (homo-dimers) or with other receptors (heterodimers), which can modulate their function. However, the detailed structure of these dimers and how they interact with cholesterol in the cell membrane is not well understood.

Researchers used computer simulations to study the dimerization patterns of three chemokine receptors: CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2. They found that the closely related CC chemokine receptors, CCR5 and CCR2, share similar dimerization patterns, but differ from those of CXCR4. Cholesterol, a key component of the cell membrane, also affects the dimerization of these receptors, but in a subtype-specific manner.

The study revealed distinct dimerization patterns for heterodimers formed by CXCR4 and CCR5, and CXCR4 and CCR2. Notably, the association between CXCR4 and CCR5 is more sensitive to cholesterol than the association between CXCR4 and CCR2. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and highlights how heterodimerization and cholesterol interaction can diversify the function of closely related G protein-coupled receptors. The findings have implications for understanding the role of chemokine receptors in various diseases, including cancer and HIV infection.
Researchers have identified a new form of systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by a parasite that affects the immune system. This new form, referred to as "atypical" systemic leishmaniasis, presents with symptoms that are different from the classical form of the disease. While the classical form is characterized by prolonged fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting, the atypical form presents with symptoms such as lymphadenopathy, anemia, and depressed immunity. In a study of 160 patients with suspected immune deficiency, 19.4% were found to have normal laboratory profiles but exhibited dysfunctional macrophages laden with Leishmania parasites. This suggests that systemic leishmaniasis may be more common than previously thought and can present with a wider range of symptoms than previously suspected. The study also found that the disease is not limited to the pediatric age group, as adults were also affected. The researchers recommend that atypical systemic leishmaniasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with unexplained depressed immunity and no obvious immunologic defect. The study highlights the need for further research into the clinical presentation and diagnosis of systemic leishmaniasis.
Researchers analyzed millions of mutations and polymorphisms in human populations to identify potential predictors of disease, drug reactions, and age-related conditions. However, predicting the consequences of a sequence variant is a complex task. A new study explored the potential of variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins as a means of identifying polymorphisms with likely phenotypic consequences. The researchers assembled a collection of known disease-causing variants and identified pairs of sequence variants that occur at homologous positions within paralogous human proteins. They found that the locations of variants are correlated in paralogous proteins, and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. This information can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide candidates for further diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The study also found that sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino acid pairs more frequently than expected by chance, suggesting that similar functional constraints on paralogous protein sequences result in coordinated distributions of both disease and non-disease-causing variants along their lengths. This approach can be used to identify new disease gene candidates and uncharacterized variants within them likely to have phenotypic consequences.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria. They used a technique called RNA sequencing to analyze the parasite's gene expression in 44 patient isolates. The results showed that parasites causing severe malaria had altered gene expression compared to those causing uncomplicated malaria. Specifically, they found that severe malaria parasites had decreased glycolysis, altered chromatin structure, and reduced expression of surface antigens called PfEMP1. PfEMP1s are major targets of protective immunity, and their reduced expression may explain why patients with severe malaria have lower levels of antibodies to these antigens.

The study also identified novel associations between disease severity and PfEMP1 transcripts, domains, and smaller sequence segments. These findings suggest that parasites adapt to the host environment in severe malaria by down-regulating genes involved in PfEMP1 surface expression. This is in contrast to previous studies that found increased expression of these genes in severe malaria. The study's results will inform efforts to identify vaccine targets for severe malaria and provide insights into how parasites adapt to the host environment in severe malaria. Overall, the study sheds light on the genetic changes that occur in Plasmodium falciparum during severe malaria and highlights the importance of understanding these changes for developing effective treatments and vaccines.
Scientists have been exploring a promising approach to prevent HIV-1 infection by delivering potent, broadly-neutralizing antibodies directly into the body. In a recent study, researchers used a virus-like particle called an adeno-associated virus (AAV) to deliver a specific antibody, called 5L7 IgG1, to rhesus monkeys. The goal was to see if this approach could provide long-term protection against the SIVmac239 virus, a close relative of HIV-1.

The study found that the delivered antibody provided significant protective effects against the SIVmac239 challenge, even in the absence of neutralizing activity. The monkeys that received the AAV-delivered antibody showed lower viral loads at peak and set point, and a delay in the time to peak viral load after exposure to the virus. One monkey even resisted six successive challenges with the SIVmac239 virus, including a final challenge with a high dose of the virus.

However, the study also found that the monkeys developed an immune response to the delivered antibody, which limited the concentration of the antibody that could be achieved. This is a potential problem for this approach, as it could reduce the effectiveness of the treatment over time.

Despite this challenge, the study demonstrates the continued promise of using AAV-delivered antibodies to prevent HIV-1 infection. This approach has the potential to provide long-term protection against the virus, and could be used in combination with other treatments to provide a sterilizing barrier to infection. Further research is needed to overcome the problem of anti-antibody responses and make this approach a reality.
Scientists have long assumed that proteins respond linearly to changes in their environment, such as the binding or detachment of molecules. However, a new study suggests that this assumption may not always hold true. Researchers investigated the conformational motions of two motor proteins, myosin V and kinesin KIF1A, using a simplified model called the elastic network model. They found that these proteins do not respond linearly to changes in their environment, a phenomenon known as nonlinearity. This nonlinearity is particularly pronounced in kinesin KIF1A, where the traditional method of analyzing protein motion, called normal mode analysis, completely fails to describe the protein's behavior. Despite this nonlinearity, the researchers found that the proteins still exhibit well-defined and robust conformational relaxation paths, which are essential for their function. These findings challenge the traditional understanding of protein dynamics and suggest that important assumptions in the field may need to be revised. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how proteins work and how they respond to changes in their environment. The researchers' findings also highlight the importance of considering nonlinearity in protein dynamics, which could lead to a more accurate understanding of protein function and behavior.
Researchers have discovered that caveolins and cavins, components of caveolae, play a crucial role in regulating clathrin-independent endocytosis. Clathrin-independent endocytosis is a process by which cells take in substances from outside the cell without using clathrin, a protein that helps form vesicles. The study found that specific caveolar proteins, such as Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, act as negative regulators of this process. They inhibit the clathrin-independent carriers/GPI-AP enriched early endosomal compartment (CLIC/GEEC) pathway, which is a type of clathrin-independent endocytosis. This inhibition occurs independently of caveola formation, suggesting that caveolins and cavins can regulate endocytosis even when they are not part of caveolae.

The study also found that caveolins and cavins can be endocytosed through the CLIC/GEEC pathway, and that this pathway is upregulated in cells lacking CAV1/Cavin-1 or with reduced expression of Cavin-1 and Cavin-3. The researchers used various techniques, including quantitative electron microscopy analysis and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies, to investigate the role of caveolins and cavins in regulating clathrin-independent endocytosis.

The study provides new insights into the regulation of clathrin-independent endocytosis and highlights the complex interactions between different endocytic pathways. The findings suggest that caveolins and cavins play a crucial role in regulating membrane dynamics and endocytic polarization in migrating cells and adult muscle tissue. The study also identifies noncaveolar Cavin-1 as a modulator of the key regulator of the CLIC/GEEC pathway, Cdc42.
Researchers have identified a new subclass of two-component signaling systems in bacteria, Archaea, and plants, known as Aspartate-Less Receiver (ALR) domains. These domains are found in approximately 4% of all Receiver (REC) domains and are characterized by the absence of a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue, which is typically phosphorylated by a sensory histidine kinase to initiate a signaling response. The study found that ALRs are surprisingly common and are often associated with rare effector outputs. Analysis of ALR structures and biochemical data suggests that these domains have reorganized their active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate input signals other than Asp phosphorylation, while retaining the canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimeric interface.

The study also found that some ALRs have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs from small molecules, such as antibiotics, and Ser-Thr phosphorylation through bacterial eukaryotic-like Ser-Thr kinases and their cognate PP2C phosphatases, which regulate crucial cell envelope-related functions and virulence in many microbes. The researchers identified 74,816 unique REC-containing proteins, 2,976 of which were missing or had substitutions at the conserved Asp position, and renamed this subset of REC-type sequences Aspartate-Less Receivers (ALRs). The study provides insights into shared mechanisms of activation between ALR and REC domains and defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass.
Researchers have developed a new type of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) that targets cancer cells by retargeting to a specific receptor called HER2, which is overexpressed in many types of cancer. Unlike previous oHSVs, this new virus is fully virulent and can replicate in cancer cells while sparing healthy cells. The virus was tested in mice with HER2-expressing tumors and was found to be safe and effective in inhibiting tumor growth. When armed with an immune-boosting protein called IL-12, the virus showed even greater efficacy and was able to induce an immune response that not only targeted the primary tumor but also prevented the growth of untreated tumors in the opposite side of the body. This is known as an "abscopal" effect, where the immune system is activated to attack cancer cells throughout the body. The study found that the virus was able to break down the immune suppressive environment around the tumor, allowing the immune system to attack the cancer cells more effectively. The results suggest that this new type of oHSV has the potential to be a powerful tool in cancer treatment, offering a safe and effective way to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells.
A recent study investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. Researchers compared the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by adenovirus 5 (Ad5) and canarypox viral vector (ALVAC) to HIV. The study found that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells were readily susceptible to HIV, while ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower susceptibility of ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells was associated with reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on these cells. Additionally, ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL4 (MIP-β) but little IL-17. The study also found that ALVAC and Ad5 vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs. CD4 T-cell proliferative responses in PBMC, with ALVAC preferentially inducing CD8 T-cell proliferation, while Ad5 vector induced CD4 T-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALVAC-induced CD8 T cells led to a modest increase in HIV infection of vector-specific CD4 T cells, suggesting a role of ALVAC-specific CD8 T cells in protecting ALVAC-specific CD4 T cells from HIV. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination and suggest that the choice of vaccine vector may impact the susceptibility of CD4 T cells to HIV infection.
Researchers investigated the evolution of X inactivation strategies in female mammals, where one X chromosome is silenced in each somatic cell. They found that the choice of which X chromosome to silence varies among species, ranging from strict paternally inherited X inactivation (PXI) to unbiased random X inactivation (RXI). PXI renders females haploid for all maternally inherited alleles, while RXI equalizes expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each female tissue.

The study used a theoretical population genetic analysis to examine how conditions such as dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence the evolution of X inactivation strategies. The results showed that a single interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential selection can select for a range of X inactivation strategies, including unequal rates of inactivation between maternally and paternally inherited X chromosomes.

The study found that RXI is favored over PXI as long as alleles deleterious to female fitness are sufficiently recessive. However, the criteria for RXI evolution are more restrictive when fitness variation is sexually antagonistic, meaning that alleles deleterious to females are beneficial to males. Evolutionary transitions from PXI to RXI generally increase mean relative female fitness at the expense of decreased male fitness. The study provides a theoretical framework for predicting and interpreting the evolution of chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes and makes several predictions that could motivate future studies of allele-specific gene expression variation.
Researchers have identified a protein called zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) that can block the infection of a specific type of virus called Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). ZAP is a host factor that has been shown to restrict the infection of many viruses by degrading viral RNA, inhibiting translation, and triggering the innate immune response. In this study, scientists investigated the antiviral potential of human ZAP against three flaviviruses: JEV, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). They found that overexpressing ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIKV, and that depleting ZAP enhanced JEV replication. The study also showed that ZAP targeted JEV translation and degraded viral RNA through a process called 3'-5' RNA exosome-mediated degradation. The researchers found that the zinc-finger motifs of ZAP were essential for its antiviral activity against JEV. They also identified a specific region of the JEV genome that binds to ZAP, making the virus sensitive to ZAP's antiviral effects. This study provides new insights into the antiviral mechanism of ZAP and suggests that it may act as an intrinsic antiviral factor to fight against JEV infection.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic virus that causes outbreaks in livestock and can lead to severe disease in humans. Researchers studied the response of mice to RVFV infection to better understand how the virus causes disease. They compared the response of mice infected with a wild-type strain of the virus (ZH501) to those infected with a live-attenuated vaccine strain (MP-12). The study found that mice infected with the wild-type strain developed severe disease, including liver damage and inflammation, and a strong immune response. In contrast, mice infected with the vaccine strain showed little to no disease symptoms and a minimal immune response. The researchers also found that the wild-type strain caused a significant increase in cytokines and chemokines in the liver and brain, indicating a strong inflammatory response. However, despite this response, there was little to no tissue damage in the brain. The study suggests that the pathogenesis of RVFV in mice is associated with liver damage and inflammation, but the long-term effects of the disease may be neurological in nature. The findings have implications for understanding how RVFV causes disease in humans and could inform the development of more effective treatments and vaccines.
Researchers have found that a protein called C-C motif chemokine ligand 20 (CCL20) plays a significant role in the development of resistance to chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a type of breast cancer that is difficult to treat and has a poor prognosis. Chemotherapy is often used to treat TNBC, but some patients develop resistance to the treatment, making it less effective. The study found that CCL20 is elevated in patients with TNBC who do not respond to chemotherapy.

The researchers discovered that CCL20 promotes the growth and survival of cancer stem cells, which are cells that are thought to be responsible for the development and spread of cancer. CCL20 also increases the expression of a protein called ABCB1, which helps cancer cells to pump out chemotherapy drugs, making them less effective. This creates a positive feedback loop, where CCL20 promotes the growth of cancer stem cells, which in turn produce more CCL20, making the cancer more resistant to treatment.

The study suggests that CCL20 could be used as a marker to predict which patients are likely to respond to chemotherapy, and that blocking CCL20 or its downstream pathways could help to reverse resistance to treatment. The researchers also found that combining chemotherapy with a drug that blocks ABCB1 could improve the effectiveness of treatment. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance in TNBC and identifies potential new targets for treatment.
Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, can infect virtually any nucleated cell in warm-blooded animals. The parasite's ability to infect and manipulate its host depends on its ability to transport proteins called GRAs into the host cell. GRAs have various roles in Toxoplasma's intracellular lifecycle, including hijacking host cell functions and proteins. However, the process of transporting these proteins across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) is not well understood.

Researchers have identified a novel protein complex essential for effector translocation across the PVM. The complex consists of three proteins: MYR1, MYR2, and MYR3. MYR2 and MYR3 are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole space and co-localize with the PVM and MYR1. These proteins are membrane-associated and play a crucial role in translocating a subset of GRAs into the host cell.

The researchers also found that fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured DHFR domain blocks the transport of other effectors, suggesting a translocon-based model of effector transport. This discovery reveals a novel complex at the PVM that is essential for effector translocation into the host cell. The identification of this complex provides new insights into the mechanisms of Toxoplasma's intracellular lifecycle and may lead to the development of new treatments for Toxoplasma infections.
Researchers studied how the human papillomavirus (HPV) and bovine papillomavirus (BPV) E2 protein interacts with the origin recognition complex (ORC) to initiate DNA replication. They found that the E2 protein binds to ORC2, a subunit of the ORC complex, but ORC2 is not present at the viral origin of replication. Surprisingly, depleting ORC2 actually increased viral replication in certain cell lines, suggesting that ORC2 suppresses the E2 protein's ability to initiate replication. The researchers also found that over-expressing the HPV E2 protein decreased the occupation of ORC2 at mammalian origins of replication, suggesting that E2 restricts the assembly of pre-ORC complexes that could compete with viral replication. This implies that the ORC2 complex with E2 restricts viral replication during the maintenance phase of the viral replication program. However, during the differentiation-dependent amplification stage, elevated levels of E2 can subvert ORC loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between viral and host replication factors during HPV replication.
A recent study investigated the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in the urban and peri-urban area of Dushanbe, Tajikistan. The researchers collected 564 cow milk samples from 326 herds in 21 villages and used a real-time PCR test to detect Brucella DNA. The results showed that 10.3% of the milk samples contained Brucella DNA. This finding is concerning because unpasteurized dairy products are commonly consumed in the region. The study also found that Brucella DNA was present in the milk of all seropositive cows, as well as 8.3% of seronegative cows. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene suggested that one cow was infected with B. abortus and another cow was likely infected with B. melitensis. The study highlights the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false serological negative individuals in Brucella surveillance, control, and eradication programs. The results also suggest that vaccination of cattle with S19, in addition to vaccination of small ruminants with Rev 1, may be necessary to control Brucella infections in the livestock population. However, further research is needed to understand the Brucella species circulating among the livestock in the region.
Researchers studied the role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation (H3K27me3) in maintaining chromosome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. This fungus has eight accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable and transcriptionally repressed. The researchers deleted the genes responsible for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, a different type of histone methylation, in Z. tritici and analyzed the effects on chromosome and genome stability. They found that the absence of H3K9me3 led to dramatic changes in chromatin structure, including the relocalization of H3K27me3 and the activation of transposable elements. This resulted in many genome rearrangements and the formation of new chromosomes. In contrast, the loss of H3K27me3 actually increased the stability of accessory chromosomes under normal growth conditions. The study suggests that H3K9me3 plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability by preventing H3K27me3 from accumulating in regions considered constitutive heterochromatin. The researchers conclude that H3K27me3 reduces the overall stability of accessory chromosomes, creating a "metastable" state for these quasi-essential regions of the genome.
Researchers evaluated the cost-effectiveness of different post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) vaccination regimens for rabies in low-income countries. They found that PEP vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention, costing between $200 to less than $60 per death averted. The study suggests that switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of PEP could significantly reduce costs and make the treatment more accessible to those in need. ID administration requires less vaccine volume, which could help mitigate vaccine shortages and reduce costs for healthcare providers.

The researchers analyzed the costs of IM versus ID administration of PEP vaccine in different settings, taking into account realistic constraints such as poor compliance. They found that ID delivery of PEP is more cost-effective than IM delivery in terms of averting rabies cases and saving lives. Clinic throughput affects the capacity for vial sharing, which impacts the cost-effectiveness of ID administration relative to IM.

The study highlights the need to increase accessibility and reduce costs of PEP, particularly for the poorest sectors of society who bear the largest burden of rabies. The researchers propose financing mechanisms to make PEP more affordable and accessible, including subsidies for those in need and support for rabies control and prevention programs. They conclude that a universal switch to ID delivery would improve the affordability and accessibility of PEP, leading to a likely reduction in human rabies deaths and cost savings for healthcare providers.
Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasite that infects mammalian cells, has developed a mechanism to acquire nutrients by attracting host organelles to its parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Researchers have discovered that Toxoplasma exploits host lipid droplets (LD), which are fat storage organelles, to obtain lipids. The study found that Toxoplasma replication is reduced in host cells that are depleted of LD or impaired in lipid metabolism. In infected cells, the number of host LD and the expression of genes associated with LD increase, and the PV is surrounded by host LD. Toxoplasma can access lipids stored in host LD and incorporate them into its own membranes and LD. The parasite can also intercept and internalize host LD, which are then wrapped by an intravacuolar network of membranes (IVN). Mutant parasites impaired in IVN formation have a reduced capacity to take up lipids from host LD. The study suggests that Toxoplasma relies on host LD for its intracellular development and can scavenge neutral lipids from host LD. The parasite's ability to access lipids from host LD is essential for its survival and replication, and may also be part of a host cell defense mechanism in response to parasite-mediated lipid imbalances.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds, called chalcones, that can inhibit a key enzyme in the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, a parasite that causes a widespread disease in cattle and sheep. The enzyme, called cathepsin L, is essential for the parasite's survival and ability to infect its host. The researchers tested a library of 40 flavonoid derivatives and found that chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups were effective inhibitors of the enzyme. One compound, C34, was found to be particularly effective, binding to the enzyme with a potency of 5.6 micromoles. The researchers also found that C34 reduced the parasite's ability to migrate through the gut wall and caused it to die within a week in a laboratory setting. This is significant because current treatments for the disease, such as the drug triclabendazole, are becoming less effective due to resistance. The discovery of C34 and other chalcones as potential inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cathepsins opens up new avenues for the development of novel treatments for the disease. These findings could also have implications for the treatment of other helminthic diseases.
Scientists have discovered a new way that the visual system processes information about changes in light intensity. The visual system uses two separate pathways to transmit information about fast and slow changes in light intensity. Researchers used a technique called in vivo imaging to study how bipolar cells, a type of neuron in the retina, transmit signals to the inner retina. They found that the size of the synaptic terminal, the part of the neuron where signals are transmitted, plays a crucial role in filtering these signals. Smaller terminals are better at transmitting high-frequency signals, while larger terminals are better at transmitting low-frequency signals. This is because smaller terminals release vesicles, which carry signals, more quickly and adapt more slowly to changes in light intensity. In contrast, larger terminals release vesicles more slowly and adapt more quickly. The researchers used a mathematical model to confirm that the size of the presynaptic compartment, the part of the neuron that releases vesicles, is responsible for these differences in response dynamics. This discovery provides new insights into how the visual system processes visual information and how it can transmit different temporal components of the visual signal through synaptic terminals of varying geometries with different adaptational properties.
Researchers have developed a new method for detecting and analyzing individual synapses in the brain using fluorescence microscopy. This technique, called probabilistic fluorescence-based synapse detection, allows for high-throughput analysis of synaptic networks and can identify diverse populations of synapses. The method combines the advantages of fluorescence microscopy, such as high speed and low cost, with the precision of electron microscopy, which is the current gold standard for synapse detection. The new approach uses a probabilistic model-based synapse detector that accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as user queries and delivers a volumetric map of the probability that each voxel represents part of a synapse. This method was tested using conjugate array tomography (cAT) data, which provides voxel-conjugate fluorescence and electron microscopy images of the same individual synapses. The results show that the algorithm detects synapses from fluorescence microscopy data alone as successfully as human annotators seeing only the fluorescence data, and accurately reproduces known architectural features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach opens the door to data-driven discovery of new synapse types and their density. The researchers suggest that this method will also be useful for analyzing standard confocal and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy images, where electron microscopy cross-validation is not practical.
Zinc is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression, and immune system function. Impairment of zinc homeostasis can lead to various human pathologies. In mammals, zinc transport occurs through two families of transporters: ZnT and ZIP. ZnT2, a member of the ZnT family, is responsible for accumulating zinc in vesicles and secreting it into breast milk during lactation. However, the mechanism of action of ZnT2 is not well understood.

Research has suggested that ZnT2 may be coupled to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles, but this has not been conclusively established. To investigate this, researchers modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 using computational and experimental methods. They found that ZnT2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter, meaning it uses the energy from the proton gradient to transport zinc into vesicles. This was demonstrated using functional zinc transport assays and inhibitors of the vacuolar-type proton ATPase, which alkalizes acidic vesicles.

The researchers also showed that overexpression of ZnT2 in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc led to alkalization of the vesicular pH, which was reversed by a zinc chelator. Computational energy calculations suggested that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H+/Zn2+ ions. This means that ZnT2 uses two protons to transport one zinc ion into the vesicles, concentrating zinc at the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm. Overall, the study provides evidence that ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger.
Researchers have discovered a new role for 14-3-3 proteins in maintaining genome stability during DNA replication. They found that 14-3-3 proteins interact with Exonuclease 1 (Exo1), an enzyme that processes stalled replication forks. In yeast and mammalian cells, 14-3-3 proteins help regulate Exo1's activity by controlling its phosphorylation status. When 14-3-3 proteins are absent, Exo1 becomes overactive, leading to the accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps at stalled forks. This causes persistent checkpoint activation and makes it harder for cells to recover from DNA replication stress. The researchers also found that 14-3-3 proteins promote fork progression under conditions of limited nucleotide availability. They propose that 14-3-3 proteins act as a platform to control Exo1's activity and other unknown targets, ensuring the stability and restart of replication forks in response to DNA replication stress. The study sheds light on the complex processes occurring at stalled replication forks and highlights the importance of 14-3-3 proteins in maintaining genome stability. Further research is needed to identify other components of the replisome that may be regulated by 14-3-3 proteins and to understand the exact mechanism by which they modulate Exo1's activity.
Researchers have investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis. They used a humanized mouse model to study the effects of pDC on HIV-1 replication and immunopathogenesis. The study found that pDC play a dual role in HIV-1 infection: they suppress HIV-1 replication by producing type I interferons (IFN-I), but also contribute to HIV-1-induced immunopathogenesis by promoting cell death of human leukocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T cells.

The researchers developed a monoclonal antibody that specifically depletes pDC in humanized mice, allowing them to study the effects of pDC depletion on HIV-1 infection. They found that depletion of pDC prior to HIV-1 infection abolished the induction of IFN-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) during acute HIV-1 infection. As a result, HIV-1 replication was significantly up-regulated in pDC-depleted mice. However, the cell death induced by the highly pathogenic HIV-1 isolate was severely reduced in pDC-depleted mice.

In chronic HIV-1 infection, depletion of pDC also reduced the induction of IFN-I and ISGs, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication. Surprisingly, HIV-1-induced depletion of human immune cells, including T cells, was reduced in lymphoid organs, despite increased viral replication. The study suggests that pDC depletion and IFN-I blockade may provide novel strategies for treating HIV-1 immune non-responsive patients with persistent immune activation despite effective anti-retrovirus treatment.
Researchers have discovered that sulforaphane, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, can block the infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in macrophages, a type of immune cell. Macrophages play a crucial role in the body's defense against infections, but they can also be vulnerable to HIV infection. The study found that sulforaphane activates a protein called Nrf2, which in turn blocks HIV infection in macrophages. This is the first time that Nrf2 has been shown to have anti-viral properties.

The researchers tested the effect of sulforaphane on HIV infection in various cell types, including primary macrophages, primary T cells, and cell lines. They found that sulforaphane blocked HIV infection in primary macrophages, but not in primary T cells or other cell lines. The study also showed that silencing Nrf2 with a genetic tool called siRNA increased HIV infectivity in macrophages, suggesting that Nrf2 is necessary for the anti-viral effect of sulforaphane.

The researchers found that sulforaphane blocks HIV infection after the virus has entered the cell, but before it has formed a circular DNA structure called a 2-LTR circle. This is similar to the mechanism of other anti-viral proteins, such as SAMHD1 and MX2, which are induced by interferon, a protein that helps fight off viral infections. However, unlike these proteins, sulforaphane does not upregulate SAMHD1 or MX2, suggesting that its anti-viral effect is mediated through Nrf2.
A study conducted in rural western Kenya found that 76.2% of pregnant women surveyed were infected with at least one type of geohelminth, a type of parasitic worm. The most common types of geohelminths found were Ascaris lumbricoides (52.3%), hookworm (39.5%), and Trichuris trichiura (29.0%). The study also found that geohelminth infections were associated with the use of an unprotected water source and the lack of treatment of drinking water, but not with clinical symptoms or low body mass index. However, a hookworm infection was associated with a lower mid-upper arm circumference, and a high egg count of hookworm was linked to lower hemoglobin levels. The study also found that pregnant women with Ascaris lumbricoides were less likely to have malaria parasitemia compared to those without the infection. The study suggests that routine provision of antihelminth treatment during antenatal clinic visits may be beneficial, but further research is needed to evaluate the impact on pregnancy, malaria, and birth outcomes.
Mycolactone, a compound produced by the skin pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been found to have anti-inflammatory effects on the nervous system. Researchers investigated whether mycolactone affects the inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia, which are involved in pain perception, transmission, and maintenance. They found that mycolactone suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by these cells without affecting their viability. This effect was observed in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In the in vivo study, mycolactone was injected into the spinal canal of rats with neuropathic pain, and it decreased the local production of inflammatory cytokines without causing detectable cytotoxicity. The study suggests that mycolactone's anti-inflammatory properties may contribute to its analgesic effects. Mycolactone has previously been shown to block the Sec61-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells, which may also contribute to its analgesic effects. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms of mycolactone's analgesic properties and may lead to the development of new treatments for chronic pain.
Researchers studied the genetic factors that influence the outcome of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a deadly disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. They collected DNA samples from 425 individuals in Guinea, including people with HAT, those with a long-term infection, and healthy individuals living in areas where the disease is common. The researchers focused on 28 genetic variations (SNPs) in eight genes and found associations between certain SNPs and the risk of developing HAT. Specifically, they found that the IL6 rs1818879 allele A was associated with a lower risk of progressing from a latent infection to active disease. In contrast, the MIF rs36086171 allele G and MIF rs12483859 C allele were associated with an increased risk of developing HAT. The researchers also confirmed previous findings that the APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) is associated with a higher risk of developing HAT, while the APOL1 G1 polymorphism is associated with a lower risk. No associations were found with other candidate genes. These findings suggest that host genetic factors play a role in modulating the outcome of T. brucei gambiense infection and may lead to the development of new control tools for the disease. The study contributes to the understanding of host-parasite interactions and the genetic basis of human susceptibility to trypanosomiasis.
Researchers conducted deep whole-genome sequencing on 38 individuals from the general population of Singapore, who are primarily descendants of immigrants from Dravidian-language-speaking states in south India. The study aimed to gain insights into the genetic structure and diversity of Asian Indians in Singapore. The results showed that the samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and a higher heterozygous-to-homozygous genotype ratio compared to other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Asian Indians, the genetic makeup of the samples was closely related to South Indians. However, eight samples were found to have mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans, indicating higher European admixture. An analysis of ancient admixture with archaic hominins, such as Denisovan and Neanderthal, revealed higher levels in East Asian populations than in the Singapore Indian samples. The study's data resource is now publicly available and is expected to complement the South Asian samples in Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project.
Researchers studied a rare type of Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterium that causes melioidosis, to understand why some strains are susceptible to certain antibiotics. They found that most B. pseudomallei strains are resistant to aminoglycosides and macrolides due to an efflux pump called AmrAB-OprA. However, three Thai strains, 708a, 2188a, and 3799a, were found to be susceptible to these antibiotics. The researchers discovered that strain 708a lacked the amrAB-oprA operon, which is responsible for the efflux pump, due to a large deletion of genetic material. In contrast, strains 2188a and 3799a had reduced levels of amrAB-oprA expression, which made them susceptible to aminoglycosides and macrolides. When these strains were exposed to increasing concentrations of gentamicin, they developed resistance to multiple antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and macrolides, due to upregulation of the amrAB-oprA operon. The researchers also found that strain 708a, despite lacking several virulence genes, was still fully virulent in a mouse model of melioidosis. This suggests that strain 708a could be a useful candidate for genetic manipulation experiments to study the role of the amrAB-oprA operon in antibiotic resistance.
Researchers studied how CD4 T helper cells, a type of immune cell, differentiate into two distinct types: Th1 and Th2 cells. These cells play a crucial role in fighting off infections and diseases. Traditionally, it was thought that a specific transcription factor, a molecule that controls gene expression, would drive the differentiation of these cells into one type or the other. However, this study found that in the early stages of differentiation, CD4 T cells exhibit a mixed Th1/Th2 state, where both types of transcription factors are present at high levels in individual cells.

The researchers observed that cytokines, signaling molecules that can activate or repress transcription factors, are expressed in a small subpopulation of cells, independently of the transcription factors. This variation in cytokine expression is much larger in the early stages of differentiation than in the fully differentiated state. When cytokine signaling is inhibited, the classic mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors is observed, revealing a weak intracellular network that is overruled by the strong signals from extracellular cytokines.

The study suggests that CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state early in their differentiation process, influenced by extracellular cytokines. This interplay between extracellular and intracellular signaling components may be a common strategy used by mammalian cells to buffer against noisy cytokine expression. The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex process of CD4 T cell differentiation and may have implications for our understanding of immune cell function and disease.
Researchers have identified a protein called PAQR-2 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) that plays a crucial role in the worm's ability to adapt to cold temperatures. PAQR-2 is similar to insulin-sensitizing receptors found in mammals and is essential for the worm's growth at temperatures as low as 15°C. To understand how PAQR-2 functions, the researchers screened for genetic mutations that suppress its activity and found several genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. They discovered that PAQR-2, phosphatidylcholines, and a protein called SBP-1 form a pathway that regulates the increase in unsaturated fatty acids necessary to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This pathway is essential for the worm's adaptation to cold temperatures, as evidenced by the normalization of saturated fatty acid levels and the rescue of the PAQR-2 mutant with low concentrations of detergents that increase membrane fluidity. The researchers propose that PAQR-2 regulates the activity of Δ9 desaturases, enzymes that convert saturated fatty acids into unsaturated ones, to maintain membrane fluidity during cold adaptation. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cold adaptation in C. elegans and highlights the importance of PAQR-2 in regulating fatty acid metabolism in response to temperature changes.
Researchers have used electron cryo-tomography to study the structure of human herpes simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virions, revealing a previously unknown feature at the portal vertex. This feature extends from the capsid to the viral membrane, forming a connection between the two. The location of this assembly suggests it plays a role in releasing the viral genome into the host cell's nucleus and is also important for the overall structure of the virus.

The discovery was made by comparing the structure of HSV-1 with that of tailed bacteriophages, which share a common evolutionary origin with herpesviruses. Tailed bacteriophages have a specialized tail-like structure that helps deliver their genome into bacterial cells. Although herpesviruses do not have a visible tail, the researchers found a similar structure at the portal vertex of HSV-1 virions, which may perform a similar function.

HSV-1 is a well-characterized virus that causes a range of diseases, from cold sores to cancer. The virus has a complex structure, consisting of a proteinaceous layer called the tegument, a glycoprotein-containing lipid envelope, and a capsid that contains the viral DNA genome. The discovery of the new feature at the portal vertex provides new insights into the structure and function of HSV-1 and may help researchers understand how the virus interacts with host cells.
Researchers studied how a protein from the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, called soluble egg antigen (SEA), affects the immune system's response to the HIV-1 virus. They found that SEA can block a specific way that HIV-1 infects immune cells, called trans-infection, by binding to a protein on the surface of immune cells called DC-SIGN. They also found that when immune cells, called T-cells, are exposed to SEA, they become less susceptible to HIV-1 infection. This effect was seen when the immune cells were matured in a way that promotes a type of immune response called Th2, but not when they were matured in other ways. The researchers also found that a similar effect was seen when they used a recombinant version of a protein called omega-1, which is similar to the natural protein found in the parasite. This protein, called rω-1, was able to induce T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 infection. The researchers also found that the T-cells exposed to SEA or rω-1 produced less of a protein called IFN-γ, which is involved in fighting off infections. Overall, the study suggests that SEA and rω-1 may have the potential to influence the course of HIV-1 infection in people who are co-infected with the parasite.
Researchers have found that when neurons are stimulated, the space between neurons and surrounding astrocytes, called the extracellular space (ECS), shrinks by about 30%. This phenomenon has been observed in both grey and white matter, but the underlying mechanisms were not well understood. A new study presents a dynamic model that explains how ECS shrinkage occurs. The model suggests that several factors contribute to ECS shrinkage, including the release of potassium and uptake of sodium by neurons, the uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride by astrocytes, the action of the Na/K/ATPase pump, and the transport of water through the astrocyte membrane. However, the study also found that two specific transporters, NKCC1 and NBC, play a crucial role in achieving the observed levels of ECS shrinkage. The model is based on the assumption that ECS shrinkage is caused by the redistribution of water and ions within the neuronal, astrocyte, and ECS compartments. The study suggests that measuring ECS shrinkage, membrane potential, and ion concentrations in different individuals and conditions is necessary to further understand this phenomenon. The model provides a framework for future experiments and can help develop more comprehensive models of astroglia-neuron interactions in both normal and pathological situations.
Scientists have long known that certain types of DNA, called transposons and repetitive elements, can be detrimental to an organism if they are transcribed. To prevent this, these elements are silenced through a process called transcriptional gene silencing. In plants, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, this process involves small RNA molecules that guide a protein called ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) to specific locations in the DNA, where it recruits enzymes to establish repressive chromatin modifications. However, it was unclear how these enzymes are recruited to the DNA.

   Researchers have discovered that a protein called SPT5L/KTF1 binds to chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes, at locations where transcriptional silencing occurs. This binding happens after the action of an enzyme called RNA Polymerase V, but does not require the presence of a specific type of small RNA molecule called 24-nt siRNA. Furthermore, SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are recruited to chromatin independently of each other.

   The study found that both SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 are necessary for the establishment of repressive chromatin modifications, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, at specific locations. The researchers propose that the simultaneous binding of SPT5L/KTF1 and AGO4 creates a platform for the recruitment of chromatin-modifying enzymes. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional gene silencing and the role of SPT5L/KTF1 in this process.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, relies on a protein called RpoS to transmit the disease from ticks to mammals. RpoS is an alternative sigma factor that regulates gene expression, and its role in the tick phase of the enzootic cycle has not been well understood. The study found that RpoS-dependent gene expression is essential for the transmission of spirochetes by feeding nymphs, and that RpoS-deficient organisms are unable to traverse the midgut of the tick. Instead, they form an unusual morphotype called round bodies, which is a default survival mode triggered when the spirochetes are unable to produce enough energy for transmission. This round body formation is reversible and appears to be caused by reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, an enzyme that provides NAD+ for glycolysis. The study also found that RpoS is induced during the nymphal blood meal, but not in replete larvae or unfed nymphs, suggesting a complex regulation of RpoS-dependent genes in the tick phase of the enzootic cycle. Overall, the research highlights the importance of RpoS in the transmission of Lyme disease and provides new insights into the physiological adaptations required for tick-to-mammal transmission.
Plant hormones gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) play crucial roles in regulating stamen development in Arabidopsis. A deficiency in GA causes male sterility due to the accumulation of DELLA proteins, while a deficiency in JA also leads to male sterility. Researchers investigated the relationship between GA and JA in controlling stamen development and found that three MYB genes, MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, are GA-dependent and stamen-enriched genes. Loss-of-function of two DELLAs, RGA and RGL2, restored the expression of these three MYB genes and stamen filament growth in GA-deficient plants. Genetic analysis showed that a triple mutant of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57 resulted in a short stamen phenotype leading to male sterility. Further studies revealed that GA suppresses DELLAs to mobilize the expression of the key JA biosynthesis gene DAD1, leading to increased JA content in young flower buds. The researchers concluded that GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57, establishing a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in regulating stamen development. The study also found that other GA-regulated JA-independent factors are necessary for normal stamen filament development. Exogenous application of GA to GA-deficient plants induced the expression of MYB21, MYB24, and MYB57 and recovered normal floral development.
Researchers investigated the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in the lifespan extension caused by dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode worm. They found that HIF-1 deficiency led to extended lifespan, similar to the effect of inhibiting the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, a key regulator of growth and metabolism. HIF-1 is a transcription factor that plays a role in various biological processes, including oxygen homeostasis and cell survival. The researchers used a modified DR method to study the relationship between HIF-1 and lifespan extension. They found that HIF-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner, with HIF-1 deficiency extending lifespan under rich nutrient conditions but not under DR. Conversely, increased HIF-1 activity diminished lifespan extension under DR. The researchers also found that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE-1) is involved in the lifespan extension caused by HIF-1 or DR, and that lower levels of ER stress are associated with increased lifespan. These findings suggest that HIF-1 plays a tissue-specific role in the lifespan extension caused by DR, involving the IRE-1 ER stress pathway.
A recent study has shed light on how human skin cells called keratinocytes transition between different states, such as differentiating and migrating. Researchers found that when keratinocytes differentiate or migrate, they form unique groups of genetic elements called enhancers and super-enhancers that are specific to each state. These super-enhancers are linked to genes that give the cells their specific functions. The study focused on a transcription factor called GRHL3, which is involved in both differentiation and migration. GRHL3 binds to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes, while in migrating keratinocytes, it binds to promoters and represses the expression of genes that inhibit migration. The researchers also found that GRHL3 is essential for normal keratinocyte migration during eyelid closure and wound healing. The study suggests that GRHL3 can regulate different gene expression programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes by changing where it binds to chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes. This regulatory relationship between GRHL3 and chromatin is not only important for cell type specification but also for reversible cell states, such as migration. The study provides new insights into how a single transcription factor can control distinct gene expression programs in the same cell type.
Researchers studied the relationship between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and exogenous retroviruses in sheep. ERVs are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that are passed down from generation to generation. The study found that some ERVs can interfere with the replication of related exogenous retroviruses, suggesting that they may be used by the host as a defense mechanism. The researchers isolated and characterized 27 ERVs from sheep and found that two of them, enJSRV-56A1 and enJSRV-20, acquired a defective Gag polyprotein that blocks the replication of related exogenous retroviruses. These two ERVs became fixed in the host genome before or around the time of sheep domestication, around 9,000 years ago. A third ERV, enJSRV-26, emerged more recently, likely within the last 200 years, and is able to escape the defense mechanism of the other two ERVs. This suggests that the evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses in sheep is a continuous process. The study provides evidence that ERVs have been used by the host to fight exogenous pathogenic retroviral infections. The findings suggest that the host and retroviruses have co-evolved over time, with the host developing defense mechanisms to counter the retroviruses, and the retroviruses adapting to evade these defenses.
Researchers have developed a new method for diagnosing schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma worms, using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) technology. The current standard method for diagnosing schistosomiasis involves microscopic examination of stool or urine samples, but this method has low sensitivity and can be time-consuming. The new PCR method targets the genetic material of the Schistosoma worms and can detect the presence of the parasite in various samples, including stool, urine, biopsies, and serum.

The study evaluated the performance of the PCR method on 412 samples from patients suspected of having schistosomiasis. The results showed that the PCR method significantly increased the sensitivity of diagnosis compared to microscopic examination, detecting 10.5% of Schistosoma haematobium infections in urine samples and 48.8% of Schistosoma mansoni infections in stool samples. The PCR method also detected 72.7% of Schistosoma infections in serum samples, with a specificity of 98.9%.

The study suggests that the PCR method can be used in combination with other diagnostic methods, such as Western Blot-based serology, to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The PCR method can also be used to monitor treatment efficacy, as the levels of Schistosoma DNA in serum samples decreased over time after treatment. However, the study found that antibody detection remained positive for up to one year after treatment, indicating that PCR may not be useful for early treatment monitoring.
Researchers have developed a new way to estimate the energy of complex molecules using machine learning. This method, called Gaussian process regression, can quickly predict the energy of a molecule's different conformations, or shapes. The team tested this approach on a molecule called Archazolid A, which is a potent inhibitor of a type of enzyme found in cells. Archazolid A is produced by a type of bacteria called Archangium gephyra.

The researchers used machine learning to analyze the relationship between the shape of Archazolid A and its energy. They created a simple mathematical representation of the molecule's structure and used this to train a machine learning model. The model was then used to predict the energy of new conformations of Archazolid A.

The results showed that the machine learning model was able to accurately predict the energy of the molecule's conformations, with an average error of less than 1 kilocalorie per mole. This is a significant improvement over traditional methods, which can take a long time to calculate the energy of complex molecules.

The researchers believe that this approach could be used to speed up simulations of larger molecular structures, which is important for understanding how molecules interact with each other and their environment. This could have implications for the development of new medicines and other applications.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect ebolavirus antibodies in wild great apes, specifically in their feces. This non-invasive approach allows for the monitoring of ebolavirus infections in wild ape populations, which is crucial for understanding the impact of the virus on these animals. The study found that 10% of gorillas in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DCO) region tested positive for ebolavirus antibodies, indicating that exposure to the virus is not uniformly lethal in this species. The researchers also detected antibodies in gorillas that were previously thought to be unexposed to ebolavirus, suggesting that the virus may be more widespread than previously thought.

This new method has significant implications for protecting great apes from future ebolavirus infections. It can be used to identify populations that are at risk of infection and target them for vaccination. Additionally, the method can help track the effectiveness of vaccines if they are implemented. The study's findings also have important public health implications, as ebolavirus can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected wildlife carcasses, leading to high case-fatality rates in local communities.

The researchers used a non-invasive immunological assay to detect ebolavirus antibodies in fecal samples collected from wild great apes. This approach is sensitive and specific, allowing for the detection of multiple ebolavirus species with minimal false positive results. The study's results demonstrate the potential of this method for monitoring ebolavirus infections in wild great ape populations and inform strategies for protecting these animals from future outbreaks.
Researchers have identified a new type of protein, called XopL, produced by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which causes disease in tomato and pepper plants. This protein, known as a type III effector, is injected into plant cells by the bacterium and can manipulate the plant's immune system and gene expression. The study found that XopL has a unique E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which is a function typically found in eukaryotic cells. This activity is associated with the C-terminal region of XopL and is necessary for inducing plant cell death and suppressing the plant's immune response.

The researchers also determined the three-dimensional structure of the C-terminal region of XopL, which revealed a novel fold called the XL-box. This fold is not found in any other known E3 ubiquitin ligases. Mutations in the XL-box disrupted XopL's E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and prevented it from inducing plant cell death. The study also found that the N-terminal region of XopL contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which may be involved in recognizing and interacting with ubiquitination targets.

The discovery of XopL's unique E3 ubiquitin ligase activity and structure highlights the diversity of bacterial pathogen effectors that have evolved to mimic eukaryotic functions, such as ubiquitination, to subvert host biology. This research provides new insights into the complex interactions between plants and bacterial pathogens and may have implications for the development of new strategies to control plant diseases.
Researchers studied the interaction between T follicular helper cells (cTfh) and B cells in people with early and late acute HIV infection. They found that cTfh function was impaired in individuals treated in the late stage of acute infection compared to those treated in the early stage. This impairment was associated with lower B cell survival and IgG secretion. The study also found that inflammation played a role in altering cTfh and B cell responses, and that elevated plasma viral load was linked to decreased cTfh-mediated B cell IgG production. Additionally, the researchers observed phenotypic perturbations in the mature B cell compartment, including a decrease in resting memory B cells in the late stage of acute infection. The study suggests that early antiretroviral treatment (ART) for acutely HIV-infected individuals could prevent immune dysregulation and preserve cTfh function and B cell memory. The findings indicate that cTfh-mediated B cell responses are significantly altered in the late stage of acute HIV infection compared to the early stage, and that identifying individuals early on during HIV infection has the potential to preserve cTfh-dependent B cell responses. Overall, the study highlights the importance of early ART in preventing immune dysregulation and preserving immune function in HIV-infected individuals.
Researchers have identified a new target for developing more effective treatments for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, has several drawbacks, making it essential to find new anthelmintics. To achieve this, scientists have profiled a specific receptor in the parasite, called Sm.5HTR, which is involved in serotonin signaling. This receptor is a type of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), which is a common target for many human therapeutics.

A miniaturized screening assay was used to identify new compounds that selectively target Sm.5HTR over its human homolog, Hs.5HTR7. The results showed that Sm.5HTR has a distinct pharmacological signature compared to Hs.5HTR7, making it a promising target for anthelmintic development. The researchers identified new ligands and compound series that are potent and selective for Sm.5HTR, and validated their efficacy against schistosomules and adult worms in vitro and in vivo.

The study also found that Sm.5HTR exhibits an unusual property called irreversible inactivation, which is similar to a phenomenon observed in Hs.5HTR7. This characteristic makes Sm.5HTR an attractive target for developing next-generation anthelmintics. Overall, this research demonstrates the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in a high-throughput screening format and highlights the potential of Sm.5HTR as a chemotherapeutically vulnerable node for developing new treatments for schistosomiasis.
Researchers have found that the separation of germ layers in embryos is not solely due to differences in cell adhesion between the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Instead, a signaling mechanism involving ephrinB and EphB plays a crucial role in detaching cells at the boundary between the ectoderm and mesoderm. This detachment is necessary for the ectoderm to serve as a substrate for mesoderm migration during embryonic development.

Studies in various organisms, including flies, fish, and amphibians, have shown that the ectoderm-mesoderm boundary must be compatible with repeated cell attachment and detachment. The researchers found that ephrinB ligands and EphB receptors are expressed on both sides of the boundary and that tissue separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary in both directions. This process involves partially redundant ligands and receptors, as well as the activation of RhoA and Rac, which regulate cytoskeletal dynamics.

In contrast to the traditional view that germ layer separation is solely due to differential adhesion, this study suggests that localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle are necessary for cell migration across a cellular substratum. The researchers propose that this mechanism is conserved in other organisms, such as zebrafish and Drosophila, where a cleft-like ectoderm-mesoderm boundary is also observed.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 neurotypical children to better understand the underlying biology of ASD. They measured metabolite concentrations in the folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways. Using advanced statistical analysis, they were able to correctly classify 96.1% of the neurotypical children and 97.6% of the children with ASD. This is a significant improvement over previous studies that only found differences in mean metabolite levels between the two groups.

The researchers also used the statistical analysis to predict adaptive behavior in children with ASD, as measured by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite score. They found that measuring just five metabolites of the pathways was enough to predict the Vineland score with an accuracy of 0.45. This is a promising result, as it suggests that biochemical data could be used to support behavioral diagnoses and enable earlier and more accurate diagnoses of ASD.

The study used a combination of advanced statistical analysis tools, including Fisher Discriminant Analysis and kernel partial least squares, to extract important information from the complex biochemical data. The results suggest that the metabolites under consideration are strongly correlated with an ASD diagnosis, and that the statistical analysis used here offers tremendous potential for extracting important information from complex biochemical data sets. The study's findings have the potential to improve our understanding of the underlying biology of ASD and could lead to the development of new diagnostic tools.
Researchers analyzed data on leishmaniasis cases in Brazil from 2001 to 2010 to better understand the disease's patterns and risk factors. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that affects 98 countries and 350 million people worldwide, with Brazil being one of the most severely affected countries. The study used a statistical method called Bayesian geostatistical modeling to identify the most important environmental, climatic, and socioeconomic factors contributing to the disease.

The researchers found that precipitation and socioeconomic factors were significant risk factors for both cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis, a type of leishmaniasis that affects the skin and internal organs, respectively. The study predicted that in 2010, there were approximately 30,189 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis and 4,889 cases of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. The researchers also created high-resolution maps to identify areas with the highest numbers of infected people, which were found to be in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis, respectively.

The study's findings suggest that targeting these high-risk areas with control efforts could help reduce the incidence of leishmaniasis in Brazil. The researchers used a statistical approach that took into account the spatial and temporal patterns of the disease, providing a more accurate understanding of the disease's distribution and risk factors than previous studies.
Researchers in Vietnam studied the clinical features of dengue fever in 1,528 patients, including 647 adults and 881 children, who were admitted to a hospital in southern Vietnam. They found that adults and children with dengue experienced different patterns of complications. Children were more likely to have signs of vascular leakage and shock, while adults were more likely to experience bleeding and organ involvement. Adults also had significantly lower platelet counts than children, a condition known as thrombocytopenia. The study found that secondary infection, but not the type of dengue virus, was associated with more severe thrombocytopenia in adults. Additionally, the researchers discovered that adults had lower platelet counts even after recovering from the disease, suggesting that healthy adults naturally have lower platelet counts than children. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the differences in dengue symptoms between adults and children, which can inform research on the disease's pathogenesis and guide the development of age-specific management guidelines. The study's results also suggest that the use of prophylactic platelet transfusions in adults with dengue may not be necessary, as only a small number of patients required them in this study.
Researchers studied SIVsmm, a virus that infects sooty mangabeys, to understand why it does not cause disease in its natural hosts despite high levels of virus replication. They found a novel mutation in the CCR5 gene, which codes for a protein that HIV and SIV use to enter cells, in 26% of sooty mangabeys. This mutation, called CCR5Δ2, results in a non-functional protein that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry in the lab. The researchers also found that 8% of the animals were homozygous for this mutation, meaning they had two copies of the defective gene, and 41% were heterozygous, meaning they had one copy of the defective gene and one copy of the normal gene.

Despite the lack of functional CCR5, the animals were still susceptible to SIVsmm infection and had high levels of the virus in their blood. The researchers found that the virus used alternative entry pathways, such as CXCR6, GPR15, and GPR1, in addition to CCR5, to infect cells. This suggests that the virus can replicate efficiently in cells that do not express CCR5, which may explain why it does not cause disease in its natural hosts. The findings have implications for understanding how SIV and HIV infect cells and how to develop new treatments for HIV.
Researchers have found that a protein called MEF2 plays a complex role in the development of a type of cancer called leiomyosarcoma (LMS). MEF2 can either help or hinder the growth of cancer cells, depending on its interactions with other proteins. When MEF2 teams up with certain proteins called co-activators, it can promote the growth of cancer cells. However, when it interacts with other proteins called co-repressors, it can actually slow down the growth of cancer cells. This dual role of MEF2 is crucial in determining the aggressiveness of LMS. In some cases, high levels of MEF2 and certain co-repressors, called class IIa HDACs, are associated with poor patient outcomes. In fact, over 20% of LMS patients have high levels of class IIa HDACs, which is linked to lower overall survival rates. The researchers found that knocking out one of these co-repressors, called HDAC9, can suppress the growth of cancer cells and restore the normal functioning of certain genes controlled by MEF2. This suggests that targeting class IIa HDACs, particularly HDAC9, could be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating LMS. The study's findings also highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between MEF2 and other proteins in the development of cancer.
Researchers have used a combination of techniques, including protein docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and electron cryo-microscopy, to study the structure of hydrophobin films composed of two class II hydrophobins, HFBI and HFBII, produced by the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Hydrophobins are proteins that play a crucial role in how fungi interact with their environment and have potential applications in nanotechnology. The study aimed to gain a detailed understanding of the surface structure of hydrophobin films at the air-water interface.

The researchers found that the experimentally observed unit cell size for the 2-D crystal structure of the hydrophobins matches one of the lattice vectors of a close-packed arrangement of the proteins, suggesting a unit cell composed of six proteins. However, computational results suggested a unit cell with P6 symmetry, while experimental results showed P3 symmetry with a unit cell size of 56 Å. The researchers also proposed an alternate ordering with a three-protein unit cell with P3 symmetry and a smaller unit cell size.

Using a Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydrophobin film, the researchers showed that this alternate metastable structure may play a role in increasing the rate of surface coverage by hydrophobin films. This could indicate a mechanism of more general significance to both biology and nanotechnology. The study provides new insights into the structure and properties of hydrophobin films, which have potential applications in fields such as biotechnology and materials science.
Researchers have identified Leishmania donovani threonyl tRNA synthetase (LdThrRS) as a potential target for antileishmanial drug development. LdThrRS is an enzyme essential for protein synthesis in the parasite, which causes visceral leishmaniasis. The study characterized the enzyme's activity and subcellular localization in L. donovani, a protozoan parasite. Recombinant LdThrRS was expressed in E. coli and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that LdThrRS is localized to both the cytosol and mitochondria.

Heterozygous mutants of LdThrRS were generated in Leishmania promastigotes, which showed a restrictive growth phenotype and attenuated infectivity. These mutants were also more susceptible to inhibition by the known ThrRS inhibitor, borrelidin. However, attempts to obtain ThrRS homozygous null mutants were unsuccessful, indicating the enzyme's essentiality for the parasite's survival. Borrelidin showed a strong affinity for LdThrRS, with a dissociation constant (KD) of 0.04 μM, and inhibited the aminoacylation activity of the enzyme with an IC50 of 0.06 μM. The study suggests that LdThrRS is a promising target for antileishmanial drug development, as it is essential for the parasite's survival and can bind to small drug-like molecules with strong affinity.
Researchers have identified a specific sequence in the RNA of the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) that triggers the body's innate immune response. This sequence, known as the poly-U/UC tract, contains a 34-nucleotide poly-uridine "core" that is essential for recognition by the protein RIG-I. RIG-I is a key player in the innate immune response, which is the body's first line of defense against viral infections. The poly-U/UC tract also contains interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides, which are necessary for optimal activation of RIG-I. When the poly-U/UC tract is attached to a 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp) group, it is recognized as non-self by RIG-I, leading to the activation of the innate immune response. This response involves the production of signaling molecules that alert the immune system to the presence of the virus. The researchers found that HCV RNA variants that strongly activated RIG-I signaling triggered potent anti-HCV responses in laboratory experiments and in a mouse model of infection. The study provides new insights into how the body recognizes and responds to HCV infection, and may lead to the development of new therapies to combat the virus. The researchers identified a multi-motif signature of non-self recognition by RIG-I, which includes a 5'-ppp and a poly-uridine sequence composition and length. This signature drives potent RIG-I signaling to induce the innate immune response to infection.
Researchers have found that eosinophils, a type of immune cell, play a crucial role in supporting the growth of a type of parasitic worm called Trichinella spiralis in the host's skeletal muscle. Eosinophils produce a protein called IL-4, which is necessary for the normal growth of the worm larvae. The study found that eosinophils from mice that are capable of producing IL-4 are sufficient to support the growth of the larvae, even in the absence of an adaptive immune response. The researchers observed that the presence of eosinophils suppressed local inflammation and influenced nutrient homeostasis in the infected muscle tissue. They also found that the eosinophils promoted glucose uptake and glycogen storage in the muscle cells, which is essential for the growth of the larvae. The study suggests that the worms have evolved a strategy to co-opt the host's innate immune response to facilitate their growth. The researchers propose that eosinophils promote larval growth by limiting the host's interferon-driven responses, which would otherwise alter nutrient metabolism in the infected muscle. The findings provide new insights into the complex interaction between the parasite and the host, and highlight the role of eosinophils in supporting the growth of the worm larvae.
A recent study has challenged the long-held view that mammalian chromosomes consist of large domains of coordinated origin firing separated by originless transition regions. Researchers analyzed DNA replication kinetics in human HeLa cells and found that replication origins are spaced about 40 kilobases apart and fire in small clusters. These clusters become more synchronized as the cell progresses through the S phase of the cell cycle. The study also found that replication fork velocity remains constant and narrowly distributed throughout the S phase, contradicting the idea of large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Instead, the data suggest that replication timing gradients are set by the delay and spacing between successive origin firings, rather than the velocity of single forks. The researchers used DNA combing to demonstrate that internal origins in a specific temporal transition region are activated sequentially during the S phase. This finding was corroborated by analysis of published origin maps and replication timing data in other cell types, with the exception of embryonic stem cells, which show more regions of unidirectional fork progression. The study provides new insights into the replication timing program of mammalian genomes and proposes a general model for their replication kinetics, suggesting that origins fire independently of each other but under the control of long-range chromatin structure, or that replication forks stimulate initiation in nearby unreplicated DNA.
Researchers investigated how the nervous system can efficiently recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting conditions. They proposed that this ability is learned by exploiting the fact that object identities typically vary more slowly in time than contextual variables or noise. The study explored how this "temporal stability" or "slowness" approach can be implemented within the limits of biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. The researchers showed that slow feature analysis, an algorithm based on slowness, can be implemented in linear continuous model neurons using a modified Hebbian learning rule. This approach provides a link to the trace rule, another implementation of slowness learning. They also demonstrated that for linear Poisson neurons, slowness learning can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific learning window. The study analyzed the learning dynamics of STDP and found that the learning window alone is not relevant, but rather the convolution of the learning window with the postsynaptic potential. The researchers derived STDP learning windows that implement slow feature analysis and the "trace rule" and found that these windows are compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. The study suggests that the learning window can be split into two functionally different components that are sensitive to reversible and irreversible aspects of the input statistics.
Researchers have discovered a new way that cancer cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) develop resistance to chemotherapy. This phenomenon, called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), occurs when cancer cells with different genetic and phenotypic features work together to become resistant to treatment. When exposed to chemotherapy, these cells induce changes in neighboring cells that make them more resistant to the treatment. This means that even if some cells in the tumor are sensitive to the chemotherapy, they can still become resistant if they are surrounded by cells that have adapted to the treatment.

To study this phenomenon, researchers used a three-dimensional in vitro culture platform to grow NSCLC cells with different genetic mutations. They found that when these cells were exposed to chemotherapy, they quickly adapted and became resistant to the treatment. This resistance was not due to genetic mutations, but rather to changes in the behavior of the cells. The researchers used mathematical modeling and flow cytometry to understand how the cells interacted with each other and how they became resistant to the treatment.

The study suggests that current approaches to treating cancer, which focus on identifying genetic mutations that can be targeted by drugs, may not be enough to overcome resistance. Instead, researchers need to consider how cancer cells interact with each other and how they adapt to treatment. This new understanding could lead to more effective treatments for NSCLC and other types of cancer.
A study conducted in the Mbeya Region of Southwestern Tanzania found a high seroprevalence of Spotted Fever Group (SFG) rickettsiae, with 67.9% of participants above the age of 5 years testing positive for IgG antibodies. The study, which involved 1,228 participants, aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of SFG rickettsiae and assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. The results showed that SFG-seropositivity was associated with age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density. At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher seroprevalence. The study suggests that SFG rickettsial infection is common in the rural population of Mbeya Region and that its spread may be limited by temperature and higher elevation. The findings are consistent with previous descriptions of SFG rickettsioses in sub-Saharan Africa and highlight the need for further research to determine the disease burden and transmission cycle of SFG rickettsiae in the region. The study's results also suggest that SFG rickettsiae may contribute to the burden of febrile illnesses in the population. Future studies should aim to detect the pathogen in acute infection and describe the local transmission cycle to validate the identified risk factors.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for the fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The study found that oleate, a monounsaturated fatty acid, is necessary for the activation of immune defense genes in response to pathogen infection. The researchers identified two enzymes responsible for producing oleate in C. elegans and showed that animals deficient in oleate production are more susceptible to infection with various human pathogens. However, the addition of exogenous oleate can rescue this susceptibility, suggesting that oleate plays a key role in innate immunity.

The study also found that oleate affects immune activation in a distinct way from other fatty acids, such as gamma-linolenic acid and stearidonic acid, which have previously been shown to be important for innate immunity in C. elegans. The researchers ruled out the possibility that oleate's effect on immunity is due to its conversion to these other fatty acids. Instead, they found that oleate supplementation can rescue the immune activation defect in animals lacking a specific enzyme involved in oleate production.

These findings suggest that oleate is essential for the innate immune response in C. elegans and that its absence makes animals more susceptible to infection. The study highlights the importance of oleate in innate immunity and provides new insights into the relationship between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection. The discovery of oleate's role in innate immunity adds to the growing understanding of the health-promoting effects of monounsaturated fatty acids.
Scientists have discovered a new way to fight bacterial infections by targeting a specific type of genetic switch called a riboswitch. Riboswitches regulate gene expression in response to certain molecules, and in the case of guanine riboswitches, they control the production of purine metabolites, which are essential for cell growth. When guanine binds to the riboswitch, it stabilizes a specific structure in the messenger RNA, causing the cell to stop producing certain proteins. Researchers created a compound called PC1 that binds to guanine riboswitches and selectively kills certain types of bacteria, including some that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. This compound works by targeting a specific gene called guaA, which is controlled by the riboswitch. The researchers tested PC1 in a mouse model and found that it reduced the severity of Staphylococcus aureus infections in the mammary glands. This breakthrough has the potential to lead to the development of new antibiotics that target guanine riboswitches, which could be effective against a wide range of bacterial infections. The discovery of this new target is particularly important as community-acquired bacterial infections are becoming increasingly resistant to existing antibiotics. By designing compounds that bind to guanine riboswitches, scientists may be able to create powerful and selective antimicrobial agents that can combat these infections.
Researchers studied how macaque monkeys navigate a virtual reality maze to find a reward. They found that cells in the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory and navigation, respond to a monkey's gaze, head direction, and task context. These cells are similar to "place cells" found in rodents, but in primates, they also take into account the target of the monkey's gaze. This means that the cells are not just responding to the monkey's location, but also to what the monkey is looking at and what it needs to do to reach the reward. The researchers found that the activity of these cells can be described as a "fine-grained state space" that includes the monkey's current position, view, and action context. This suggests that the hippocampus in primates is not just a simple map of space, but a complex system that takes into account multiple factors to help the monkey navigate. The study's findings are consistent with previous research in rodents and provide new insights into how primates, including humans, construct mental maps of their environment. The research has implications for our understanding of how the brain processes spatial information and how it relates to self-awareness and navigation. Overall, the study shows that the hippocampus in primates is a sophisticated system that integrates multiple sources of information to help the animal navigate its environment.
Researchers studied the development of the mid- and hindbrain in vertebrates, focusing on the mid-hindbrain boundary (MHB). They found that a specific pattern of gene expression around the MHB is crucial for its formation and maintenance. This pattern is controlled by a network of regulatory interactions between several genes, including Otx2, Gbx2, Fgf8, Wnt1, En, and Pax. By analyzing the spatial expression patterns of these genes using a Boolean model, the researchers identified key regulatory interactions in the network. They discovered that Fgf8 maintains, rather than induces, Wnt1 expression, which was previously unclear. This finding was confirmed through experiments using mouse anterior neural plate/tube explants. The researchers also constructed a regulatory network between the key transcription and secreted factors at the MHB, which was able to explain the stable maintenance of the MHB and the time-courses of expression patterns under different conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial gene expression patterns can be used to gain information about the structure of regulatory networks, similar to temporal patterns. The findings provide new insights into the maintenance of the MHB on a systems level.
Researchers have discovered how the parasite Theileria annulata interacts with the host cell's microtubule (MT) network. The parasite, which infects host cells and causes uncontrolled cell growth, uses the host cell's MTs to secure its distribution between daughter cells during cell division. To understand how this interaction occurs, the researchers focused on the plus ends of growing MTs, which are dynamic and constantly switching between growth and shrinkage. They found that the parasite recruits a protein called end-binding protein 1 (EB1), a key regulator of host cell MT dynamics, through a specific interaction with a parasite protein called p104. This interaction is mediated by a specific sequence of amino acids in p104, known as a SxIP motif. The parasite's interaction with EB1 is also regulated by the host cell's cell cycle. This is the first time a pathogen-encoded protein has been shown to interact with EB1 in this way. The study provides new insights into how Theileria interacts with the host cell's cytoskeleton, which is crucial for the parasite's persistence in its host. The researchers suggest that this interaction is essential for the parasite's ability to distribute itself evenly between daughter cells during cell division.
Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that helps protect the ends of chromosomes, called telomeres, from damage. Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with neighboring chromosomes. When DNA replication goes awry, it can lead to breaks in the chromosome, which can be repaired through a process called break-induced replication (BIR). In yeast cells, researchers found that a protein called Pif1 plays a crucial role in BIR and telomere lengthening. When Pif1 is phosphorylated, or modified, in response to DNA damage, it helps to promote telomere lengthening and prevent the formation of new telomeres at broken DNA ends. This is important because new telomeres can be unstable and lead to genetic problems. The researchers found that the phosphorylation of Pif1 is necessary for its role in BIR and telomere elongation, and that cells lacking Pif1 have longer telomeres and a higher frequency of new telomere formation at broken DNA ends. They propose that the passage of BIR forks through telomeres promotes telomerase activity, leading to telomere lengthening. This mechanism may also explain why some yeast mutants with impaired DNA replication have longer telomeres. The study provides new insights into how cells protect their chromosomes from damage and how telomeres are maintained.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool for onchocerciasis, a parasitic infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The tool, called luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS), uses a mixture of four recombinantly produced Onchocerca volvulus antigens to detect the presence of the parasite. The antigens, Ov-FAR-1, Ov-API-1, Ov-MSA-1, and Ov-CPI-1, were tested on a large cohort of sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onchocerca volvulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis.

The results showed that the LIPS assay had 100% sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera from uninfected control sera. The assay was also able to differentiate between Onchocerca volvulus-infected sera and sera from patients infected with other filarial parasites, such as Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongyloides stercoralis. The four-antigen LIPS assay was found to be a rapid, high-throughput, and specific tool for diagnosing individual Onchocerca volvulus infections and for early detection of recrudescent infections in areas under control and for mapping new areas of transmission of Onchocerca volvulus infection.
A 54-month iron-folic acid and de-worming program was implemented in a rural population of women in northern Vietnam to assess its effectiveness in reducing anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted helminth infections. The program involved weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and regular de-worming. The study found that after 54 months, 76% of participants were taking the iron-folic acid supplement and 95% had taken the most recent deworming treatment. As a result, the mean hemoglobin level increased from 122 g/L to 131 g/L, and the prevalence of anemia decreased from 38% to 18%. Iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8%, and iron deficiency anemia was reduced to 4%. The prevalence of hookworm infection decreased from 76% to 11%, and the level of moderate or heavy infestation of any soil-transmitted helminth was reduced to less than 1%. The study suggests that population-based interventions can efficiently and effectively reduce anemia and practically eliminate iron deficiency anemia and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted helminth infections, maintaining them below the level of public health concern.
Scientists have discovered a new way that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) evades the immune system. EBV is a common virus that infects most people at some point in their lives, but it can cause serious problems in people with weakened immune systems. To avoid being detected by the immune system, EBV produces a protein called gp150. This protein is heavily coated with sugars, or glycans, that create a shield around the surface of infected cells. This shield prevents the immune system from recognizing the cells as infected and attacking them.

The researchers found that gp150 blocks the presentation of antigens, or foreign substances, on the surface of infected cells. Antigens are what the immune system uses to recognize and attack infected cells. By blocking antigen presentation, gp150 prevents the immune system from activating T cells, which are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in fighting off infections.

The researchers also found that gp150 is not essential for the virus to enter, assemble, or leave the cell. This suggests that gp150's main function is to help the virus evade the immune system, rather than play a role in the virus's life cycle. The discovery of gp150 provides new insights into how EBV evades the immune system and could lead to the development of new treatments for EBV-related diseases.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Tarp plays a crucial role in the invasion of host cells by the bacterium Chlamydia. Tarp is a conserved protein among all pathogenic Chlamydial species, meaning it is present in all strains that cause disease. The study found that Tarp's ability to bind to actin, a protein that provides structure to cells, is essential for the bacterium's invasion of host cells. In fact, a peptide antiserum that blocks Tarp's actin-binding domain significantly reduced the ability of Chlamydia to infect host cells.

The researchers also found that Tarp's actin-binding domain is present in all Chlamydial species examined, despite the fact that the overall protein sequence of Tarp is highly variable between species. This suggests that the actin-binding domain is a critical component of Tarp's function. Furthermore, the study found that Tarp can polymerize actin independently of host cell factors, and that this process is distinct from the way actin is nucleated in eukaryotic cells.

The findings of this study indicate that Tarp-mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse Chlamydial species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells. The study suggests that targeting Tarp's actin-binding domain could be a potential strategy for developing new treatments for Chlamydia infections.
Researchers have developed a new method, called the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (FEA-SD) technique, to accurately quantify Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces. Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonotic disease that affects humans and animals, with water buffaloes being a significant reservoir host in China and the Philippines. The FEA-SD technique involves a series of steps, including filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation, to remove bulk debris and cellulose material from fecal samples. This allows for improved microscopic visualization of S. japonicum eggs, making it easier to determine the prevalence and intensity of infection in bovines and other ruminant hosts.

The FEA-SD technique was tested using fecal samples from naturally infected Chinese water buffaloes and carabao in the Philippines, and it was found to be as effective as real-time PCR (qPCR) in determining schistosome prevalence in bovines. However, the FEA-SD method is less costly to implement. This new technique can be used as a surveillance tool for animal reservoirs of S. japonicum, particularly in areas with low to high infection intensity or where there is suspected elimination of schistosomiasis japonica. The FEA-SD method is an improvement over existing microscopic methods, which are limited in terms of sensitivity due to the presence of bulk debris and cellulose material in bovine feces.
Researchers investigated the role of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) and cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) in the development of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder characterized by fragile bones. Mutations in the genes encoding P3H1 and CRTAP were previously identified as causes of recessive OI. P3H1 and CRTAP form a complex with cyclophilin B that 3-hydroxylates a specific proline residue on collagen and has chaperone activity. The researchers generated a mouse model with a mutation in the catalytic site of P3H1, which abolished its 3-hydroxylase activity but retained its ability to form a complex with CRTAP. The mice showed no significant over-modification of collagen, but had decreased trabecular bone mass and normal cartilage growth. This suggests that the loss of P3H1's 3-hydroxylase activity has different effects on bone and cartilage compared to the complete loss of the prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. The study highlights the importance of understanding the specific roles of P3H1 and CRTAP in collagen modification and bone development. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying OI and may lead to the development of targeted therapies for the disorder.
Researchers have discovered that the P-element, a selfish genetic element, has invaded the species Drosophila simulans, a close relative of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. This invasion has led to a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype, characterized by abnormal phenotypes and sterility, in the offspring of crosses between D. simulans strains collected in different years. A survey of 181 strains found that around 20% of them induce hybrid dysgenesis. Genomic and transcriptomic data revealed that this dysgenesis-inducing phenotype is associated with the invasion of the P-element.

The researchers surveyed 631 D. simulans strains collected on three continents and over 27 years for the presence of the P-element. They found that the invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously in the regions surveyed, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Strains collected from the latter phase of this invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element, as evidenced by their resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype.

Comparing the spread of the P-element in D. simulans to its spread in D. melanogaster, the researchers found that it occurred surprisingly fast in D. simulans. Both species have quickly evolved to suppress the dysgenesis phenotype by the end of the invasion, suggesting strong selection to ameliorate the P-element's worst effects.
Researchers have developed a new method to mark the bodies and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using a fluorescent dye called rhodamine B. This technique, called mark-release-recapture, allows scientists to track the movement and mating success of male mosquitoes in the wild. The method involves feeding male mosquitoes a sugar solution containing rhodamine B, which stains their bodies and seminal fluid. The researchers tested different concentrations of rhodamine B and found that 0.4% and 0.8% solutions produced the longest-lasting marks. They also found that the marking had no effect on the male mosquitoes' ability to mate with females. In field experiments, the researchers successfully transferred the marked seminal fluid to females and recaptured the marked males, demonstrating the effectiveness of the method. This technique could be used to evaluate the success of male-based methods for controlling Aedes aegypti populations, such as the sterile insect technique (SIT) and incompatible insect technique (IIT). The rhodamine B marking method is less expensive and time-consuming than other methods, such as PCR and stable isotope semen labeling, and does not have the negative side effects of traditional marking methods.
Researchers have discovered a new way that certain bacterial toxins, called superantigens, cause a severe inflammatory response in the body. This response can lead to a life-threatening condition called lethal shock. The toxins work by binding to a protein called CD28, which is found on the surface of immune cells called T cells. CD28 normally helps to activate the immune system, but in this case, it is hijacked by the superantigens to trigger a massive release of inflammatory chemicals.

The study found that the superantigens must bind directly to a specific part of the CD28 protein, called the dimer interface, in order to cause the inflammatory response. By blocking this binding site, the researchers were able to prevent the superantigens from causing lethal shock in mice. They also found that short peptides, or strings of amino acids, that mimic the CD28 dimer interface or compete with the superantigen for its binding site can protect mice from lethal superantigen exposure.

The researchers identified a specific region of the superantigen that is responsible for binding to CD28, and found that mutating this region abolished the ability of the superantigen to cause an inflammatory response. Structural analysis revealed that the superantigen can bind to the T cell receptor and the major histocompatibility complex on the surface of antigen-presenting cells, and that CD28 can fit into this complex as a third receptor, with its dimer interface oriented towards the superantigen.

Overall, the study reveals a new mechanism by which superantigens cause disease, and identifies CD28 as a critical receptor target for these toxins. This finding broadens our understanding of how the immune system recognizes and responds to pathogens.
Researchers have found that the Wnt/Tcf1 pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). ESCs have a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase, which is maintained by the lack of expression of cell cycle inhibitors. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway is known to control ESC pluripotency, but its effect on the cell cycle of ESCs was unknown. This study shows that the Wnt-effector Tcf1 is recruited to and activates the Ink4/Arf tumor suppressor locus, leading to the restoration of the G1 phase and reduced proliferation of ESCs without affecting their pluripotency. Tcf1, but not Tcf3, is responsible for this effect, and its recruitment to the promoter of cell cycle repressor genes such as p15Ink4b, p16Ink4a, and p19Arf mediates the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect in ESCs. The study also found that activation of the Wnt pathway downregulates some cell differentiation genes while maintaining the expression of pluripotency genes. The cell cycle effects are dependent on β-catenin and Tcf1 but independent of Tcf3, indicating specialized and non-overlapping functions of Tcf/Lef factors in ESCs.
Researchers studied how the dengue virus affects the immune system, specifically a type of immune cell called plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). They found that pDCs play a crucial role in fighting off the virus, particularly in mild cases of dengue fever. When pDCs are activated, they produce a protein called interferon-alpha (IFN-α), which helps to reduce the severity of the disease. The researchers also discovered that pDCs express a protein called TRAIL on their surface, which helps to kill infected cells.

In the study, the researchers analyzed blood samples from patients with mild and severe dengue fever, as well as from healthy individuals. They found that pDCs from patients with mild dengue fever had higher levels of TRAIL and IFN-α compared to those with severe dengue fever. The researchers also conducted experiments in a lab setting, where they exposed pDCs to the dengue virus and found that it triggered the production of TRAIL and IFN-α.

The study suggests that pDCs may play a key role in controlling the spread of the dengue virus and reducing the severity of the disease. The researchers propose that TRAIL-expressing pDCs may be an important factor in determining the outcome of dengue fever. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of pDCs in dengue fever, but the findings of this study provide new insights into the immune system's response to the virus.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and tuberculosis (TB) reactivation, particularly in the context of anti-TNF treatments. TNF plays a crucial role in host defense against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) in both active and latent phases of infection. However, TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been linked to an increased risk of TB reactivation. This study used a computational approach to analyze the effects of anti-TNF therapy on TB reactivation rates. The researchers simulated two commonly used anti-TNF treatments, a TNF-neutralizing antibody and a soluble TNF receptor fusion, in virtual clinical trials. They found that the bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor contributing to TB reactivation. Additionally, they discovered that even low levels of soluble TNF (sTNF) are essential for controlling Mtb infection. The study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed to balance the need to reduce inflammation with the need to maintain resistance to infection. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified to minimize the risk of TB reactivation. The findings also indicate that anti-TNF therapy may lead to an increased risk of primary TB in areas where exposure to Mtb is common.
A recent study investigated inter-population differences in the loss and expression of retrogenes in humans. Researchers used data from the 1000 Genomes Project and the Illumina BodyMap project to analyze the variation in retrocopy loss among different human populations. They also developed a new approach to detect novel retrocopies absent from the reference human genome. The study identified 193 retroduplication variations (RDVs), the majority of which resulted from retrocopy deletion. Most of these RDVs had not been previously reported. The researchers experimentally confirmed the existence of the detected retrocopies and determined their presence or absence in the human genomes of 17 different populations. They also found that 11 ancestral retrogenes that underwent deletion in certain individuals were expressed, suggesting some functionality. Additionally, the study found 9 retrogenes that underwent statistically significant differential expression between populations. The researchers suggest that retrocopy polymorphisms can provide insight into ongoing evolutionary processes and may serve as markers for human population history.
Researchers studied how the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain affects the body's inflammatory response when treated with the antiparasitic drug praziquantel. They analyzed brain tissue from 11 pigs naturally infected with the parasite and found that cysticerci located in the brain's parenchyma (the main tissue of the brain) caused a stronger inflammatory response after treatment compared to those in the meninges (the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) or in both locations. In fact, the inflammatory response to cysticerci in the meninges was significantly decreased compared to those in the parenchyma. The study also found that the disruption of the blood-brain barrier, which allows substances to pass from the bloodstream into the brain, was associated with treatment only in the parenchymal tissue. The researchers suggest that the suboptimal inflammatory response to cysticidal drugs may be the reason why subarachnoid neurocysticercosis (a condition where cysticerci are located in the space surrounding the brain and spinal cord) is generally resistant to treatment compared to parenchymal neurocysticercosis (where cysticerci are located in the brain tissue). This study provides new insights into the complex relationship between the location of Taenia solium cysticerci and the body's inflammatory response to treatment, which could lead to improved treatment strategies for neurocysticercosis.
Researchers conducted a study in Ghana to investigate the presence of yaws, a bacterial infection caused by Treponema pallidum ssp. pertenue, in two districts that had previously received mass drug administration (MDA) of azithromycin for trachoma control. The study aimed to determine if resistance to azithromycin had developed in T. pallidum ssp. pertenue or if alternative infections were causing reported cases of yaws. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 30 communities in the two districts, where children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled. Samples were collected for treponemal serology, lesion PCR, and syphilis serology.

The results showed that all children had negative treponemal and non-treponemal serology, indicating they had never been infected with yaws. PCR for T. pallidum ssp. pertenue was negative in all children, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. The study found no evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws in the communities. However, H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, and the majority of lesions remained unexplained. The study suggests that integration of diagnostic testing into pre- and post-MDA surveillance systems is necessary to better inform yaws control programs. The findings have implications for the World Health Organization's yaws eradication campaign, as Ghana is a major focus of yaws worldwide.
Researchers have been searching for ways to eliminate the reservoir of HIV-infected cells that persists in the body even when antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses the virus. This reservoir is made up of memory T cells, which are a type of immune cell that remembers past infections and can reactivate the virus. A key driver of HIV persistence is the Jak-STAT signaling pathway, which is triggered by cytokines that regulate T cell homeostasis. Two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxolitinib, were tested in the lab to see if they could block the seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir. The results showed that these inhibitors reduced the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA and blocked viral production from infected cells. They also prevented the transmission of infectious particles to bystander activated T cells. The study found that dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence in the body, and that Jak inhibitors target key events downstream of cytokine ligation to their receptors, impacting the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in all memory CD4 T cell subsets. These findings suggest that Jak inhibitors could be a therapeutic modality to prevent key events of T cell activation that regulate HIV persistence, and may be integrated into future curative strategies.
Researchers studied the response of Spodoptera exigua larvae to infection with two types of baculoviruses, SeMNPV and AcMNPV. Contrary to the expected shutdown of host gene expression, the larvae showed a balanced mix of up- and down-regulated genes in the first 36 hours after infection. Many immune-related genes were found to be down-regulated, including those involved in pattern recognition, signaling, and immune pathways. This down-regulation was also observed in the larval gut, where immune-related genes play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of gut microorganisms.

The researchers hypothesized that the down-regulation of immune-related genes might lead to an increase in gut microbiota. Indeed, they found an increase in bacterial load in the gut of infected larvae. Further experiments revealed that the presence of gut bacteria enhanced the virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion of the baculovirus. This suggests that the down-regulation of immune-related genes in the gut may provide an advantage to the virus, allowing it to infect the host more effectively.

The study highlights the complex relationship between the host immune response and the gut microbiota in the context of viral infection. The findings suggest that the role of gut microbiota cannot be ignored when studying virus infection, and that baculoviruses may manipulate host immune responses to their advantage.
Scientists have discovered a way to turn meiosis, a type of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes, into mitosis, a type of cell division that maintains the same number of chromosomes. This breakthrough could lead to the development of apomixis, a process where plants can reproduce asexually through seeds, without the need for fertilization. Apomixis is of great interest in agriculture, as it would allow farmers to produce seeds that are genetically identical to the parent plant, reducing the need for fertilization and increasing crop yields.

Researchers isolated a gene that controls the entry into the second meiotic division and combined it with two other genes that affect key meiotic processes to create a new genotype called MiMe. In MiMe plants, meiosis is replaced by mitosis, resulting in the production of functional diploid gametes that are genetically identical to the mother plant. This is a significant step towards understanding and engineering apomixis.

The researchers found that MiMe plants undergo a mitotic-like division instead of a normal meiotic division, without affecting subsequent sexual processes. When meiosis is replaced by mitosis, ploidy is expected to double with each generation. The MiMe genotype produces quasi-wild type levels of viable and apomeiotic ovules and pollen grains, making it a promising candidate for apomixis engineering.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the identification of genes that cause diseases by taking into account the specific tissues affected by the disease. Current methods use a general network of protein interactions to prioritize genes, but this approach has limitations. The new method integrates tissue-specific gene expression data with protein-protein interaction information to create tissue-specific networks for 60 different human tissues. By using these tissue-specific networks, the researchers found that the accuracy of gene prioritization improved significantly compared to using a general network. The method also allowed for the prediction of new disease-tissue associations that may not have been detected early on.

The researchers tested the method by applying it to various diseases and found that the tissue-specific approach outperformed the general approach in most cases. They also used the method to infer new disease-causing genes and found that a large majority of known disease-causing genes are expressed in the corresponding disease-associated tissue. The researchers used two different methods to construct tissue-specific protein-protein interaction networks and found that both methods improved the performance of the gene prioritization algorithm. Overall, the new method has the potential to improve the identification of disease-causing genes and provide new insights into the underlying biology of diseases. By taking into account the specific tissues affected by a disease, the method can help researchers to better understand the molecular mechanisms of diseases and develop more effective treatments.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model to study the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes that transmit diseases such as malaria. The two-locus model takes into account the different exposure levels of male and female mosquitoes to insecticides, as well as the varying effectiveness of the insecticides and the genetic makeup of the mosquito population. The model was used to investigate the effectiveness of two strategies for minimizing the spread of resistance: deploying insecticides in sequence and using a mixture of two insecticides.

The study found that both strategies can be effective in delaying the spread of resistance, but the best approach depends on the characteristics of the insecticides and the mosquito population. Mixtures of insecticides were found to be more effective when the insecticides are highly effective and the mosquitoes have low exposure to the insecticides. However, if the insecticides do not reliably kill susceptible mosquitoes, sequential deployment may be a more robust strategy. The study also found that using a mixture of insecticides can slow the spread of resistance, but may not always outperform sequential use.

The researchers emphasize that their model is a tool for designing and implementing effective vector control strategies, rather than a recommendation for a specific policy. They suggest that the use of mixtures or sequential deployment should be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specific characteristics of the insecticides and the mosquito population. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the genetic and behavioral factors that influence the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes.
Researchers studied the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a type of kissing bug that transmits Chagas disease. They used next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins present in the saliva. The analysis revealed 636 protein-coding DNA sequences, 73 of which were confirmed by proteomic analysis. The study found that the saliva of R. neglectus contains various protein families, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5, which are also found in other hematophagous insects. However, metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding proteins were less abundant.

The researchers also detected serine protease transcripts in the saliva of R. neglectus, which was a notable finding. Despite the high number of transcripts, only one serine protease was detected by proteomic analysis. The study suggests that the expression of serine proteases in the saliva of R. neglectus may be related to the type of blood it feeds on. The research provides new insights into the sialome of R. neglectus and contributes to the understanding of the complex interactions between hematophagous arthropods and their vertebrate hosts. The study highlights the importance of further research on the sialome of R. neglectus and other triatomine species to better understand the mechanisms of Chagas disease transmission.
Researchers used the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans to study how it responds to different types of bacteria found in grassland soils. They used a technique called transcriptional profiling to identify genes that are turned on or off in response to different bacteria. The goal was to see if these genes are important for the worm's survival and fitness in its environment.

The researchers found that many of the genes that were turned on or off in response to different bacteria are involved in metabolism and the worm's immune system. They then used genetic mutations to turn off these genes one by one and measured how it affected the worm's lifespan and fitness in different bacterial environments. They found that most of the genes they studied had a significant impact on the worm's survival and fitness in its environment.

The researchers also used statistical analysis to see if the degree to which a gene was turned on or off in response to different bacteria predicted how much of an impact its loss would have on the worm's survival and fitness. They found that this was often the case, suggesting that the genes that are turned on or off in response to different bacteria are indeed important for the worm's survival and fitness in its environment.

This study provides new insights into how nematode worms interact with bacteria in their environment and how these interactions can affect their survival and fitness. The findings have implications for understanding how changes in the environment, such as land use change, can impact nematode populations and ecosystems.
Researchers have found that random fluctuations in gene expression, known as noise, play a crucial role in the early development of mammalian embryos. Specifically, they investigated the formation of the inner cell mass (ICM) surrounded by the trophoectoderm (TE), a shell of cells that later forms extraembryonic structures. Using multi-scale, stochastic modeling, they discovered that noise in gene expression promotes cell plasticity and helps accurately organize the developing mouse blastocyst.

The study made three key predictions, which were supported by quantitative imaging. First, stochasticity in the expression of critical genes is essential for organizing the blastocyst. Second, asymmetry in the levels of noise variation between Cdx2 and Oct4 provides a means to balance the benefits of noise-mediated plasticity with the potential drawbacks of stochasticity. Third, the embryo temporally modulates plasticity by controlling the timing and pace of cell fate specification, creating a time window for cells to adjust their fate based on their environment.

The results suggest that noise has a crucial role in maintaining cellular plasticity and organizing the blastocyst. The researchers found that noise in Cdx2 expression improves organization, while noise in Oct4 expression does not. They also found that the amount of expression noise within embryos is consistent with the amounts required to promote proper organization. Overall, the study highlights the importance of noise in the early development of mammalian embryos and suggests that it plays a critical role in ensuring the correct structural arrangement of the blastocyst.
Researchers have discovered that human germline antibody gene segments can encode antibodies with the ability to bind to multiple, diverse antigens. This property, known as polyspecificity, is typically acquired through somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells, which increase the binding affinity and specificity of the antibody for a particular epitope. However, a team of scientists used computational design to investigate whether germline gene-encoded antibodies are optimal for polyspecificity. They used the Rosetta multi-state design process to predict antibody sequences that could engage multiple antigens at once. The results showed that the predicted sequences matched the germline gene sequences to a remarkable degree, revealing the residues that enable polyspecificity.

The study found that key positions in the VH gene encoding CDR1, CDR2, and the immunoglobulin framework are critical contributors to polyspecificity in germline antibodies. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned sequences similar to the mature antibody sequence, mimicking natural antibody maturation. The researchers demonstrated that the Rosetta computational design algorithm captures important aspects of antibody/antigen recognition. The study suggests that computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow for the rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecificity for diverse epitope binding. This could have significant implications for the development of new therapeutic antibodies.
Researchers have studied the behavior of locusts to understand how they transition from a solitary phase to a gregarious phase, where they form large aggregations that can lead to destructive outbreaks. A mathematical model was developed to describe the dynamics of this phase change at the collective level. The model incorporates the interplay between individual-level phase change and spatial movement to predict the formation of hopper bands at the population level. Stability analysis of the model revealed conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large-scale transition to the gregarious phase. The model also enabled the quantification of the temporal dynamics of each phase, the proportion of the population that will eventually gregarize, and the time scale for this to occur. Numerical simulations provided descriptions of the aggregation's structure and revealed transiently traveling clumps of gregarious insects. The study found that in the limit of low densities, both phases are uniformly spread and the solitarious phase dominates. However, for sufficiently large populations, a dense, traveling patch of gregarious locusts suddenly emerges, while solitarious locusts become more scarce. The critical density beyond which the gregarious group forms was calculated, as well as the final ratio of gregarious to solitarious locusts. The study also identified locust clustering at high densities with the onset of a hopper band.
Researchers have long sought to understand the complex process of viral membrane fusion, a crucial step in the life cycle of many viruses. Flaviviruses, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus, use a class II viral fusion protein called E to mediate fusion at acidic pH. However, capturing the intermediate structures of this process has been challenging due to their transient nature. By exposing flavivirus particles to alkaline pH instead of acidic, scientists were able to trap the virus in an intermediate conformation. In this state, the E dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide, but do not proceed to merge the membranes. Further treatment with low pH leads to fusion, suggesting that these monomers represent a previously elusive intermediate required to convert the prefusion dimer into the postfusion trimer. This finding provides new insights into the dynamic process of viral membrane fusion, revealing two separate steps: membrane insertion of multiple copies of E monomers, followed by the formation of hairpin-like trimers. The use of non-physiological conditions allowed researchers to dissect the flavivirus fusion process and identify these intermediate structures, shedding light on the complex mechanisms of viral membrane fusion.
A recent study examined the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot. The researchers compared Red List data for the British and South African floras and found that the taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between regions, contradicting a simple, trait-based model of extinction. Using a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape, the study revealed a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant extinction risks, but found that the most threatened species cluster within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals.

The study analyzed the distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades and suggested that mode of speciation best explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. The researchers found that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. Critically, the most vulnerable plant species are marching towards extinction at a more rapid pace, but independently from anthropogenic effects.

The study's results have important implications for conservation priorities and cast doubts on the utility of current Red List criteria for plants in regions such as the Cape, where speciation has been rapid. The findings also suggest that species turnover (speciation and extinction) might be rapid generally for plants, and high extinction rates may not be unusual over evolutionary timescales. The study highlights the need for detailed knowledge of interspecific phylogenetic relationships within higher taxa to estimate the true impact of plant extinctions on the loss of evolutionary history across the angiosperm tree-of-life.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav1, that play a crucial role in the immune system's ability to fight off the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. Candida albicans is an opportunistic fungus that can cause infections in people with weakened immune systems. The researchers found that BTK and Vav1 work together with a protein called Dectin-1 to help macrophages, a type of immune cell, engulf and destroy Candida albicans. This process is called phagocytosis.

The study showed that BTK and Vav1 are recruited to the phagocytic cup, a structure that forms around the fungus as it is being engulfed by the macrophage. BTK and Vav1 help to activate a signaling pathway that leads to the formation of a molecule called PI(3,4,5)P3, which is essential for phagocytosis. Without BTK and Vav1, macrophages have difficulty engulfing and destroying Candida albicans, making them more susceptible to infection.

The researchers used a selective BTK inhibitor to block the activity of BTK and found that it impaired the ability of macrophages to engulf Candida albicans. They also found that mice lacking BTK or Vav1 were more susceptible to systemic Candida albicans infection. These findings suggest that BTK and Vav1 play a critical role in the immune system's ability to fight off Candida albicans infections.
Researchers conducted a study in Madagascar to understand the risks and mechanisms of transmission of Rift Valley Fever (RVF), a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans. The study aimed to identify environmental factors and areas favorable to RVF transmission to both cattle and humans, as well as human behaviors that contribute to human infections. The researchers used a combination of environmental, cattle, and human serological data to analyze the factors associated with RVF transmission.

The study found that humid environments and high cattle density were positively associated with RVF transmission in both cattle and humans. The analysis also showed that frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection. The researchers identified the eastern-coast, western, and north-western parts of Madagascar as high-risk areas for RVF transmission in cattle. The study suggests that concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintaining RVF enzootic transmission in these areas.

The study's integrated approach provided new insights into RVF transmission patterns in Madagascar, highlighting the importance of considering both environmental and human factors in understanding the disease's spread. The findings suggest that vectorial transmission is likely to occur in the at-risk humid environments of the western, north-western, and eastern-coast areas, where Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes are present. Further research is needed to assess the relative contribution of vectorial and direct transmissions to RVF transmission in these areas.
Researchers have identified a distinct type of transmission barrier in prions, which are self-propagating protein conformations. Prions can be transmitted between non-identical proteins, but this process is often inefficient. The study used a yeast Rnq1/[PIN+]-based system to explore the nature of transmission barriers. The prion domain of Rnq1 carries four discrete QN-rich regions, which can independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the [PIN+] prion state in vivo. Analysis of [PIN+] transmission between Rnq1 fragments with different sets of prion determinants revealed that one common QN-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission. However, transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength, even when the sequences of the common QNs are identical. This suggests that multiple prion determinants act cooperatively to attain the final prion conformation, and transmission barriers are determined by this cooperative fold. The study found that the [PIN+] prion domain is located in the QN-rich C-terminus of Rnq1, but no single QN region is essential for maintaining the prion state. Instead, multiple determinants in the prion domain can independently support the prion state.
Researchers have developed a new method for analyzing genetic data using deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence. This approach, called deep learning for population genetic inference, allows for the analysis of complex population genetic models without the need for likelihood calculations. The method uses a neural network to learn a feature-based function that maps input data, such as summary statistics, to output parameters, such as population genetic parameters. The researchers applied this method to a dataset of 197 African Drosophila melanogaster genomes from Zambia and found that it was effective in distinguishing between regions of the genome that have undergone natural selection and those that have not. They also found that soft sweeps and balancing selection occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. Additionally, the demographic inference suggested that previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosophila melanogaster are too extreme. This new method has the potential to provide a complimentary approach to existing likelihood-free inference methods in population genetics and could be used to classify regions as neutral or selected for subsequent demographic inference. The researchers also suggest that this method could be applied to a wider variety of scenarios in population genetics, such as selecting optimal statistics for Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) or other methods.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes, such as E6 and E7, play a crucial role in the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. Research has shown that cells expressing these oncogenes are hypersensitive to the DNA crosslinking agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). The study found that HPV oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway, which is responsible for repairing ICLs. Although E6/E7 activated the FA pathway by increasing FancD2 monoubiquitination and foci formation, they inhibited the completion of the repair process by multiple mechanisms. Specifically, E6/E7 impaired the colocalization of FancD2 with double-strand breaks (DSBs), hindering the recruitment of the downstream protein Rad51 to DSBs. Additionally, E6 expression caused delayed FancD2 de-ubiquitination, a critical process for effective ICL repair. This delay was associated with increased chromatin retention of FancD2, which hindered the activity of the de-ubiquitinating enzyme USP1 and activated the ATR/CHK-1/pS565 FancI signaling pathway. Furthermore, E6 reduced the expression and foci formation of Palb2, a repair protein downstream of FancD2. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and the response to cisplatin therapies.
Researchers have made significant progress in controlling onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus, in the Southern Chiapas focus in Mexico. Since 1998, all 559 endemic communities in the area have received semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin, a medication that kills the parasite. In 2003, the treatment frequency was increased to four times a year in 50 communities, and in 2009, an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly treatment regimen. The goal of the Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas is to eliminate new ocular morbidity caused by the infection and eventually eliminate transmission of the parasite in all 13 foci in Latin America.

To assess the effectiveness of the treatment, researchers conducted in-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessments in six sentinel communities that received two rounds of ivermectin treatment per year and three extra-sentinel communities that received four rounds of ivermectin treatment per year. The results showed that none of the 67,924 black flies collected from the area during the dry season of 2011 contained parasite DNA, indicating a very low infective rate of 0.06 per 2,000 flies. Additionally, serological assays testing for Onchocerca volvulus exposure in 4,230 children under the age of 5 revealed that only 2 individuals (0.05%) were exposed to the parasite. These findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission developed by the international community, indicating that the transmission of Onchocerca volvulus has been interrupted in the Southern Chiapas focus.
Researchers have identified a small peptide pheromone, pPplA, secreted by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes that enhances its ability to escape from host cell vacuoles. Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogen that invades mammalian cells and replicates within the host cell cytosol. The researchers found that the pPplA pheromone is generated through the proteolytic processing of the PplA lipoprotein secretion signal peptide. They discovered that bacteria lacking the pPplA pheromone are significantly attenuated for virulence in mice and have a reduced efficiency of bacterial escape from the vacuoles of non-professional phagocytic cells. Mutational activation of the PrfA transcriptional activator, which regulates gene products required for intracellular bacterial growth and spread, restores virulence and eliminates the need for pPplA-dependent signaling. The researchers propose that the pPplA peptide may signal to Listeria monocytogenes its presence within the host cell vacuole, stimulating the expression of gene products that contribute to vacuole escape and facilitating PrfA activation to promote bacterial growth within the cytosol. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms of Listeria monocytogenes pathogenesis and highlights the importance of peptide pheromones in bacterial communication and virulence.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera, adapts to the hostile environment inside a host's small intestine. They found that the bacteria use a strategy called hypermutation to overcome the oxidative stress caused by the host's immune system. Oxidative stress is a type of damage caused by free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can harm cells.

The researchers used a technique called Tn-seq to identify the genes involved in Vibrio cholerae's ability to resist oxidative stress. They compared the bacteria's ability to colonize the intestines of mice with and without an antioxidant treatment that reduces oxidative stress. They found that bacteria with a mutation in the mutS gene, which is part of the DNA repair system, were more likely to colonize the intestines of mice with high levels of oxidative stress.

However, when the mice were treated with the antioxidant, the bacteria with the mutS mutation were not more likely to colonize the intestines. The researchers also found that the bacteria with the mutS mutation were more likely to produce catalase, an enzyme that breaks down free radicals. They also found that some bacteria with the mutS mutation could revert back to their normal form when grown in a lab dish.

The study suggests that Vibrio cholerae uses hypermutation as a temporary strategy to adapt to the oxidative stress caused by the host's immune system. The researchers also found that the mutation rate of the bacteria was higher in mice with high levels of oxidative stress than in mice with low levels of oxidative stress.
Researchers studied the role of Mlh1-Mlh3, a protein complex involved in meiosis and DNA repair, in baker's yeast. They analyzed 60 new mutations in the mlh3 gene and found five that specifically disrupted DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and one that specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. The researchers purified and characterized the Mlh1-Mlh3 complexes from these mutants and found that they retained wild-type endonuclease activity in vitro. However, one mutant, Mlh1-mlh3-45, was defective in interacting with the MMR component Msh2-Msh3, while another mutant, Mlh1-mlh3-32, was likely defective in interacting with meiosis-specific factors. Whole-genome recombination maps revealed that all mlh3 mutants showed an increase in non-crossover events, suggesting that recombination intermediates were resolved through alternative pathways. The study provides a structure-function map for Mlh3 and highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions in regulating Mlh1-Mlh3's enzymatic activity. The findings also demonstrate how defective meiotic components can alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing new insights into the regulation of meiotic recombination pathways. The study's results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of meiotic recombination and the consequences of defects in meiotic components.
Researchers have found that the structure of a host population can hinder the reversal of antibiotic resistance after treatment is stopped. When antibiotics are used intensively to treat diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, and gonorrhea, resistance levels in the pathogen population increase rapidly. This often leads to the discontinuation of older drugs and a switch to new ones. However, resistance can persist or decline slowly even after treatment is stopped. The study suggests that the structure of the host population, particularly the heterogeneity in the number of contacts between individuals, plays a significant role in the reversion dynamics. This heterogeneity affects the distribution of the resistant strain among the infected population during treatment and influences the competition dynamics after treatment is stopped, leading to a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability of reversion to sensitivity on the population level. Simulations showed that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is greatest when the fitness costs of resistance are small, which is a common scenario for many pathogen-drug combinations. The study's framework can be used to study the emergence of resistance during treatment and the subsequent competition dynamics between resistant and sensitive strains after treatment is discontinued.
Researchers studied the genetic factors contributing to autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by examining the interactions between genes affected by copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with autism. They used Drosophila (fruit flies) as a model organism to study the effects of gene dosage changes on neurological phenotypes. The study focused on genes that had previously been linked to ASD and were affected by CNVs in individuals with the disorder. The researchers found that altering the dosage of these genes in Drosophila resulted in neurological defects similar to those previously reported in Drosophila models of ASD.

The study also investigated the interactions between pairs of genes affected by the same CNV. In three out of four cases, the researchers observed significant synergistic effects when the dosage of both genes was changed simultaneously. This suggests that the combined effect of multiple genes may contribute to the development of ASD. The study found that different interactions affected different synaptic processes, indicating distinct molecular mechanisms underlying the disorder.

The results support the idea that large structural variations, such as CNVs, can contribute to the development of ASD through synergistic effects. This study provides new insights into the genetic causes of ASD and highlights the importance of considering the interactions between multiple genes in understanding the disorder. The findings have implications for the development of new treatments and therapies for ASD.
Researchers have long known that CD8+ T cells play a significant role in the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) in mice infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. However, the mechanisms behind their pathogenic activity during malaria infection were not well understood. A recent study used advanced microscopy and flow cytometry techniques to investigate the behavior of CD8+ T cells in the brains of mice infected with both ECM-inducing and non-inducing strains of Plasmodium berghei.

The study found that CD8+ T cells accumulated in the perivascular spaces of the brain in both types of infections. However, in ECM-inducing infections, these T cells displayed an "arrested" behavior, as if they were forming long-term interactions with other cells. This behavior was not seen in non-inducing infections. The researchers also observed that CD8+ T cells interacted with antigen-presenting cells in the brain during ECM-inducing infections, but this interaction did not prevent the development of ECM.

The study also found that CD8+ T cells colocalized with rare apoptotic cells in the brain during ECM-inducing infections. However, apoptosis was a rare event and did not contribute to the disruption of the brain's blood vessels. The researchers concluded that the arrest of CD8+ T cells in the perivascular compartments of the brain is a unique feature of ECM-inducing malaria infections and may play a key role in the development of the ECM syndrome.
Researchers conducted a study in Vihiga County, Kenya to determine the prevalence and potential risk factors of tungiasis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans. A total of 437 participants, aged 5 and above, were clinically examined for the presence of tungiasis in 21 villages across three sub-locations. The overall prevalence of tungiasis was found to be 21.5%, with the highest concentration of cases in Chambiti and Selelwe villages.

The study identified several factors associated with the occurrence of tungiasis, including low economic status, earthen floors, lack of toilet facilities, age under 14, and not wearing closed footwear regularly. The researchers used geographic information systems (GIS) to map the geographic distribution of tungiasis in the area and found no spatial autocorrelation, suggesting that the prevalence of the disease may be random.

The study highlights the importance of tungiasis as a public health problem in Vihiga County, particularly among communities living in poverty. The findings suggest that control strategies for tungiasis should be designed to be cost-effective and accessible to the affected communities. The study's results also emphasize the need for further research on the geographical distribution and burden of tungiasis to better understand the scope of the disease.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how hormones, specifically auxin and cytokinin, regulate vascular patterning in the Arabidopsis root tip. The model shows that an auxin maximum forms along the xylem axis due to mutual feedback between auxin and cytokinin, mediated by the PIN class of auxin efflux transporters and AHP6, an inhibitor of cytokinin signalling. The model reveals that an informative spatial pattern in cytokinin levels is unlikely and not required for correct auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response allow for the necessary feedbacks, which can amplify and stabilize the auxin maximum. The model also predicts and experimentally verifies a role of AUX1 and LAX1/2 auxin influx transporters in vascular patterning. Polar localization of PIN1 generates an auxin flux circuit that stabilizes the accumulation of auxin within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate specifically in the xylem-pole pericycle cells, an important early step in lateral root initiation. The model also shows that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with the observation that lateral roots are not initiated opposite to each other. The study highlights the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for pattern robustness and provides insights into the dynamics of transverse auxin transport, which will be essential for constructing three-dimensional models of auxin transport and root growth in Arabidopsis.
Researchers have discovered a key player in the migratory locust's ability to change its behavior in response to its environment. The study found that a protein called CREB-B acts as a mediator in a signaling pathway that involves the neuropeptide F (NPF) and nitric oxide (NO). This pathway is crucial for the locust's ability to switch between solitary and gregarious phases, which affects its locomotor activity.

The researchers found that CREB-B directly activates the expression of the NOS gene, which is involved in the production of NO. They also discovered that the phosphorylation of CREB-B at a specific site changes in response to changes in population density. This phosphorylation is negatively controlled by NPF2, a neuropeptide that modulates phase-related locomotor activity.

The study used RNAi experiments and behavioral assays to validate the role of CREB-B in NPF2-regulated locomotor plasticity. They also found that protein kinase A (PKA) mediates the regulatory effects of NPF2 on CREB-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription.

The findings highlight a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity in migratory locusts. The study suggests that the NPF/NO signaling pathway, which involves CREB-B and PKA, may be a common mechanism underlying behavioral plasticity in animals.
Researchers studied the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (ZLD) in the early development of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). They used a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq) to map regions bound by ZLD in embryos at different stages of development. The study focused on the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), a period when the zygotic genome is activated after fertilization.

The results showed that ZLD binds to thousands of regions in the genome before the MZT, including the promoters and enhancers of genes that are transcribed early in development. However, ZLD also binds to the promoters of genes that are not transcribed until the MZT. This suggests that ZLD plays a role not only in the earliest wave of transcription but also in activating the genome at the MZT.

The researchers found that ZLD binding can be used to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. They also observed that the association between early ZLD binding and MZT activity is strong, indicating that ZLD may play a central role in regulating genome activity at the MZT. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ZLD activation and its role in early development.
Researchers have identified 109 new interactions between proteins that play a crucial role in the body's internal clock, which regulates various physiological processes over a 24-hour cycle. These interactions, known as protein-protein interactions (PPIs), are essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock. The study used a yeast-two-hybrid approach to identify these interactions and found that one interaction, between protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1, leads to the destabilization of BMAL1. A dynamic circadian PPI network was constructed using circadian expression data, which predicted the timing of these interactions. Systematic analysis of the network revealed that interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, suggesting that regulatory interactions are restricted to specific phases of the circadian cycle. The study also found that these PPIs connect many important cellular processes, such as signal transduction and cell cycle regulation, contributing to the temporal organization of cellular physiology. This research provides a systems-wide view of circadian PPI dynamics and highlights the importance of precisely timed interactions for the proper functioning of the circadian clock. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how the body's internal clock regulates various physiological processes and may lead to new insights into the treatment of circadian-related disorders.
Researchers have determined the three-dimensional structure of a repeating unit of the ABA-1 nematode polyprotein allergen from Ascaris suum, a parasitic worm that infects pigs. This protein, called ABA-1A, is part of a family of proteins called nematode polyprotein allergens (NPAs) that are found only in nematodes. NPAs are unusual proteins that bind to lipids and are thought to play a key role in the transport and distribution of small hydrophobic compounds within nematodes. They may also be involved in nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and the immune response to infection.

The researchers used a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to determine the structure of ABA-1A. They found that it has a novel seven-helical fold, with a long central helix surrounded by two four-helical bundles. The protein has two distinct lipid-binding sites, one at the N-terminus and one at the C-terminus. The researchers also found that one of the binding sites is occupied by a ligand, likely a fatty acid, that is tightly bound to the protein.

The discovery of the structure of ABA-1A provides new insights into the biology of NPAs and their role in nematode infections. NPAs are of interest as potential targets for drug or immunological intervention, as they have no counterparts in vertebrates. The researchers suggest that understanding the structure and function of NPAs could lead to new ways to combat nematode infections, which are a major public health problem in many parts of the world.
Ciguatera fish poisoning is a significant public health concern in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), with a reported 39,677 cases from 17 PICTs between 1998 and 2008. The mean annual incidence of ciguatera was 194 cases per 100,000 people, a 60% increase from the reported annual incidence of 104 cases per 100,000 between 1973 and 1983. Taking into account under-reporting, an estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from ciguatera over the last 35 years. Ciguatera is caused by consuming coral reef fish contaminated with ciguatoxin, which can lead to acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, as well as chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months. The disease is often under-diagnosed and under-reported, with only 2-10% of cases reported to health authorities. Ciguatera is a prevalent tropical and subtropical disease that has been an under-appreciated cause of acute and chronic disease in island communities. The incidence of ciguatera is predicted to continue to increase due to changes in global climate patterns, coastal marine environment degradation, and increased exploitation of coastal marine resources. A well-funded multidisciplinary research team is needed to translate research advances into practical management solutions to address this significant public health problem.
Researchers studied the impact of benznidazole treatment on the immune response of CD4+CD8+ T cells in patients with chronic Chagas disease. Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. The study found that CD4+CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell, were more common in patients with chronic Chagas disease than in healthy individuals. These cells also expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors, which can weaken the immune response, in proportion to the severity of the disease. Benznidazole treatment reduced the number of CD4+CD8+ T cells and decreased the expression of inhibitory receptors. This improvement in the immune response was associated with an increase in the production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules by CD4+CD8+ T cells, which are essential for fighting the parasite. The study suggests that CD4+CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in controlling T. cruzi infection and that benznidazole treatment can partially reverse the exhaustion of these cells, leading to an improved immune response. The findings provide new insights into the immune response against T. cruzi infection and may help in evaluating the effectiveness of benznidazole treatment in patients with chronic Chagas disease.
Researchers have identified Arabidopsis thaliana phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C2 (AtPLC2) as a primary enzyme in the phosphoinositide metabolic pathway. Phosphoinositides play a crucial role in plant development and stress response, but previous studies have been hindered by the complexity of the pathway due to multiple isoforms of phosphoinositide biosynthetic genes. By analyzing knockout mutants of multiple AtPLC isoforms, the researchers found that AtPLC2 is the primary phospholipase in phosphoinositide metabolism. This enzyme is involved in seedling growth and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response in Arabidopsis.

Lipidomic profiling of the plc2-1 mutant showed increased levels of its substrates, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating that the major phosphoinositide metabolic pathway is impaired. AtPLC2 was found to have a distinct tissue expression pattern and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types, where phosphoinositide signaling occurs. The seedlings of the plc2-1 mutant showed growth defects that were complemented by heterologous expression of AtPLC2, suggesting that phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C activity borne by AtPLC2 is required for seedling growth.

Furthermore, the plc2-1 mutant showed hypersensitive response to ER stress, as evidenced by changes in relevant phenotypes and gene expression profiles. These findings reveal the primary enzyme in phosphoinositide metabolism, its involvement in seedling growth, and an emerging link between phosphoinositide and the ER stress response.
The article challenges the reductionist assumption that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. A principled measure of intrinsic cause-effect power, integrated information (Φ), is employed to evaluate the causal power of systems across different spatial and temporal scales. By considering all possible black boxes, which are macro elements consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates, it is shown that a macro level can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements. This reveals the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a result, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which local maxima of Φ are identified during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus. The results refute the reductionist assumption that causal power resides exclusively at the micro level and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.
Researchers have investigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC), which plays a crucial role in cellular adaptation to environmental changes and can also cause cell damage under certain conditions. To better understand the mechanisms behind ROS production, a rule-based model of complex III in the RC was extended to account for electron transport, proton translocation, and other processes. The model was validated by fitting it to experimental data from rat brain mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate, and it accurately predicted the dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse electron transport from succinate through complex I.

The analysis revealed that ROS production is associated with the levels of specific radicals in individual electron transporters and their combinations in complexes I and III. It was also found that the phenomenon of bistability, previously observed in complex III, remains valid for the whole RC. The conditions for switching to a state with a high content of free radicals in complex III were predicted and confirmed experimentally. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ROS production in the RC and suggests that the phenomenon of bistability plays a crucial role in this process.
Researchers have studied how motor proteins, which convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, facilitate intracellular transport in eukaryotic cells. These proteins work in teams to transport cargo over long distances in a unidirectional or bidirectional manner. Disruptions in the transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations that alter single motor characteristics, can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. A recent study found that phosphorylation of the kinesin motor domain at a specific serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, resulting in lowered single motor stalling forces.

A new study has investigated the effects of mutations on the transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. The results show that mutants with altered stall forces can determine the average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered by wild-type motors in the ensemble. The study also found that mutants gain a competitive advantage and lead to an increase in the expected run-length when the load on the cargo is near the mutant's stalling force or a multiple of its stalling force.

The researchers developed a semi-analytical method to analyze the transport of cargo by multiple motors of multiple types. This technique determines transition rates between various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo, enabling the computation of biologically relevant quantities such as average velocity and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. The method can also be used to introduce alterations of single motor parameters to model a mutation and deduce its effects on the transport of a common cargo by multiple motors.
Researchers studied how a specific gene, CACNA1C, affects learning in mice. They used a task called operant cue discrimination, where mice had to learn to perform a specific action based on a visual cue. The researchers found that mice without the CACNA1C gene, which is associated with severe learning deficits and psychiatric disorders, still learned the task but used a different strategy than mice with the gene. The CACNA1C knockout mice increased their reward feedback across trials by adapting an outcome-based strategy, whereas the control mice followed the experimentally intended cue-association rule. This suggests that the CACNA1C gene plays a specific role in learning and highlights the importance of examining response patterns in terms of various behavioral strategies. The study's findings may have implications for treating psychiatric disorders, as the CACNA1C gene has been implicated in the pathophysiology of these conditions. The researchers used a detailed analysis of individual mouse behavior and computational models to understand how the CACNA1C gene affects learning.
Researchers studied how Wolbachia infections in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes respond to cyclical heat stress. These mosquitoes are being released in various parts of the world to help control the spread of diseases like dengue and Zika. The study found that three different types of Wolbachia infections (wMel, wAlbB, and wMelPop-CLA) behave differently when exposed to temperatures that fluctuate between 26°C and 37°C.

The wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections showed reduced expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation caused by Wolbachia, when exposed to these temperatures. Additionally, the density of Wolbachia in these infected mosquitoes decreased significantly. As a result, the wMel and wMelPop-CLA infections were not transmitted to the next generation when mosquitoes were exposed to these temperatures across their entire life cycle.

In contrast, the wAlbB infection maintained a high density of Wolbachia, exhibited complete cytoplasmic incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with high fidelity under the same temperature conditions. This study highlights the importance of temperature control in rearing Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes and has implications for the potential success of Wolbachia interventions in different environments.
Researchers studied adenoviruses in non-human primates, such as chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and macaques, to better understand how these viruses behave in the body. They found that these animals shed large amounts of infectious adenoviruses in their stool, even when they appeared to be healthy. This was a surprising discovery, as it suggests that adenoviruses can establish chronic infections that may not cause symptoms.

The researchers isolated and sequenced 33 new adenoviruses from the primates and found that they belonged to the same species as human adenoviruses. They also discovered evidence of genetic mixing between different adenoviruses, which suggests that these viruses can swap genetic material with each other. The study found that adenoviruses from different primate species are closely related, indicating that they can be transmitted between species.

The findings have important implications for the use of adenoviruses as vectors for gene therapy and genetic vaccines. The presence of persistent and latent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered when designing and interpreting studies with adenovirus vectors. The study also highlights the need for caution when handling and housing non-human primates, as they can shed infectious adenoviruses even when they appear to be healthy. Overall, the study provides new insights into the natural history of adenovirus infections and their behavior in non-human primates.
Scientists have long been interested in understanding how DNA is unwrapped from its tightly packed form in the cell's nucleus, known as chromatin. Chromatin is made up of a protein-DNA complex called the nucleosome, where DNA wraps around a core of histone proteins. To function in cellular processes, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level were not well understood. Researchers used a computer simulation method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. The simulation revealed that unwrapping the outer turn requires a free energy change of about 11.5 kcal/mol, which agrees with values obtained in single-molecule experiments. The simulation also showed that there are many potential paths to unwrapping the outer superhelical turn, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. The researchers found that the unwrapping process starts at one end of the DNA, where the first five base pairs unwrap, followed by a second five base pairs unwrapping at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then starts at the other end of the DNA, where 10 base pairs are unwrapped. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism for protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress, a condition that can lead to cell death. They found that a protein called Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) plays a crucial role in preserving the integrity of lysosomes, which are membrane-bound sacs within cells that contain digestive enzymes. Lysosomes are particularly vulnerable to damage from oxidative stress, which can disrupt their function and lead to cell death. ApoD is an antioxidant protein that is secreted by certain cells in the nervous system, including astrocytes, to help protect neurons from oxidative stress.

The researchers discovered that ApoD is endocytosed, or taken into cells, and targeted to a subset of vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. Once inside the lysosomes, ApoD helps to maintain their pH balance and prevent membrane permeabilization, which can lead to cell death. The study found that ApoD is functionally stable in the acidic environment of the lysosome and is necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidative stress.

The researchers also found that ApoD is involved in two important biological processes: myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and the optimization of autophagy in a Drosophila in vivo model. Autophagy is a process by which cells recycle damaged or dysfunctional components. The study's findings suggest that ApoD plays a critical role in maintaining lysosomal membrane integrity, which is essential for the outcome of various neurodegenerative diseases. This discovery opens up new therapeutic opportunities for treating these diseases by providing a route of entry and a repair mechanism for lysosomes in pathological situations.
Researchers studied the biology and susceptibility to Leishmania donovani of Phlebotomus orientalis sand flies from two different locations in Ethiopia: Melka Werer, a non-endemic area, and Addis Zemen, an area with a high incidence of visceral leishmaniasis. The study found that the sand flies from both locations had distinct life cycle parameters, including different requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analysis using DNA sequencing did not reveal any genetic differences between the two colonies.

The researchers also found that both colonies were highly susceptible to Leishmania donovani, with infection rates of around 50% even at the lowest infective dose tested. The development of the parasite within the sand flies was rapid, with metacyclic promastigotes present in the thoracic midgut and haptomonads colonizing the stomodeal valve by day five post-blood feeding.

The study suggests that the absence of visceral leishmaniasis in the non-endemic area of Melka Werer cannot be attributed to differences in the susceptibility of local Phlebotomus orientalis populations to Leishmania donovani. The researchers conclude that the conditions for rearing sand flies should be optimized individually for each colony, and that Phlebotomus orientalis is a highly susceptible vector of Leishmania donovani. The study provides the first detailed description of Leishmania donovani development in Phlebotomus orientalis under laboratory conditions.
Researchers in China conducted a study to quantify the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica, a serious and under-recognized disease. The study aimed to provide updated data for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which has not included advanced schistosomiasis japonica in its estimates. The researchers used a patient-based evaluation, the EQ-5D plus questionnaire, to assess the health-related quality of life of 215 patients with confirmed advanced schistosomiasis japonica. The study found that most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall disability weight (DW) for advanced schistosomiasis japonica was estimated to be 0.447, with age-specific DWs ranging from 0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged 60 years or older. The study also found that DWs were positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective factors for quality of life. These findings suggest that advanced schistosomiasis japonica has a significant impact on patients' quality of life and disability, and highlight the need for updated estimates of the disease burden in the GBD study. The study's results can inform evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomiasis control program.
A study in Kenya used national census data from 1999 to estimate population vulnerability and disability in areas where the tsetse fly is prevalent. The tsetse fly is a vector for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness, and African Animal Trypanosomiasis (AAT), also known as nagana. These diseases are common in sub-Saharan Africa and can cause significant disability and death. The study focused on Kenya's 7 tsetse belts, where the tsetse fly is a vector for T. b. rhodesiense and other trypanosoma agents that cause AAT.

The researchers used a multilevel study design to estimate the likelihood of disability in individuals, households, and tsetse fly habitats of varying levels of poverty. They found that tsetse belts with higher levels of poverty were associated with increased disability prevalence. The study also identified two pathways through which the tsetse fly contributes to disability: directly through HAT infection and indirectly through the impact of AAT on agricultural production and livestock health.

The study suggests that incorporating reports on disability from national census data could be a useful tool for enhancing HAT surveillance programs in sub-Saharan Africa. The combined burdens of HAT and AAT, as well as the opportunity costs of agricultural production in AAT areas, are likely contributors to disability within tsetse-infested areas. Future research will assess changes in the spatial relationships between high tsetse infestation and human disability using data from the 2009 Kenya census.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which a compound called hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) induces the production of HIV in chronically infected cells. HMBA is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production, but its mechanism of action was not well understood. The study found that HMBA activates a cellular pathway called PI3K/Akt, which leads to the release of a protein called P-TEFb from its inactive complex with another protein called HEXIM1 and a small RNA molecule called 7SK snRNA. This released P-TEFb is then recruited to the HIV promoter, where it stimulates the transcription of viral genes and leads to the production of new virus particles.

The researchers found that the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for the release of P-TEFb, and that a mutant form of HEXIM1 that cannot be phosphorylated and released from P-TEFb and 7SK snRNA blocks the induction of viral production by HMBA. The study also found that the released P-TEFb rapidly reassembles with 7SK snRNA and HEXIM1, but that the presence of the HIV protein Tat can prevent this reassembly and maintain the production of new virus particles.

Overall, the study reveals a new mechanism by which HMBA induces the production of HIV in chronically infected cells, and suggests that modifications in the equilibrium between active and inactive P-TEFb could contribute to cell differentiation. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of HIV transcription and may have implications for the development of new treatments for HIV infection.
Researchers have identified a link between a virus called Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) and the development of severe forms of leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Leishmaniasis can cause skin lesions, disfigurement, and even death if left untreated. In some cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, leading to mucosal or disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis, which can cause significant morbidity.

Studies have shown that LRV is present in certain strains of Leishmania parasites, including those that cause mucosal and disseminated cutaneous leishmaniasis. The virus is thought to contribute to the development of these severe forms of the disease by triggering a hyper-inflammatory response in the body. To better understand the relationship between LRV and leishmaniasis, researchers have developed new methods for detecting the virus in Leishmania parasites.

One of these methods uses an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody called J2, which can specifically and quantitatively recognize double-stranded RNA in a sequence-independent fashion. This means that the antibody can detect LRV without needing to know the specific sequence of the virus's genetic material. The J2 antibody can be used in various techniques, including immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot, making it a valuable tool for detecting LRV in Leishmania parasites.

The researchers tested the J2 antibody on several Leishmania strains, a freshly isolated patient sample, and mouse lesion biopsies, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting LRV. They propose that this method could be used as a diagnostic tool in the field to predict the risk of LRV-related complications in cutaneous leishmaniasis.
Researchers studied how two types of bacteria, enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), infect and colonize the intestines of animals. Both types of bacteria attach to intestinal cells, flatten microvilli, and create structures called actin pedestals. However, they use different proteins to trigger pedestal formation: EPEC uses a protein called Tir, while EHEC uses a protein called EspFU. The study found that EHEC's EspFU protein allows the bacteria to move more quickly across the surface of intestinal cells, forming larger colonies and infecting more cells. This is because EspFU drives the assembly of actin filaments, which enables the bacteria to move and spread to neighboring cells. In contrast, EPEC's Tir protein forms pedestals, but at a slower rate. The researchers observed that EHEC's ability to form larger colonies and move more quickly across the surface of intestinal cells gives it a colonization advantage over EPEC. This study provides new insights into how EHEC and EPEC infect and colonize the intestines, and highlights the importance of actin-based motility in the spread of infection. The findings suggest that EHEC's EspFU protein plays a key role in its ability to infect and colonize the intestines more efficiently than EPEC.
Researchers compared two methods for purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) from a parasitic worm called Fasciola hepatica. The two methods were differential centrifugation (DC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). EVs are small particles released by cells that can carry proteins and other molecules, and studying them is important for understanding how pathogens interact with their hosts. The study found that EVs purified using SEC were smaller and less diverse than those purified using DC. Additionally, SEC-purified EVs contained fewer proteins from the worm's excretory-secretory products (ESP) and tegumental components, which are parts of the worm's outer layer. This suggests that SEC is a more effective method for isolating EVs from ESP and tegumental components. The study also found that DC-purified EVs contained a higher number of proteins, many of which were previously identified in ESP and tegumental proteomic studies. This highlights the importance of using reliable protocols for EV isolation to avoid contamination from other pathogen components. The researchers conclude that SEC methods should be used for EV purification prior to downstream studies, as they provide a higher EV purity to free ESP yield ratio and a less diverse EV proteome. This is particularly important for understanding the role of EVs in host-pathogen communication and developing applications for EV-based therapies.
Researchers used a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in the development of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. They focused on the gap genes Krüppel, knirps, and giant, which play a crucial role in pattern formation during early embryonic development. By analyzing detailed, quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression, the researchers created a model of post-transcriptional regulation and determined its structural and practical identifiability. The results showed that post-transcriptional regulation is not necessary for patterning in this system, but is required for proper control of protein levels. The study demonstrated that the uniqueness and specificity of a fitted model can be rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation, increasing the potential of reverse engineering for the study of development and other complex biological processes. The researchers used a high-resolution quantitative dataset of mRNA expression patterns covering the entire blastoderm stage to test whether post-transcriptional regulation is required for the correct expression of gap protein domains. They found that the fitted models and parameter estimates were robust and specific, yielding biologically plausible and informative values for rate parameters related to the time scale and diffusive properties of gap gene patterning. The study provides new insights into the importance of post-transcriptional regulation in animal development.
Researchers investigated why infants are more susceptible to rotavirus infection, a major cause of diarrhea worldwide. They found that the expression of a specific immune receptor, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), in the intestinal epithelium changes with age. In newborn mice, TLR3 expression is low, but it increases significantly during the postnatal period. This increase in TLR3 expression is associated with a decrease in rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and tissue damage. In contrast, adult mice with a deficiency in TLR3 or a related molecule, Trif, showed increased viral shedding and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory and antiviral genes. However, newborn mice with a deficiency in TLR3 or Trif did not show impaired immune response or increased susceptibility to rotavirus. The study suggests that the upregulation of TLR3 expression in the intestinal epithelium during infancy may contribute to the age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. The researchers also found a similar age-dependent increase in TLR3 expression in human small intestinal biopsies. The study highlights the importance of the innate immune response in the intestinal epithelium in protecting against rotavirus infection, and suggests that the age-dependent increase in TLR3 expression may play a key role in this process.
Researchers analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 870 controls to identify rare genetic variations associated with the condition. The data was collected from two centers using different methods, and the researchers first ensured that the distribution of rare variations was similar between the two datasets. They then combined the data using two approaches: meta-analysis, which combines statistics from each center, and mega-analysis, which combines the data and then analyzes it. The researchers found that mega-analysis had better power to detect associations than meta-analysis. They also explored the impact of population structure on rare variant analysis and found that principal component-based analyses could control for ancestry and produce accurate test statistics. Despite using various gene-based tests and both meta- and mega-analysis, the researchers found no new risk genes for ASD in this sample. The study suggests that standard gene-based tests may require much larger samples of cases and controls to be effective for gene discovery, even for a disorder like ASD. The researchers estimate that thousands of individuals would be needed to obtain genome-wide significance. This study highlights the challenges of identifying rare genetic variants associated with complex traits like ASD.
A study investigated the link between genetic variations in the chitotriosidase gene and the risk of developing mycetoma, a fungal infection caused by Madurella mycetomatis, in a Sudanese population. The researchers found that a specific polymorphism in the chitotriosidase gene, which results in impaired enzyme activity, was associated with a higher risk of developing mycetoma. This polymorphism was identified in 112 patients with eumycetoma and 103 matched controls. The study also examined polymorphisms in the AMCase gene, which codes for another enzyme that breaks down chitin, a component of the fungal cell wall. However, no association was found between these polymorphisms and the risk of mycetoma.

The researchers isolated DNA from blood samples and used a technique called PCR-RFLP to determine the genotypes of the participants. Histological staining confirmed the presence of chitin in the fungal grain. The study's findings suggest that impaired chitinase activity, specifically due to the polymorphism in the chitotriosidase gene, may play a role in the development of mycetoma caused by Madurella mycetomatis. This is the first study to investigate the role of chitinases in eumycetoma caused by M. mycetomatis, and the results provide new insights into the genetic factors that contribute to the risk of this infection.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency, a state where the virus remains dormant in the body without causing symptoms. Traditionally, HSV was thought to have two distinct phases: an acute or lytic phase, where the virus replicates and causes symptoms, and a latent phase, where the virus remains dormant. However, recent studies have suggested that the lytic phase may not be as clear-cut as previously thought.

Using a highly sensitive Cre-marking model, the researchers found that around half of the HSV spread to latently infected sites occurred after the initial acute infection, blurring the line between the two phases. Furthermore, they discovered that lytic promoters, which drive the expression of viral genes, can also be active during latency, producing proteins that can be recognized by the immune system. This challenges the traditional view of latency as a state of complete viral dormancy.

The researchers also found that the immune system, specifically CD8+ T cells, can recognize and respond to viral proteins produced during latency. This suggests that the immune system may play a more active role in controlling the virus during latency than previously thought. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of HSV latency and the development of new treatments for the virus.
Researchers studied the accumulation of a misfolded protein called PrPSc in the brains of mice infected with three different strains of scrapie, a type of prion disease. They used a technique called dual-staining immunohistochemistry to examine the location of PrPSc in neurons and glial cells, such as astroglia and microglia, at early stages of the disease. The results showed that each strain had a distinct pattern of PrPSc accumulation, with strain 22L mainly associated with astroglia, strain ME7 mainly associated with neurons and neuropil, and strain RML showing a mix of both patterns depending on the brain region.

The researchers also analyzed the expression of 90 genes involved in neuroinflammation in the thalamus at early stages of the disease. Surprisingly, despite the differences in PrPSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains. The upregulation of these genes correlated with the activation of both astroglia and microglia, even before the appearance of vacuolar pathology or clinical signs. This suggests that the neuroinflammatory response is a common feature of prion disease, regardless of the specific strain. The study's findings may have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies against prion diseases, which are characterized by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to study the 3D organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for regulating gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long and densely packed, making it challenging to model their behavior. The new approach uses coarse-grained models, which simplify complex systems while maintaining their essential features. By accounting for the polymer entanglement length and volumic density, the model captures the steady-state structural and dynamical properties of chromosomes and tracks their dynamics at different scales. This strategy offers a significant gain in numerical efficiency and allows for the study of long chromosomes over an extended time period.

The researchers applied this approach to investigate the 3D organization of chromosome 3R in drosophila during one cell cycle. They combined the coarse-graining strategy with a one-parameter block copolymer model that incorporates epigenomic-driven interactions. The model quantitatively reproduces experimental data at the chromosome-scale and predicts that chromatin motion is highly dynamic during the cell cycle. The study demonstrates the utility of the coarse-graining approach in studying chromatin organization in drosophila and highlights the importance of accounting for the time evolution of chromosome organization in quantitative models, particularly for higher eukaryotes where chromosomes are strongly topologically constrained. The new strategy can be applied to any self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems, offering a systematic way to develop coarse-grained null models for chromosomes.
Researchers analyzed data from 11 studies on 7 cell types to better understand how genetic variations affect gene expression. They combined this data with information on cis-regulatory elements (CREs), which are regions of DNA that control gene expression. The study found that genetic variants associated with gene expression (eQTLs) often overlap with CREs specific to certain cell types. This overlap is linked to the cell type specificity of eQTLs, meaning that the same genetic variant can have different effects on gene expression in different cell types. The researchers used machine learning algorithms to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs based on their overlap with CREs. They also demonstrated that CREs from a specific cell type can be used to annotate genetic associations with diseases, even if eQTL data is not available for that cell type. This approach can help researchers understand the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases and improve the interpretation of genetic associations. The study suggests that integrating eQTL data with CRE information can provide valuable insights into the cell type specificity of genetic variants and their effects on gene expression. This knowledge can aid in the development of mechanistic models of disease and improve our understanding of human complex phenotypic variation.
Scientists have been working to develop a vaccine against HIV-1, a virus that causes AIDS. A key challenge is creating a vaccine that can elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs), which can recognize and neutralize the virus. Recent research has shown that many bNAbs target glycan-dependent epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope protein gp120. However, current cell lines used for vaccine production, such as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, add complex and hybrid glycosylation to the protein, making it difficult to produce vaccine immunogens that display these glycan-dependent epitopes.

To overcome this challenge, researchers used the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system to create a new CHO cell line that limits glycosylation to early intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This cell line, called MGAT1− CHO, contains a mutation that inactivates the MGAT1 gene, which is responsible for adding complex glycosylation to the protein. The MGAT1− CHO cell line produces monomeric gp120s that exhibit improved binding to glycan-dependent bNAbs, such as PG9, PGT128, and 10-1074, while preserving the structure of glycan-independent epitopes, such as VRC01.

The MGAT1− CHO cell line has several advantages, including the ability to grow at high cell densities and maintain a stable doubling time. This makes it a promising substrate for the biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. The development of this cell line is an important step towards creating a vaccine that can elicit bNAbs and provide protection against HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have identified a promising target for developing new treatments against parasitic nematodes, which cause devastating diseases in tropical regions. Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase (T6PP) is an enzyme essential for the survival of nematodes, but not found in mammals. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, T6PP is crucial for breaking down trehalose-6-phosphate, a toxic compound that accumulates when the enzyme is absent. The researchers determined the three-dimensional structure of T6PP from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi using X-ray crystallography. The structure revealed a unique combination of a stabilizing N-terminal domain and a catalytic C-terminal domain. By analyzing the structure, the researchers identified five key residues important for binding and catalysis. They also developed a model of the T6PP-trehalose 6-phosphate complex, which suggests that high-affinity inhibitors will bind to the phosphoryl-binding pocket and the trehalose pocket simultaneously. This approach could lead to the development of broad-range anthelmintic and antibacterial therapeutics. The conservation of key residues in T6PP enzymes from parasitic nematodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests that a common strategy for inhibitor design could be applied to both anthelmintics and antibiotics.
Researchers have developed a new computational model to simulate how fluids move through tumors. This model takes into account the unique and disorganized structure of blood vessels within tumors, which can make it difficult for treatments to reach cancer cells effectively. The model uses data from real tumors to create a detailed simulation of fluid flow and transport within the tumor microenvironment. This allows for highly controlled experiments to be performed, providing insights into how tumor vascular heterogeneity affects fluid transport.

The model was applied to two types of tumors: an orthotopic murine glioma and a human colorectal carcinoma. The results showed that incorporating realistic tumor vasculature is crucial for accurately predicting fluid flow heterogeneities caused by blood vessels. Contrary to previous findings, the study suggests that reducing tumor interstitial fluid pressure is not necessary to increase interstitial perfusion. Instead, developing an interstitial fluid pressure gradient across the tumor is the key response. The researchers also found that vascular normalization may alter interstitial hydraulic conductivity within tumors, and that stabilizing vessel diameters and permeabilities may not be key responses following vascular normalization.

The study's findings have implications for the development of anti-cancer therapies. The researchers suggest that normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumors. This could lead to more targeted and effective treatments for cancer.
Researchers have investigated how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) spreads from one cell to another, a process known as cell-cell transmission. This mode of transmission is thought to play a significant role in HIV infection, but its importance and vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors have not been fully understood. To study this, scientists developed experimental methods to distinguish between cell-free and cell-cell transmission of HIV. They found that neutralizing antibodies, which target specific parts of the HIV envelope protein, have varying levels of effectiveness against cell-cell transmission. Specifically, antibodies that target the CD4 binding site (CD4bs) of the HIV envelope protein, such as the potent neutralizing antibody VRC01, lose their potency during cell-cell transmission. In contrast, antibodies that target other parts of the envelope protein, such as gp41, remain effective. This suggests that CD4bs antibodies primarily block free virus transmission, while allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts. The study's findings have implications for the design of HIV vaccines and entry inhibitors, which may need to target both cell-free and cell-cell transmission modes to be effective.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain how attention affects neural responses in the visual system. The model suggests that top-down attentional modulation in higher visual areas, such as V4 or MT, can produce complex changes in neural firing rates and receptive field structure. This is achieved through modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. The model redistributes the top-down modulation to lower areas, altering the inputs of other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive the initial modulation. This produces effects such as receptive field expansion towards the focus of attention and receptive field shifts. The model also predicts that attentional effects on response curves should shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus of attention drifts away from the studied cell. The proposed model is simple and requires only the existence of modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range lateral inhibition within each area. It reproduces the observed attentional effects on response rates and receptive field structure without modifying model parameters. This model differs from existing models, which often posit that attention operates through gain modulation of inputs to the studied layer. The researchers suggest that the observed effects of attention arise spontaneously from the interaction of feedback connections between higher and lower areas and short-range divisive mutual inhibition between neighboring cells within each area.
In Drosophila, a small group of specialized cells called the posterior signalling centre (PSC) plays a crucial role in controlling blood cell homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. The PSC acts in a non-cell-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) signalling in hematopoietic progenitors, allowing them to differentiate into lamellocytes, a type of immune cell required to fight specific threats such as wasp parasitism. Researchers have identified a short type I cytokine-related receptor called CG14225/Latran, which is required to switch off JAK/STAT signalling in prohemocytes, a prerequisite for massive differentiation of lamellocytes upon wasp parasitism. Latran forms heteromers with Domeless, the Drosophila type I cytokine signalling receptor, and antagonizes its activity in a dose-dependent manner. In response to wasp parasitism, there is a strong decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph gland, followed by an increase in the Latran/Domeless ratio, leading to the complete inhibition of residual JAK/STAT signalling. This study provides the first in vivo example of a role for a non-signalling receptor in controlling a dedicated immune response, raising questions about the potential role of similar receptors in vertebrate cellular immunity.
Researchers studied how two viruses, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and Tomato leaf curl Comoros virus (ToLCV), interact and exchange genetic material when infecting tomato plants over a 120-day period. They found that the exchange of genetic material, or recombination, between the two viruses is a complex process that is influenced by the similarity of the viruses' genetic sequences and the interactions between their proteins and nucleic acids. The study revealed that recombination breakpoints, or the points at which genetic material is exchanged, are more likely to occur in areas of high sequence similarity between the two viruses. However, the researchers also found that the overall patterns of recombination are shaped by natural selection, which favors the survival of recombinant viruses with intact protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. This selection pressure is so strong that it can even be used to identify the specific genetic sequences involved in these interactions. The study observed a wide range of recombination patterns, with some recombinant viruses having as many as 58 detectable recombination breakpoints. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of recombination in begomoviruses, a family of viruses that includes many crop pathogens, and highlight the importance of considering the interactions between viral proteins and nucleic acids in understanding the evolution of these viruses.
Researchers studied the relationship between nucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, and the evolution of eukaryotic genomes. They found that despite differences between eukaryotic and archaeal nucleosomes, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence evolution is conserved between humans and the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii. This suggests that nucleosomes may influence the evolution of eukaryotic genomes by altering the propensity of DNA to mutate and by selection acting to maintain or exclude nucleosomes in particular locations.

The researchers compared substitution patterns around nucleosome footprints in humans to substitution dynamics in the Haloferax clade, a group of halophilic archaea. They found that substitution patterns around nucleosome footprints in both humans and Haloferax volcanii are biased towards GC-rich sequences. This could be due to nucleosome repositioning in response to changes at the sequence level, as both archaeal and eukaryotic histone complexes share a preference for GC-rich sequences.

However, the researchers found that neither mutation nor selection can explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence divergence. Instead, they demonstrated that nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are more consistent with a model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. They showed that nucleosome repositioning is both necessary and largely sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution patterns. This finding highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
Researchers have identified key positions in proteins that are crucial for maintaining conformational diversity, which is essential for protein function. This diversity allows proteins to bind to different ligands and perform various tasks. The study used a novel method to analyze protein structures and found that certain positions, mostly buried aliphatic residues, are highly conserved across different species. These positions are located in regular structural regions of the protein, such as beta-sheets and alpha-helices.

The researchers applied their method to a dataset of 188 paired protein structures in their ligand-free and ligand-bound forms. They found that mutations at these key positions can significantly alter the protein's ability to bind to ligands. The study suggests that these positions are evolutionarily conserved because they play a critical role in maintaining the protein's conformational diversity. This diversity is necessary for the protein to bind to different ligands and perform its function.

The researchers used normal mode analysis to identify the key positions. Normal modes are vibrational motions of the protein that are associated with conformational changes. The study found that certain normal modes are more involved in the conformational change between the ligand-free and ligand-bound states. By analyzing the effect of mutations on these normal modes, the researchers identified the key positions that are crucial for maintaining conformational diversity. The study provides new insights into the importance of conformational diversity in protein function and the evolution of proteins.
Researchers have investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium responsible for tuberculosis. FBA is a key enzyme in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, the processes by which cells break down and build up glucose. To understand the importance of FBA in Mtb's metabolism, the researchers created a strain of Mtb with reduced FBA levels. They found that without FBA, Mtb was cleared from the body in both the early and late stages of infection, and was unable to survive in a lab dish when grown on a single carbon source. However, when grown on a mixture of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources, Mtb was able to compensate for the lack of FBA. The researchers discovered that this compensation required a specific balance of glucose and butyrate, a type of fatty acid, and that Mtb's ability to metabolize butyrate depended on its ability to co-catabolize glucose. These findings suggest that FBA could be a potential target for new tuberculosis treatments, and highlight the complexity of Mtb's metabolism in different environments. The study also underscores the importance of understanding how Mtb adapts to different host environments in order to develop effective treatments.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXNPx) in the parasite Leishmania, which causes leishmaniasis. This protein is part of a family of enzymes that help remove peroxides, which are molecules that can damage cells. Leishmania lacks other enzymes that typically remove peroxides, so mTXNPx is crucial for the parasite's survival. However, the researchers found that mTXNPx is not necessary for the parasite to remove peroxides. Instead, they discovered that mTXNPx acts as a molecular chaperone, helping other proteins to fold correctly and function properly. Without mTXNPx, the parasite is unable to infect mice. The researchers created a version of mTXNPx that was unable to remove peroxides and found that it could still rescue the parasite's ability to infect mice. This suggests that mTXNPx's role in infection is not related to its ability to remove peroxides. The study challenges the idea that all 2-Cys peroxiredoxins, like mTXNPx, are primarily involved in removing peroxides. The researchers propose that mTXNPx's chaperone activity is essential for the parasite's ability to infect mammals. This is the first time that a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin has been shown to play a role in pathogenicity that is independent of its peroxidase activity. The study provides new insights into the biology of Leishmania and the role of mTXNPx in its life cycle.
Researchers conducted a multicenter study in Mexico to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Histoplasma urine antigen (HUAg) test, specifically the IMMY ALPHA Histoplasma EIA, for diagnosing progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH) in HIV-infected patients. The study included 288 patients with suspected PDH and compared the results of the HUAg test to a reference standard of Histoplasma capsulatum growth on blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or compatible histopathologic exam. The study found that the sensitivity of the HUAg test was 67.1%, meaning it correctly identified 67.1% of patients with PDH, and the specificity was 97.5%, meaning it correctly identified 97.5% of patients without PDH. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2, indicating that a positive test result is 27.2 times more likely in patients with PDH than in those without. The study also found that 10.5% of patients with PDH had co-existing opportunistic infections, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection. The researchers concluded that while the HUAg test has high specificity, its low sensitivity means that a negative result does not rule out PDH, and a culture-based approach is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. The study suggests that the HUAg test may be useful for starting early antifungal treatment, but a negative result should be followed up with further testing.
Researchers used a new approach called "micro-mass sequencing" to study the viruses present in the stool of 12 children with diarrhea. This method allows for the analysis of small amounts of stool, as little as 100 milligrams, and can detect both known and unknown viruses. The goal of the study was to identify the diversity of viral communities in the stool of children with diarrhea and to determine if any new or unexpected viruses play a role in causing the condition.

The study found that micro-mass sequencing was effective in detecting known enteric viruses, such as rotavirus and norovirus, as well as multiple sequences from putatively novel viruses with limited similarity to known viruses in a database called GenBank. The researchers were able to detect these viruses by sequencing only a few hundred colonies from each sample library.

This study builds on previous research that has explored the structure of virus communities in various ecosystems, including the ocean and the human gut. However, this is the first metagenomic investigation of the viral diversity found in human diarrhea. The results of this study provide a foundation for further research into the roles of these diverse viruses in the gastrointestinal tract and could potentially lead to a better understanding of the causes of diarrhea and the development of new treatments.
A study in the Dominican Republic compared the Zika and dengue outbreaks that occurred in the country between 2015 and 2016. Researchers analyzed national surveillance data to understand the transmission dynamics of these two arboviruses, which are spread by mosquitoes. The study found that dengue cases were more common among people under the age of 20, while Zika infections were more evenly distributed across the population. Dengue attack rates were slightly higher in males, while Zika infections were more common in females. The reproductive number (R0), a measure of how easily a disease spreads, was also higher in females for Zika. However, the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a complication of Zika infection, was slightly higher in males. The study suggests that existing immunity to dengue does not affect the risk of Zika infection. The researchers propose that community awareness campaigns may have contributed to the higher reporting of Zika cases among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. They recommend that women of reproductive age be targeted with media campaigns and screening during Zika outbreaks. The study also highlights the need for further research on the clinical outcomes of Zika infection in individuals who have previously been infected with dengue.
In plants, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) play a crucial role in responding to DNA damage and immune responses. Unlike in animals, where PARP1 is the primary enzyme responsible for poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, the study found that PARP2 is the predominant PARP in Arabidopsis thaliana. PARP2, rather than PARP1, makes the greatest contribution to PARP activity and organismal viability in response to genotoxic stresses caused by bleomycin, mitomycin C, or gamma-radiation. PARP2 also plays a significant role in plant immune responses, including the restriction of pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato growth and reduction of infection-associated DNA double-strand break abundance.

The study also found that poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) enzymes, specifically PARG1, are responsible for removing poly(ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins in Arabidopsis. The activity or abundance of PARP2 is influenced by PARP1 and PARG1, and the two enzymes physically interact with each other and with PARG1 and PARG2. The study suggests that the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in plants is distinct from that in animals, with PARP2 and PARG1 playing the predominant roles in plant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation during DNA damage and immune responses. Overall, the study highlights the importance of PARP2 in plant responses to DNA damage and immune responses, and provides new insights into the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation in plants.
Researchers have identified a new signaling pathway in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in synapse formation and learning. The pathway, which includes the kinases MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, opposes the activity of the RPM-1 protein, which is involved in regulating synapse formation and axon termination. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway specifically suppresses defects in synapse formation in the mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants, but does not affect axon termination. This suggests that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions as a parallel opposing pathway to RPM-1. Overexpression of the kinases in the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway is sufficient to impair synapse formation in wild-type animals, indicating that this pathway is involved in regulating glutamatergic synapse formation. The MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway functions cell autonomously in the mechanosensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, providing further evidence of its role in synapse development. Loss of MIG-15/JNK-1 signaling also suppresses defects in habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit that is likely to arise from impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. These findings indicate that the MIG-15/JNK-1 pathway can restrict both glutamatergic synapse formation and short-term learning.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called TRA-1 plays a crucial role in determining the sex of hermaphroditic nematodes, such as Caenorhabditis elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae. TRA-1 is a bipotential protein, meaning it can both activate and repress the same target genes in response to different signals. The study found that TRA-1 works with a co-factor called TRR-1 to control the sperm/oocyte decision in C. briggsae. TRR-1 is required for spermatogenesis and promotes the expression of a gene called Cbr-fog-3, which is necessary for sperm development. The researchers also discovered that TRR-1 regulates the development of the male tail and that it works through TRA-1 to activate Cbr-fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision.

The study found that the relationship between TRR-1 and TRA-1 has evolved differently in C. briggsae and C. elegans. In C. briggsae, TRR-1 null mutants prevent hermaphrodite spermatogenesis, but in C. elegans, fem null mutants have the same effect. However, synthetic interactions confirmed that both halves of the switch exist in each species. This suggests that the relationship between the two halves of a bipotential switch can shift rapidly during evolution, allowing the same phenotype to be produced by alternative mechanisms. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of sex determination in hermaphroditic nematodes.
Researchers developed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify integrated information in time-series data, overcoming limitations of the existing ΦDM measure. ΦDM is a measure of integrated information that quantifies the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states. However, ΦDM is defined only for discrete Markov systems, which are rare in biology, making it difficult to apply in practice. The new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, are designed to be easy to apply to time-series data and can be used to examine information integration in real and model systems. The researchers used simulations to demonstrate the applicability of the new measures and explored their properties. The results provide new opportunities for studying the relationship between integrated information, consciousness, and other neurocognitive processes. However, the findings also pose challenges for theories that attribute physical meaning to the measured quantities. Future work will involve applying the new measures to neuroimaging and other biological datasets to test intuitions about consciousness and other neurocognitive processes, investigating how integrated information is modulated by input and output relations, and determining the theoretical implications of the new measures. The development of ΦE and ΦAR addresses the need for a measure of integrated information that is framed in terms of process and is easy to apply in practice, allowing for the formulation of testable hypotheses and the specification of synthetic models to examine the role of integrated information in neurocognitive processes.
Researchers in Uganda have been studying the spread of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a disease caused by a parasite that can be transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tsetse fly. In recent years, the disease has spread to new areas of the country, raising concerns about its potential overlap with another form of the disease, Gambian HAT. To better understand the factors contributing to the spread of Rhodesian HAT, researchers used a statistical method called Bayesian geostatistical analysis to examine the relationship between the disease's prevalence and various environmental and social factors in two districts of Uganda.

The study found that the disease was likely introduced to the area through the movement of infected, untreated livestock from endemic areas. The analysis also showed that healthcare accessibility and minimum land surface temperature played a role in the disease's distribution. To predict the risk of high HAT prevalence in the future, the researchers created a map that highlighted areas surrounding livestock markets as high-risk zones. This suggests that the livestock trade is a key factor in the continued spread of the disease. The study's findings emphasize the importance of treating livestock at the point of sale to prevent the spread of sleeping sickness in Uganda. By using a more robust statistical method, the researchers were able to provide stronger evidence for the role of livestock trade in the spread of Rhodesian HAT and improve the accuracy of their predictions.
A long-held assumption in the field of ecology is that complex ecosystems are more stable than simple ones. However, a recent study challenges this idea by examining the feasibility of equilibria in large ecosystems. Equilibrium refers to a state where the populations of different species in an ecosystem remain stable over time. The researchers found that in species-rich systems, the existence of a feasible equilibrium is not guaranteed. In fact, the probability of observing such a point decreases exponentially as the size of the network grows. This means that as ecosystems become more complex, it becomes increasingly unlikely for them to reach a stable equilibrium. The study also found that the strength of interactions between species plays a crucial role in determining the stability of the ecosystem. With weak interactions, non-trivial feasible equilibria are found only in ecologically-inspired systems. The researchers suggest that a general understanding of ecosystem dynamics requires considering the interplay between interaction strength, network architecture, and species richness. This study provides new insights into the complexity-stability debate and highlights the importance of considering the feasibility of equilibria in large ecosystems. The findings have implications for our understanding of how ecosystems function and how they respond to environmental changes.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to investigate the sero-epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii, the bacterium responsible for Q fever, in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 2,049 humans and 955 cattle in 416 homesteads were analyzed for C. burnetii antibodies, and questionnaires were administered to gather demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information. The study found a sero-prevalence of 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle, but no correlation between cattle and human seroprevalence was observed. Multilevel regression analysis identified several factors associated with exposure to C. burnetii, including cattle obtained from markets and those residing in areas with lower precipitation levels. For humans, the youngest age group had the highest odds of seropositivity, and variations were observed between ethnic groups. Frequent livestock contact, particularly grazing and dealing with abortion material, was also a risk factor. The study suggests that environmental factors may play a role in cattle exposure patterns, but human exposure patterns are likely driven more strongly by livestock contacts. The findings highlight the importance of livestock contact in the transmission of C. burnetii and indicate that livestock markets may be a suitable target for interventions to reduce the risk of Q fever.
Researchers have identified three vasa-like DEAD-box RNA helicases in the genome of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. These helicases, Smvlg1, Smvlg2, and Smvlg3, are similar to the Vasa protein found in other animals, which is a marker of primordial germ cells and the germ line. The researchers used bioinformatics to identify the helicases in the S. mansoni genome and confirmed their presence through phylogenetic analysis. They also found that the genes are expressed in various developmental stages of the parasite, including sporocysts, adult females, eggs, and miracidia, with high expression in the undeveloped egg. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed that the genes are transcribed in the posterior ovary, where oocytes mature.

The discovery of these vasa-like genes in S. mansoni is significant because it provides a potential landmark for germ line transgenesis of the parasite. Transgenesis is a technique used to introduce genes into an organism's germ line, allowing researchers to study the function of specific genes. The vasa-like genes could be used to monitor the introduction of transgenes into the schistosome germ line, which could aid in the development of novel anti-schistosomal interventions. The researchers suggest that the vasa-like genes may be valuable markers in functional genomics of S. mansoni, but their expression pattern may impact their use as markers for germ cell identification and transformation.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for a protein called VGLL4 in the development and maintenance of heart valves. Heart valve disease is a significant health issue worldwide, and understanding how these valves form and function is essential for preventing and treating related conditions. The Hippo signaling pathway, which is involved in organ development and tissue homeostasis, has been found to play a role in heart valve formation, but its specific function in this process was not well understood.

The study found that VGLL4, a transcription cofactor in vertebrates, is expressed in valve interstitial cells and is necessary for proper heart valve development. When VGLL4 was deleted in endothelial cells, the cells that line the heart valves, the valves developed abnormally and the heart became hypertrophied. However, when the YAP protein, a key component of the Hippo pathway, was partially deleted in VGLL4-ablated hearts, the valve malformation was rescued.

These findings suggest that VGLL4 plays a critical role in regulating the Hippo pathway to ensure proper heart valve development and maintenance. The study also found that VGLL4 is necessary for balancing cell proliferation and apoptosis during development and tissue homeostasis. The researchers propose that manipulating the Hippo pathway could be a potential therapy for preventing the progression of congenital heart valve disease. Overall, this study provides new insights into the mechanisms of heart valve development and highlights the importance of VGLL4 in maintaining proper heart valve function.
Recent studies have suggested that soft selective sweeps, a type of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation, are widespread across different organisms, including humans, flies, and viruses. However, other researchers have questioned the validity of these findings, arguing that the models used to identify soft sweeps are flawed and prone to false positives. A new study has re-examined three recent studies that claimed to have found evidence of soft sweeps in these organisms and found that they are likely incorrect. The study used population genetic theory and simulations to evaluate the methodologies used in these studies and found that they are prone to high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under both hard sweep and neutral models. The study suggests that well-fit demographic histories combined with rare hard sweeps are a more parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns of genomic variation. The authors argue that the lack of sufficient model testing and statistical performance analyses in previous studies has led to inaccurate views of the evolutionary processes governing these organisms. They also suggest that the generalization of these results has resulted in misleading answers to long-standing questions in population genetics. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the role of positive selection in shaping patterns of genomic variation in different organisms.
Researchers studied the behavior of female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which spread dengue fever to humans. They found that after feeding on blood, these mosquitoes stop searching for hosts for three days. A peptide called Head Peptide-I is thought to be responsible for this behavior change, but how it works was unknown. The researchers discovered that Head Peptide-I is similar to a group of peptides called short Neuropeptide-F peptides (sNPFs), which signal through Neuropeptide Y-Like Receptors (NPYLRs). They identified eight NPYLRs in the Aedes aegypti genome and tested them for sensitivity to various peptides. Four of these receptors responded to one or more peptides, but only NPYLR1 responded to Head Peptide-I and sNPFs. The researchers also found that injecting Head Peptide-I and sNPF-3 into non-blood-fed mosquitoes inhibited their host-seeking behavior. To see if NPYLR1 is necessary for this behavior change, they created mosquitoes without the NPYLR1 gene and found that they still behaved normally. This suggests that NPYLR1 is not the only receptor responsible for host-seeking inhibition, and other receptors or peptides may also play a role. The researchers propose two possible models for how host-seeking behavior is regulated in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes.
Researchers in Nigeria used satellite imagery and spatial analysis to identify areas at risk for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease, in the Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State. The study focused on six environmental factors: temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/cover. These factors were weighted using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to determine their importance in schistosomiasis transmission. The weighted factors were then overlaid to create a map of schistosomiasis risk zones. The results showed that 82% of the area falls under high or very high risk categories. One community, Oba Ile, had the lowest risk, while the risk increased in four other communities: Iju, Igoba, Ita Ogbolu, and Ogbese. The predictions made by the model correlated strongly with observations from a field study, indicating that environmental factors can be used to identify and predict schistosomiasis transmission. The study suggests that remote sensing and geographical information system-based spatial analyses can be used to determine the geographical limits of disease distribution, understand disease ecology and epidemiology, and support prevention, surveillance, and control efforts. The study also confirmed that satellite-derived environmental data can be used to determine schistosomiasis risk levels in an area.
Bacterial meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcal meningitis, is a serious infection of the brain that can lead to long-term disabilities and cognitive impairments in survivors. Researchers have identified a key factor contributing to this damage: a toxin called pneumolysin, which is produced by the bacteria. Pneumolysin is a pore-forming toxin that can disrupt the regulation of glutamate, a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in brain function. When pneumolysin is present, it can cause the release of excess glutamate in the brain, leading to damage to the connections between brain cells, known as synapses. This damage can result in the loss of dendritic spines, which are essential for learning and memory.

In a study using post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumococcal meningitis and an animal model of the disease, researchers found that pneumolysin was responsible for the selective loss of synapses in the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex. They also found that exposure to pneumolysin at non-lethal concentrations caused permanent damage to brain cells, including dendritic swelling, spine elimination, and synaptic loss. The researchers propose that pneumolysin plays a significant role in the development of pneumococcal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from brain cells called astrocytes, leading to excitotoxic damage. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying pneumococcal meningitis and highlights the importance of pneumolysin in causing synaptic damage and cognitive impairments in survivors of the disease.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a DNA virus that causes major human cancers. To develop new ways to prevent HPV infections, researchers need to understand how the virus infects cells. HPV infects cells in the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but it's unclear why this is the case. Researchers used chemical biology approaches to study how HPV infects cells and found that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection. They used human keratinocytes and infectious HPV16 particles to show that the recipient cell must enter the M phase of the cell cycle for HPV infection to take place. Inhibitors of the G1, S, G2, and early M phases of the cell cycle prevented infection, but late M phase inhibitors did not. The researchers conclude that host cells need to pass through early prophase for successful onset of transcription of the HPV encapsidated genes. This finding provides one reason why HPVs initially establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia. The basal compartment is the only part of the epithelium where cells are progressing through the cell cycle, making it the only place where HPVs can establish their infection. These results have important implications for HPV control, as they define a major condition for cell susceptibility to HPV infection. Further research is needed to confirm these findings in primary keratinocytes and in vivo models.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the thermal dimorphic fungus Penicillium marneffei, which causes systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. The study used high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze small RNAs in both mycelial and yeast phases of the fungus. The results revealed 24 potential milRNA candidates, with 17 in the mycelial phase and 7 in the yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins, and the gene qde-2, encoding an Argonaute-like protein, were identified in P. marneffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed that dcl-2 is more closely related to homologues in other thermal dimorphic pathogenic fungi than to Penicillium chrysogenum and Aspergillus spp.

Northern blot analysis confirmed the expression of two milRNAs, PM-milR-M1 and PM-milR-M2, only in the mycelial phase. The biogenesis of both milRNAs was found to be dependent on dcl-2, but not dcl-1 or qde-2. The study also showed that the mRNA expression levels of three predicted targets of PM-milR-M1 were upregulated in a knockdown strain, supporting the regulatory function of milRNAs. These findings provide the first evidence for differential expression of milRNAs in different growth phases of thermal dimorphic fungi and shed light on the evolution of fungal proteins involved in milRNA biogenesis and the possible role of post-transcriptional control in governing thermal dimorphism.
Researchers studied the ability of two types of mosquitoes, Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, to transmit the Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Pacific region. These mosquitoes are potential carriers of the virus, which caused a significant outbreak in the region between 2013 and 2017. The study aimed to evaluate and compare the vector competence of wild populations of these mosquitoes from different Pacific islands for a ZIKV strain that circulated during the outbreak.

The researchers collected mosquitoes from three Aedes aegypti populations and two Aedes polynesiensis populations from the Pacific region and exposed them to a ZIKV strain isolated in the region in 2014. They analyzed the mosquitoes for infection, dissemination, transmission rates, and transmission efficiency at different time points after infection.

The results showed that the infection rates were heterogeneous among the Aedes aegypti populations, but the dissemination rates were moderate and more homogeneous. For Aedes polynesiensis, the infection rates were less heterogeneous between the two populations tested. The transmission rate and efficiency results revealed a low vector competence for ZIKV of the different Aedes vector populations under study.

The study found that both Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis had a low ability to transmit ZIKV, which was unexpected. The researchers suggest that other factors, such as vector density, mosquito lifespan, and the large immunologically naive fraction of the population, may have contributed to the rapid spread of the ZIKV in the Pacific region during the outbreak.
Researchers have developed a new method called Targeted Structure-Seq to study the structure of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cells. LncRNAs, such as Xist, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, but their complex structures make it difficult to understand how they function. Targeted Structure-Seq combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with target-specific massively parallel sequencing, allowing for high coverage of the target RNA with relatively few sequencing reads. This approach provides a targeted and scalable way to analyze RNA conformation in cells.

Using Targeted Structure-Seq, researchers probed the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within Xist, including the repeat A element in the 5'-end of Xist. The analysis also identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the C repeats that is important for Xist function. The repeat A region of Xist is a functional element important for gene repression, and the new models provide insight into its structure and function.

The researchers validated the utility of Targeted Structure-Seq to study lncRNA conformation in mammalian cells and expect it to be particularly useful for advancing our mechanistic understanding of lncRNAs. The data from Targeted Structure-Seq can be used to develop a conformational model of full-length Xist, providing new insights into the structure and function of this important lncRNA.
A new statistical framework has been developed to evaluate the predictive power of genetic variants for complex diseases. The framework connects various predictive indices, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), to provide a more comprehensive assessment of genetic risk prediction models. The framework takes into account the overall disease probability and the level of variance in total liability explained by the genetic variants, allowing for the estimation of multiple prediction metrics. These metrics include the AUC, mean risk difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases explained by a specific percentile of population at the highest risk, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile.

The framework also enables the construction of graphs to visualize the performance of risk models, such as the ROC curve, density of risks, and predictiveness curve. The results from simulations match well with theoretical estimates. The framework was applied to nine complex diseases, evaluating the predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants for each trait. The study highlights the importance of complementing AUC with other measures to assess the performance of genetic risk prediction models, as a high level of statistical significance does not necessarily equate to good predictive power. The framework provides a unifying approach to evaluating the predictive power of genetic variants and can be used to assess the clinical utility of genetic risk prediction models.
Researchers developed a new rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a parasite that causes human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), using recombinant antigens. The new test, called SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, was compared to an existing RDT made with native antigens (SD BIOLINE HAT) and the traditional Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomiasis (CATT). The study involved screening 57,632 individuals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and confirmed 260 HAT cases through parasitology. The results showed that SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity (71.2%), followed by CATT (62.5%) and SD BIOLINE HAT (59.0%). CATT was the most specific test (99.2%), while SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 had specificities of 98.9% and 98.1%, respectively. Combining two or three tests significantly increased sensitivity, with a combination of SD BIOLINE HAT and SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0 reaching 98.4% in passive screening and 83.0% in active screening. The recombinant antigen-based RDT was more sensitive than SD BIOLINE HAT but less specific than CATT. The study suggests that using multiple tests can enhance diagnostic sensitivity, but may also decrease specificity.
A decade of vector control activities in the municipality of Comapa, Guatemala, has shown mixed results in controlling Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of Latin Americans. Despite multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying (IRS), a few foci remain with persistent Triatoma dimidiata infestation. A study conducted in Comapa found that the infestation index decreased significantly from 39% in 2001-2002 to 27% in 2011 after multiple rounds of IRS. However, household construction materials alone predicted less than 10% of infested houses. Chagas seroprevalence in school-aged children declined by 10-fold, from 10% in 1999 to 1% in 2015. However, seroprevalence in women of childbearing age remains above 10%. The study suggests that while there is evidence of reduced transmission, the continued risk for vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to the 2022 Chagas disease elimination goal. To reach this goal, systematic integrated vector control and improved Chagas disease screening and treatment programs for congenital and vector-borne disease are needed in regions with persistent vector infestation.
Researchers have found that Citrobacter rodentium, a bacterium that causes disease in mice, has a highly unstable genome. This instability is due to the presence of mobile genetic elements, such as prophages, that can jump from one part of the genome to another, causing large-scale rearrangements. The researchers sequenced two strains of C. rodentium, ICC168 and EX-33, and found that they share many similarities, suggesting that the reference strain ICC168 is representative of the species. They also found that many of the mutations that inactivate genes in C. rodentium are common to both strains and likely occurred early in the evolution of the pathogen. This suggests that C. rodentium may have emerged as a significant pathogen relatively recently, possibly in response to the development of inbred mice as a model for human disease. The researchers draw parallels with the evolution of other bacterial pathogens and propose that C. rodentium is a recently evolved pathogen that is still adapting to its new lifestyle. The study highlights the importance of mobile genetic elements in shaping the evolution of bacterial genomes and suggests that C. rodentium's instability may be a key factor in its ability to cause disease. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of bacterial pathogens and the development of new treatments.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework to analyze stochasticity in gene expression, which refers to the random fluctuations in protein levels across cell populations. These fluctuations can provide valuable information about the molecular mechanisms governing gene expression. However, current methods for inferring these mechanisms are often limited by assumptions and are not efficient. The new framework proposes a method to estimate biochemical rate constants that govern chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from protein expression distributions without making any assumptions. The method involves deriving analytical solutions for the first four moments of the protein distribution, which capture the shape of the distribution, and developing an efficient algorithm to infer gene expression rate constants from these moments. The framework was tested on various protein distributions and found to accurately estimate individual biochemical rate constants or meaningful ratios of rate constants in 91% of cases. The method can distinguish between different regimes of gene expression, such as transcriptional bursting and constitutive transcript production. The framework has the potential to be a powerful tool for understanding the contributions of specific molecular mechanisms to patterns of gene expression.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine strategy to protect against monkeypox virus (MPXV), a disease that is endemic in parts of Africa and has the potential to be used as a bioterror agent. The new approach uses three recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV-4) vectors, each expressing different MPXV glycoproteins, to provide immunity against the virus. In a small challenge study, the BoHV-4 vectors were shown to be safe and effective in protecting STAT1 knockout mice against a lethal MPXV challenge, with 100% protection when used alone and 80% protection when used in combination. The study demonstrates the potential of BoHV-4 as a vaccine-vector platform for protecting against MPXV. This is significant because current vaccines against smallpox, which also provide some protection against MPXV, are associated with morbidity and are contraindicated for a large proportion of the population. Additionally, there are no FDA-approved therapies against MPXV, and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. The development of a new vaccine strategy is crucial for controlling the spread of MPXV, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic. The use of BoHV-4 vectors offers a promising approach for protecting against MPXV, and further research is needed to explore its potential as a vaccine against this disease.
Researchers have identified a new enzyme in trypanosomes, a type of parasite, that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of messenger RNA (mRNA). The enzyme, called ALPH1, is a type of phosphatase that removes phosphate groups from the end of mRNA molecules, a process known as decapping. This process is essential for the degradation of mRNA, which is a key step in regulating gene expression.

Unlike other organisms, trypanosomes do not have a traditional decapping complex, which is a group of enzymes that work together to remove the cap from mRNA. Instead, ALPH1 appears to be the primary decapping enzyme in trypanosomes. The researchers found that ALPH1 is essential for the breakdown of mRNA and that its depletion leads to the accumulation of deadenylated mRNA molecules that have not yet started degradation.

ALPH1 is also found in a specialized granule at the posterior pole of the cell, where it co-localizes with the 5'-3' exoribonuclease XRNA. This suggests that ALPH1 and XRNA work together in the same pathway to break down mRNA. In vitro experiments confirmed that ALPH1 can remove phosphate groups from the end of mRNA molecules, leaving more than one phosphate group behind. This is different from other decapping enzymes, which typically remove all phosphate groups. The discovery of ALPH1 as a decapping enzyme provides new insights into the regulation of gene expression in trypanosomes and highlights the unique features of this parasite's mRNA degradation pathway.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, can trigger their conversion into insulin-producing β-like cells. This process, known as neogenesis, can occur at any age and is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass, potentially reversing diabetes. The study used conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches to investigate the role of Arx in α-cells. The results show that the loss of Arx in α-cells leads to the continuous mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine cell fate, which are then converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. This process is independent of the Pax4 gene, which was previously thought to be necessary for the conversion of α-cells into β-like cells. The study also found that the loss of Arx in α-cells is sufficient to regenerate a functional β-cell mass and reverse diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion. The findings suggest that strategies aimed at inhibiting the expression of Arx or its molecular targets/co-factors may provide new avenues for the treatment of diabetes. The study provides evidence that the sole loss of the Arx gene in α-cells is sufficient to initiate a continuous cycle of glucagon+ cell neo-formation and their conversion into β-like cells, leading to islet hypertrophy due to β-like cell hyperplasia.
Eukaryotic cells have thousands of replication origins in their genome, and re-initiation of DNA replication at these origins can lead to genomic alterations. To prevent re-initiation, cells use multiple regulatory mechanisms that reduce the activity of replication initiation proteins. However, research suggests that these mechanisms may not be uniform across all origins, and some origins may be more prone to re-initiation than others.

Studies have identified novel genetic elements, called re-initiation promoters (RIPs), that are necessary for preferential re-initiation of certain origins and can confer preferential re-initiation on other origins when the control of re-initiation is partially deregulated. These RIPs are short, AT-rich sequences that act in a distance- and sequence-dependent manner. They can overcome a block to re-initiation imposed after the Mcm2-7 helicase complex associates with origins.

The discovery of RIPs suggests that there is a local level of control in the block to re-initiation, creating a complex genomic landscape of re-replication potential. This means that some regions of the genome may be more susceptible to genomic alterations, such as those that occur in cancer cells, than others. The identification of RIPs provides new insights into the regulation of eukaryotic replication origins and highlights the importance of local control in preventing re-initiation and maintaining genome stability.
Invasive amebiasis (IA) caused by Entamoeba histolytica is a significant health concern, particularly among men who have sex with men (MSM) and those co-infected with HIV-1. A study of 170 HIV-1-infected Japanese men with IA found that the clinical presentation of the disease was similar to that in non-HIV-1-infected individuals, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high C-reactive protein (CRP) levels associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis, while treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases.

The study found that luminal treatment following metronidazole or tinidazole treatment did not reduce the recurrence of amebiasis in high-risk populations, likely due to re-infection. Recurrence was more frequent in individuals with hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibodies and those who acquired syphilis during follow-up. The study also identified various genotypes of E. histolytica in 14 patients, but found no correlation between genotype and clinical features.

The results suggest that the outcome of metronidazole and tinidazole treatment of uncomplicated amebiasis is excellent in HIV-1-infected individuals, consistent with previous reports. However, the study highlights the difficulty of preventing IA recurrence without an educational approach to prevent new amebic infections, particularly in high-risk groups such as HIV-1-infected MSM. The spread of E. histolytica in MSM beyond Asia is a concern, emphasizing the need for increased awareness and prevention efforts.
Researchers conducted a study in the Mandoul area of Chad to assess the impact of adding tsetse control to medical activities on the transmission of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). The disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and is transmitted by riverine tsetse flies. Prior to 2014, control efforts relied solely on case detection and treatment, which led to a gradual decrease in HAT cases. However, new cases continued to be detected, indicating ongoing transmission. The researchers deployed "tiny targets" that attract and kill tsetse flies in 2014, 2015, and 2016, and monitored their impact on tsetse populations and HAT incidence. The results showed a significant reduction in tsetse populations and a corresponding decrease in HAT cases. Mathematical modeling indicated that 70.4% of the reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 can be attributed to vector control, with the remaining 29.6% due to medical intervention. The study suggests that the combination of tsetse control and medical detection and treatment has played a major role in reducing HAT incidence in the Mandoul area. The researchers estimate that elimination of HAT as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 if vector control and screening continue at the present level.
A study of 1245 cases of imported strongyloidiasis in Spain found that most patients were immigrants from South America, with 66.9% coming from this region. The majority of patients were asymptomatic, but 82.2% had eosinophilia, a condition characterized by high levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. The parasite was detected in stool samples in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests were used to diagnose the remaining cases. Treatment with ivermectin was found to be more effective than albendazole in achieving a cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34. The study suggests that screening for Strongyloides stercoralis infection should be mandatory for patients coming from or traveling to endemic areas, particularly those with immunosuppressant conditions, due to the long latency of the infection and the risk of developing a severe presentation.
Researchers have found that the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used in a vaccine, known as the inoculum dose, plays a crucial role in determining the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. A higher inoculum dose can stimulate a stronger immune response, but it may also cause more severe side effects and limit the number of people who can be vaccinated in the event of a shortage. To find the optimal inoculum dose, a combination of mathematical models and experimental data can be used. A team of researchers used this approach to study the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity in mice infected with the influenza A virus and cotton rats infected with the human parainfluenza virus. They developed a mathematical model that can predict the level of immune protection and morbidity based on the inoculum dose. The results showed that the impact of inoculum dose on immune protection and morbidity can vary depending on the specific pathogen, and that increasing the inoculum dose does not always lead to better protection. The researchers propose a framework that combines mathematical models with experimental data to determine the optimal inoculum dose for a given vaccine and setting. This framework can help in the rational design of vaccines and the determination of the optimal amount of inoculum, ultimately leading to more effective and safer vaccines.
Researchers studied the expression of the hetR gene in Anabaena filaments, a type of cyanobacterium, under different conditions. The hetR gene is essential for the formation of heterocysts, specialized cells that fix nitrogen. The study found that fluctuations in hetR expression are not random, but are instead correlated between nearby cells in the filament. This correlation extends over a distance of about two to three cells. The researchers also found that the expression of hetR is influenced by the presence of other proteins, including PatS, SepJ, and HetN. These proteins play a role in regulating hetR expression and its distribution along the filament. Under nitrogen-rich conditions, the basal expression of hetR is influenced by PatS and SepJ, while under nitrogen-poor conditions, HetN also plays a role. The study highlights the importance of cell-cell communication and protein interactions in controlling the expression of hetR and the formation of heterocysts. The findings suggest that the development of heterocysts in Anabaena filaments is a complex process that involves the coordinated expression of multiple genes and proteins. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying this process and has implications for our understanding of multicellular development in cyanobacteria.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) has become the dominant strain in China, replacing genotype III (GIII), according to molecular epidemiological surveillance. A serological survey in non-vaccinated pigs confirmed this shift, with an average ratio of GI to GIII infections of 1.87. To understand the reasons behind this shift, researchers compared the replication efficiency of seven JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, in various cell cultures and young domestic ducklings. The results showed that GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII strains in chicken fibroblast cells (DF-1) and porcine iliac artery endothelial cells (PIEC), with titers reaching 22.9-225.3 fold higher than GIII strains. This enhanced replication efficiency was also observed in vivo, with GI-inoculated ducklings developing higher viremia titers and a longer viremic duration than GIII-inoculated ducklings. The 36 amino acid differences between GI and GIII viruses may be responsible for this increased replication efficiency in birds. The findings suggest that the enhanced replication of GI viruses in birds could lead to increased transmission efficiency in the birds-mosquitoes-birds enzootic transmission cycle, contributing to the JEV genotype shift.
Researchers studied the genetic network that controls the formation of biofilms by Candida albicans, a type of fungus that can cause infections. Biofilms are complex communities of microorganisms that adhere to surfaces and are difficult to treat. The network consists of six transcription factors (Bcr1, Brg1, Efg1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1) that work together to regulate biofilm formation. To understand how these factors interact, the researchers created all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network genes and analyzed their effects on biofilm formation. The results showed that the network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbations, with all six double heterozygous mutants showing altered biofilm formation. Many double heterozygous mutants were as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating that the network is highly interdependent. The researchers found that the network has properties of a "small-world" network, which is efficient but not robust. They also discovered that Tec1 is a key component of the network that is sensitive to small perturbations, and that Rob1's expression is dependent on both auto-regulation and interactions with other network factors. The study provides new insights into the functions of individual transcription factors and the role of the overall network topology in regulating biofilm formation. The findings suggest that the structure and function of the biofilm TF network allows small perturbations to be communicated through the network to regulate the expression of important genes.
Researchers studied the enzyme asparagine synthetase A (AS-A) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. AS-A is responsible for converting aspartate into asparagine, an amino acid essential for the parasite's survival. The enzyme is absent in humans, making it a potential target for antiparasitic drugs. However, previous studies suggested that AS-A is essential for the survival of another related parasite, Leishmania donovani. To investigate this, the researchers created Leishmania infantum parasites without the AS-A enzyme and tested their growth and infectivity in the lab and in animal models. Surprisingly, the parasites without AS-A grew normally and were just as infectious as those with the enzyme. Only when the parasites were grown in conditions with limited asparagine did they show a significant growth defect. This suggests that AS-A is not essential for the parasite's survival and infectivity under normal conditions. As a result, the researchers conclude that AS-A is not a suitable target for antiparasitic drugs against Leishmania infantum.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between toxocariasis, a parasitic infection caused by Toxocara worms, and epilepsy. The study included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries, involving a total of 4,740 participants, including 2,159 people with epilepsy and 2,581 without epilepsy. The analysis found a positive association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy, with a pooled odds ratio of 1.69 (95% confidence interval: 1.42-2.01). This means that people with Toxocara seropositivity were 1.69 times more likely to have epilepsy than those without the infection. The association was consistent across different types of studies, including those that used Western Blot as a diagnostic test and population-based studies. Meta-regression analysis found no significant association between covariates and the outcome. The study suggests that toxocariasis may be a risk factor for epilepsy, and that reducing the impact of Toxocara worms could help prevent the disease. The findings are based on an updated analysis of recent studies, which supported the association between Toxocara seropositivity and epilepsy, particularly in population-based studies. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the mechanisms by which toxocariasis may contribute to the development of epilepsy.
Researchers have discovered a new pathway in cells that helps them respond to DNA damage. This pathway involves a protein called ATM and a type of RNA called microRNA-335 (miR-335). When cells are exposed to radiation, ATM is activated, which leads to the downregulation of miR-335. miR-335, in turn, targets a protein called CtIP, which plays a crucial role in repairing DNA damage.

The study found that when miR-335 is overexpressed in cells, it reduces the levels of CtIP and makes the cells more sensitive to radiation. Conversely, when miR-335 is reduced, cells are better able to repair DNA damage. The researchers also found that a protein called CREB is responsible for producing miR-335, and that radiation activates ATM, which in turn reduces CREB's activity and leads to the downregulation of miR-335.

The study suggests that the ATM-CREB-miR-335-CtIP pathway plays a key role in determining how cells choose to repair DNA damage. When miR-335 is reduced, cells are more likely to use a repair process called homologous recombination repair (HRR), which is more accurate but slower. When miR-335 is overexpressed, cells are more likely to use a faster but less accurate repair process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how cells respond to DNA damage and how we can develop new treatments for cancer and other diseases.
Researchers investigated the role of mentalizing, or attributing mental states to others, in learning during social interactions. Participants played repeated games against artificial agents that differed in their level of mentalizing sophistication. The games were framed as either social or non-social, with participants believing they were either playing against another person or gambling in a casino. Results showed that participants won against the sophisticated mentalizing agents in the social framing, but lost in the non-social framing. Additionally, participants' choice sequences were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing Bayesian learning models only in the social framing. This study demonstrates the added value of mentalizing in learning during repeated social interactions and suggests that deciphering intentional behavior relies on attributing mental states to others. The findings support the "social Bayesian brain" hypothesis, which proposes that the brain assumes others are also Bayesian learners and updates recursive beliefs based on observed behavior. The study's results have implications for understanding the cognitive processes involved in social learning and the importance of mentalizing in social interactions.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FastGGM to analyze complex biological networks. These networks are made up of many variables, such as genes or proteins, that interact with each other. Traditional methods for analyzing these networks can be slow and inaccurate, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. The new algorithm, FastGGM, is faster and more accurate than existing methods. It uses a statistical model called the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) to identify relationships between variables in the network.

The researchers tested FastGGM on simulated data and found that it was several orders of magnitude faster than existing methods without losing any accuracy. They also applied the algorithm to real-world data from two studies: one on childhood asthma and one on Alzheimer's disease. The resulting networks revealed interesting interactions between genes and proteins, and the differences between healthy and diseased samples showed functional relevance to the diseases.

FastGGM has been implemented in an R package, making it available for researchers to use. The algorithm is particularly useful for analyzing large-scale biological networks, such as those involving tens of thousands of genes or proteins. By providing a fast and accurate way to analyze these networks, FastGGM has the potential to become a powerful tool for understanding complex biological systems and identifying new targets for disease treatment.
Researchers studied how the striatum, a part of the brain involved in movement and learning, responds to changing signals from the cortex. They created a computer model of a small group of neurons in the striatum, called medium spiny neurons (MSNs), to see how they interact with each other and with signals from the cortex. The model showed that when the connections between MSNs are too strong, the network becomes too stable and doesn't respond well to changes in the cortex. On the other hand, when the connections are too weak, the network becomes too unstable and doesn't respond consistently. However, when the connections are at a certain optimal level, the network responds well to changes in the cortex and generates activity patterns that are specific to the stimulus and last for a long time. This optimal level of connectivity is similar to what is found in the real brain. The researchers also found that the size of the inhibitory signals between MSNs is important for this optimal response. They suggest that the striatum is optimized to generate activity patterns that are specific to the stimulus and last for a long time, but not so stable that it can't respond to changes in the cortex, and not so unstable that it can't respond consistently.
Researchers have discovered a new link between polarized exocytosis and endocytosis in yeast cells. Polarized exocytosis is the process by which cells transport membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, while endocytosis retrieves these components before they can diffuse away. The study found that the yeast Rab GTPase Sec4p plays a crucial role in coupling polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization, which in turn induces endocytosis. Sec4p binds to Las17/Bee1p, a protein involved in actin patch assembly, and Sla1p and Sla2p during actin patch formation. Mutations that inactivate Sec4p or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2p inhibit actin patch formation, while the activating sec4-Q79L mutation accelerates patch assembly. In vitro assays showed that GTPγS-Sec4p overrides Sla1p inhibition of Las17p-dependent actin nucleation. The study suggests that Sec4p relocates along the plasma membrane from polarized sites of exocytic vesicle fusion to nascent sites of endocytosis, promoting actin polymerization and triggering compensatory endocytosis. This process controls surface expansion and refines cell polarization.
Acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice is a widely used model for studying drug-induced liver injury in humans. Researchers have been trying to understand the underlying mechanisms of this injury, but a clear explanation has been elusive. One theory, known as the NAPQI zonation hypothesis, suggests that differences in the formation of a toxic metabolite called NAPQI within the liver lobules are responsible for the injury. However, this theory has been difficult to test in mice due to the complexity of the liver's internal environment.

To overcome this challenge, researchers used computer simulations, or "virtual hepatocytes," to model the behavior of liver cells. These simulations allowed them to test the NAPQI zonation hypothesis and explore alternative explanations for the injury. The results showed that zonation of NAPQI formation alone is not enough to explain the injury, and that other factors must also be involved.

The researchers then proposed two additional features that could contribute to the injury: a decrease in glutathione levels and a decrease in the ability to repair mitochondrial damage, both of which occur in the direction towards the central vein of the liver lobules. When both of these features were included in the simulation, the results matched the observed patterns of liver injury in mice. This merged mechanism provides a more complete explanation for the injury and can be used to predict the response of different mouse strains to acetaminophen.
Researchers studied 51 children born to mothers infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The goal was to understand why some newborns can't be diagnosed with the disease immediately after birth. The study found that only babies with high levels of the parasite in their blood can be diagnosed within the first month of life using a standard test called the INP micromethod. However, 22 out of 51 children had parasite levels too low to be detected by this method. These children were only diagnosed later, around 1 year old, through a blood test that detects antibodies against the parasite. The study also found that the parasite levels in these children were very low, ranging from 5 to 20 parasites per milliliter of blood. The researchers isolated the parasite from the blood of 19 children and found that most belonged to a specific genetic lineage. The study suggests that the current method of diagnosing Chagas disease in newborns may not be sensitive enough, and that more sensitive methods are needed to detect the parasite in children with low levels of infection. This is important because prompt treatment can cure the disease, but delayed diagnosis can lead to long-term health problems. The study provides new insights into the transmission of Chagas disease from mother to child and highlights the need for improved diagnostic methods to ensure early detection and treatment.
Researchers have developed a simplified model to predict the growth rate and cellular composition of Escherichia coli (E. coli) based on its genome. The model assumes that E. coli is growing in a constant environment with plenty of resources and is in a state of balanced exponential growth. The researchers applied this model to data from experiments where the growth rate and rRNA-to-protein ratio were measured in seven E. coli strains with different numbers of rRNA operons, ranging from one to seven. The results showed that the growth rate decreased significantly in strains with fewer than six copies of the rRNA operon. The model was able to reproduce these findings and suggested that the volume fraction of macromolecules inside E. coli is not fixed when the rRNA operon copy number is varied. The model also predicted that increasing the rRNA operon copy number beyond seven would lead to a densely packed cytoplasm, which would weaken the binding affinities of molecules and not significantly increase the growth rate. This prediction is consistent with other experiments that showed that increasing the rRNA operon copy number beyond seven does not lead to a substantial increase in growth rate. The model suggests that changing the rRNA operon copy number of wild-type E. coli cells growing in a constant rich environment does not substantially increase their growth rate.
Researchers have identified a protein called RSM1 in Arabidopsis plants that plays a crucial role in seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity. ABA is a hormone that helps plants respond to stress and regulate growth. RSM1 interacts with two other proteins, HY5 and HYH, to modulate seed germination and seedling development in response to ABA and salinity. The study found that down-regulating or up-regulating RSM1 expression alters the sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol. The researchers also discovered that HY5 and HYH regulate RSM1 expression by binding to its promoter. Genetic analyses revealed that RSM1 mediates multiple functions of HY5 in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses, including seed germination, post-germination development, and seedling tolerance to salinity. RSM1 and HY5/HYH may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. The study also found that RSM1 binds to the promoter of ABI5, a gene involved in ABA signaling, and stimulates HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. This suggests that RSM1, HY5/HYH, and ABI5 may converge on the ABI5 promoter to regulate its expression and downstream genes involved in ABA and abiotic stress responses.
Mitochondrial complex I is a crucial component of the respiratory chain, responsible for transferring electrons from NADH to ubiquinone and pumping protons from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. This process is essential for energy production in cells. However, defects in complex I have been linked to various degenerative disorders, including neurodegenerative diseases and aging.

Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the structure of complex I through X-ray analysis, revealing that the redox reactions occur in the hydrophilic peripheral arm, far from the membrane domain. Despite this, the mechanism of proton pumping in the membrane arm remains unclear. A recent study aimed to shed light on this process by deleting a small accessory subunit of the Yarrowia complex I, resulting in a stable subcomplex called nb8mΔ.

Analysis of the subunit composition of the holo and subcomplex revealed that two subunits, ND4 and ND5, which are homologous to bacterial Na+/H+ antiporters, were missing in nb8mΔ. Surprisingly, the subcomplex still pumped protons, albeit at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. These findings suggest that the membrane arm of complex I contains two functionally distinct pump modules connected in series by a long helical transmission element. This discovery provides new insights into the complex mechanism of proton pumping in mitochondrial complex I.
Research has shown that fever, a regulated increase in body temperature, plays a role in modulating the immune response to infection. However, the effect of febrile temperatures on the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens has not been well understood. A recent study investigated this process in vitro, using Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) to examine the binding of antibodies to malarial and dengue antigens at different temperatures.

The study found that at 40°C, the affinity of the antibody-antigen complexes increased significantly compared to physiological (37°C) or pathophysiological temperatures (42°C). This increase in affinity was observed in both ITC and ELISA measurements. The researchers also found that thermal equilibration of the protein partners prior to measurement further increased their binding affinity.

The study suggests that fever may play a positive and adaptive role in enhancing the immune response to infection by increasing the binding affinity of antibodies to antigens. The findings also highlight the importance of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity, particularly in cases where limited amounts of samples are available. The study's results have implications for the development of new treatments and diagnostic tools for infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.
Researchers studied how cells control the flow of fluids within their outer layer, known as the actomyosin cortex. This flow is crucial for cell shape changes and development. They created a computer model of the actomyosin network, which is made up of actin filaments and myosin motors. The model included key features such as asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover.

The study found that the production and dissipation of contractile stress in the network depend on cross-link dynamics and filament turnover. The researchers discovered that filament turnover is necessary to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady-state flow in response to external stress. They also found that steady-state stress increases with filament lifetime up to a certain point, then decreases. Effective viscosity, which is a measure of resistance to flow, increases with filament lifetime up to a certain point, then becomes independent of filament lifetime and dependent on cross-link dynamics.

The study identified multiple regimes of steady-state flow, characterized by different dependencies on filament turnover and other network parameters. The researchers found that when filament lifetimes are shorter than certain characteristic times, the dependencies of effective viscosity and steady-state stress on filament turnover cancel each other out, making flow speed insensitive to filament turnover. The study provides a framework for understanding how cells control cortical flow through local control of network remodeling.
Researchers identified a genetic locus, GSQ11, in Arabidopsis thaliana that makes seedlings insensitive to high levels of glucose and fructose. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis revealed that GSQ11 is associated with the ANAC060 gene, which encodes a transcription factor. The Col allele of ANAC060 confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele. Further analysis showed that a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Col ANAC060 allele affects the splicing pattern of the gene, resulting in a truncated protein that lacks a transmembrane domain. This truncated protein is localized to the nucleus, where it attenuates abscisic acid (ABA) signaling. ABA is a hormone involved in sugar signaling, and the reduced ABA sensitivity in Col ANAC060 lines results in sugar insensitivity. The researchers found that ABI4, a transcription factor involved in ABA signaling, directly binds to the GSQ11/ANAC060 promoter to activate its expression. However, the truncated Col ANAC060 protein reduces ABI4 expression and ABA induction, creating a negative feedback loop that results in sugar insensitivity. This study provides new insights into the sugar-ABA signaling cascade and the role of ANAC060 in regulating sugar sensitivity in Arabidopsis seedlings.
Researchers studied how the molecule cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) helps control the behavior of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria. They found that a protein called HsbD works with the HptB pathway to control biofilm formation and motility. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that stick together, while motility refers to the ability of bacteria to move. The HptB pathway is a network of proteins that helps P. aeruginosa decide whether to form biofilms or move around. HsbD is a type of enzyme that produces c-di-GMP, a molecule that sends signals within the cell. The researchers discovered that HsbD interacts with other proteins in the HptB pathway, including HsbA, to control biofilm formation and motility. They also found that HsbD and another enzyme, SadC, have different effects on the HptB pathway, suggesting that they work at different points in the signaling network. The researchers propose that HsbD acts locally at the cell pole, where it produces c-di-GMP, and that it interacts with SadC in a hierarchical order within the Gac/Rsm regulatory network. This network is important for controlling biofilm formation in P. aeruginosa. Overall, the study provides new insights into how c-di-GMP signaling works in P. aeruginosa and how it helps the bacteria decide whether to form biofilms or move around.
Researchers investigated how humans learn and generalize visuomotor mappings, which are associations between visual cues and motor responses. Participants performed a rapid target-pointing task while visual feedback was manipulated to require different visuomotor mappings depending on the target shape. The target shapes were morphed between spiky and circular shapes, and participants learned to associate each shape with a specific motor response. After training, participants were tested on target shapes that had not been learned previously, and their performance was compared to a Bayesian learning model. The results showed that participants applied the mapping corresponding to the trained shape that was most similar to the current one, consistent with the Bayesian learning model. The model predicts that learning should slow down with increased numbers of training pairs, which was confirmed by the results. The study found a good correspondence between the Bayesian learning model and the empirical results, suggesting that this model may be a possible mechanism for learning multiple visuomotor mappings. The researchers also found that participants were able to extract the linear relationship between target shape and visuomotor mapping and generalize accordingly. However, this explicit awareness of the cues' role was necessary for learning the associations.
Researchers studied how the inferior olivary nucleus, a part of the brain, sends signals to the cerebellum. The inferior olivary nucleus has two main inputs to the cerebellum: mossy fibers and climbing fibers. Climbing fibers are thought to be related to timing of motor commands and motor learning. When a climbing fiber is activated, it causes a large action potential in the cerebellar Purkinje cells, silencing them for a short time.

The researchers used a computer model to study how the size of the climbing fiber burst is determined. They found that the size of the burst is related to the phase of the sub-threshold membrane potential oscillation of the olivary cell. This means that the timing of the oscillation affects the size of the burst. However, this relationship is limited and the charge flow between the soma and dendrite of the olivary cell is a major factor in determining the size of the climbing fiber burst.

The researchers also found that phenomena such as cell ensemble synchrony can affect the size of the climbing fiber burst through dendrodendritic gap-junctional coupling between olivary cells. This suggests that the inferior olivary nucleus can transmit more information to the cerebellum than previously thought. The study's findings have implications for understanding how the cerebellum processes information and how it is involved in motor learning and timing.
Researchers have developed a computational model of liver iron metabolism to better understand how the liver regulates iron levels in the body. Iron is essential for life, but excessive levels can be toxic. The liver plays a crucial role in maintaining safe iron levels through a complex biochemical network involving iron absorption, transport, storage, and regulation. A detailed map of iron metabolism has been created, but a quantitative understanding of how its components interact to produce tight regulation has been elusive. The new model includes the core regulatory components and was constructed based on known mechanisms of regulation and their kinetic properties. It was validated by comparing its results with previously published physiological data and was able to reproduce multiple experimental findings. The model was used to simulate a time course of iron metabolism after an oral dose of iron and recreated the dynamics and time scale of the system's response. It was also used to simulate a disease state, haemochromatosis, by altering a single reaction parameter that mimics a human haemochromatosis gene mutation. The simulation provided a quantitative understanding of the liver iron overload that arises in this disease. The model supports the understanding of the liver as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modeling, including simulations to identify valuable drug targets and design of experiments to improve knowledge of the system.
Researchers have developed a computer model to simulate the process of molecular transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), a crucial gateway for material exchange between the nucleus and cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells. The model, called a coarse-grained model, takes into account the interactions between proteins called karyopherins (kaps) and the FG-repeat domains on the NPC. These interactions are thought to play a key role in regulating the transport of molecules across the NPC.

The model predicts that it takes around 2.6 milliseconds for a 15-nanometer cargo complex to pass through the NPC, and that the cargo is primarily attached to the channel wall as it interacts with the FG-layer. The model also suggests that the kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic and fast, allowing for efficient transport through the NPC. Additionally, the model shows that almost all eight hydrophobic binding spots on the kap-β protein are occupied simultaneously during transport.

The researchers tested the model by simulating the transport of cargo complexes of different sizes and found that it accurately predicted the first-passage times for 9-nanometer and 20-nanometer cargo complexes. The model was also able to simulate the passive transport of small cargos, which are known to diffuse freely across the NPC. Overall, the coarse-grained model provides new insights into the molecular events that occur during nucleocytoplasmic transport and can be used as a foundation for further research into this complex process.
Researchers have developed a new method to determine the optimal dose of a pathogen required to infect 50% of nonhuman primates (NHPs) in experiments. This method, known as the AID50, is crucial for testing interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. Using too high or too low a challenge dose can lead to false negative results and waste resources.

The new protocol minimizes the number of animals and resources needed to determine the AID50. It involves iterative exposures of cohorts of animals to a dilution of the pathogen stock, adjusting the dose between each round to achieve 50% infection. The method is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model, but is most critical for NHP models where animal use must be minimized.

On average, the protocol requires 15 animals, 3 rounds of exposure, and results in an estimate of the AID50 within 40% of the true value. The method can be used to calculate other challenge doses, such as AID80, from the same data. By following this protocol, researchers can achieve statistically significant and biologically meaningful results while using fewer animals and resources. This is particularly important for NHP models, where ethical considerations mandate the minimization of animal use.
Researchers studied the auditory neuron AN2 in crickets to understand how it adapts to changes in sound stimuli. They found that the neuron's response to sound intensity changes over time, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds. This means that the neuron's response to low-intensity sounds decreases over time, while its response to high-intensity sounds increases.

The researchers tested two competing theories to explain this adaptation: infomax and selective coding. Infomax predicts that the neuron should maximize the information it conveys about the entire range of sound intensities, while selective coding suggests that the neuron should focus on the loudest sounds and suppress background noise.

To test these theories, the researchers created sound stimuli with multiple peaks in their amplitude distribution, mimicking real-world sounds with multiple sources. They found that the neuron's response curve changed in a way that was not consistent with either theory. Specifically, the neuron's response to the loudest sounds did not increase as predicted by selective coding, and the amount of information conveyed about the entire range of sound intensities actually decreased.

The researchers used Bayesian data analysis to quantify the changes in the neuron's response curve and found that the slopes of the curve decreased and the absolute response thresholds increased. This suggests that adaptation in the AN2 neuron reduces the amount of information it conveys about sound stimuli, particularly for low-intensity sounds.
Researchers have discovered a new way that prions, misfolded proteins that cause diseases such as mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, interact with normal brain cells. Previous studies suggested that two specific regions of the prion protein, called polybasic domains, play a key role in this interaction. To investigate this further, scientists created mutant prion proteins that lacked one or both of these domains. They found that these mutant prions could still bind to and convert normal brain cells into prions, but they were less able to cause disease. This suggests that the polybasic domains are not essential for prion propagation, but may be required for the prions to cause disease. The researchers also found that the mutant prions could seed the conversion of normal brain cells into prions, even though they were less able to cause disease. This indicates that there may be multiple ways for prions to interact with normal brain cells and cause disease. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of prion disease and may lead to the development of new treatments. The findings suggest that the interaction between prions and normal brain cells is more complex than previously thought, and that targeting the polybasic domains may not be the most effective way to prevent prion disease.
Researchers developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from behavioral time-series data. They applied this framework to study the thermotactic behavior of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), a type of worm, in response to temperature changes. The study found that fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative to navigate a thermal gradient, employing two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). DM allowed the worms to efficiently reach specific temperatures, while IM involved moving along a constant temperature. In contrast, starved worms used only the absolute temperature to avoid the cultivation temperature. The researchers also investigated the neural basis of these strategies by applying their method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. The IRL-based approach was found to be useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making in other organisms. The study demonstrated the effectiveness of the IRL framework in uncovering the underlying mechanisms of animal behavior, providing new insights into the decision-making processes of C. elegans.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Chrysochromulina tobin, a type of haptophyte algae, and analyzed its transcriptome over a 24-hour period. Haptophytes play a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems, contributing to carbon sequestration, forming harmful blooms, and serving as a food source for various aquatic organisms. Despite their importance, the nuclear genome of only one haptophyte, Emiliania huxleyi, has been previously sequenced.

The Chrysochromulina tobin genome is relatively small, compact, and encodes approximately 16,777 genes. The study found that genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression over the day-night cycle. The genome also contains a unique hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase gene complex, as well as genes for anti-microbial peptides and proteins involved in removing toxic compounds.

The researchers identified a new type of xanthorhodopsin, a light-sensitive protein, and two "red" ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) activases that are shared across many algal lineages. These findings provide new insights into the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of haptophytes. The study suggests that the Chrysochromulina tobin genome will be useful for understanding the fundamental metabolic processes of haptophytes, including the formation of harmful algal blooms. This information can also support commercial endeavors such as aquaculture, nutraceuticals, and biofuel production.
Researchers studied the role of three tumor suppressor genes, Rb, Brca1, and p53, in the development of triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer is a type of cancer that lacks receptors for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2, making it harder to treat. The study used mouse models to inactivate these genes in mammary epithelial cells and observed that the combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways suppressed the normal process of cell death that occurs during mammary involution, or the shrinkage of the mammary gland after weaning.

The researchers found that concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelial cells had an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposed highly penetrant, metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors were poorly differentiated and had histologic features common among human Brca1-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses demonstrated that the tumors shared attributes of both Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures, two molecular subtypes encompassed by the broader, triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.

The study's findings suggest that the combined inactivation of Rb, Brca1, and p53 pathways is sufficient to mimic several aspects of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer, including rapid tumor progression, poor differentiation, distant metastasis, necrosis, metaplasia, and genomic instability. These results highlight the importance of understanding the complex interplay between these tumor suppressor genes in the development of triple-negative breast cancer.
Aedes aegypti, the primary vector of dengue, is a major public health concern globally. To control and prevent dengue transmission, accurate predictions of vector populations are essential. Researchers conducted a study in rural Kamphaeng Phet, Thailand, to develop an ecological model of Aedes aegypti pupal production. They collected 84,840 samples of water-holding containers from 2004 to 2007 and used regression modeling to assess the effect of larval development site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity.

The study found that the number of suitable larval development sites and their density in the environment were the primary determinants of the distribution and abundance of Aedes aegypti pupae. The productivity of most container types increased significantly as habitat density increased. A two-part modeling structure, called a hurdle model, was used to account for the large number of zeroes and overdispersion present in pupal population counts.

The results suggest that an ecological approach, accounting for development site density, is appropriate for predicting Aedes aegypti population levels and developing efficient vector control programs. The study's findings can inform the design of effective vector interventions and contribute to a more cohesive understanding of Aedes aegypti population dynamics. The research highlights the importance of considering the spatial density of larval development sites in controlling Aedes aegypti populations and preventing dengue transmission.
Researchers have discovered a key mechanism by which the gut communicates with the brain to regulate behavior and development in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The study found that the Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a crucial role in integrating information about food quality and quantity with external cues such as temperature and pheromones. TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate the expression of two key genes, daf-7 and daf-28, which reflect the worm's feeding status. This information is then transmitted to the brain, influencing the worm's decision to enter a dormant state called the dauer larval stage or to continue growing and reproducing.

In adult worms, TORC2 also regulates foraging behavior in response to food availability. The researchers found that genetic variation affects the worm's response to food, and identified specific genetic loci associated with these traits. The study suggests that TORC2 acts as a hub for communication between the gut and the brain, allowing the worm to adjust its behavior in response to changes in its environment and internal state. This research provides new insights into the complex interactions between the gut, brain, and environment in regulating behavior and development. The findings have implications for our understanding of how animals integrate internal and external cues to make decisions about growth, reproduction, and survival.
Researchers have identified specific DNA sequences that control the expression of genes in embryonic stem cells, which are cells that have the ability to develop into any cell type in the body. These sequences, called cis-regulatory elements, play a crucial role in maintaining the cells' pluripotency and ability to self-renew. The researchers used a novel computational algorithm called CompMoby to analyze the DNA sequences of mouse and human embryonic stem cells and identified several conserved motifs that are active in these cells. These motifs were found to be involved in various biological processes, including transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair.

The researchers validated the activity of these motifs in mouse and human embryonic stem cells and showed that they can act as enhancers, which are regions of DNA that increase the expression of nearby genes. They also identified a transcription factor called NF-Y that specifically binds to one of the motifs and is required for the proliferation of embryonic stem cells. The study provides new insights into the transcriptional regulatory networks of pluripotent cells and suggests that this approach can be applied to understanding transcriptional networks in other mammalian species. The findings have implications for the development of new strategies for directing the differentiation of embryonic stem cells and reprogramming somatic cells, which could lead to new treatments for various diseases.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the structure of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) N0-P complex, a crucial component in the replication of non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. The N0-P complex consists of the nucleoprotein (N) and the phosphoprotein (P), which are essential for the continuous supply of N in the form of a complex. A soluble, heterodimeric complex between a variant of VSV N lacking its 21 N-terminal residues (NΔ21) and a peptide of 60 amino acids (P60) encompassing the molecular recognition element (MoRE) of P that binds RNA-free N (N0) was studied. The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form and was solved at 3.0 Å resolution, revealing how the MoRE folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and N polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering experiments and NMR spectroscopy confirmed the binding of the MoRE and indicated that its flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure of the complex suggests a mechanism for the initiation of viral RNA synthesis and provides insights into the encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA. The study demonstrates that the reconstituted NΔ21-P60 complex is a suitable model for the viral N0-P complex and reveals the molecular mechanisms by which the N0-binding MoRE of P attaches to N.
Researchers studied how the fly's visual system processes motion and found that electrical synapses, called gap junctions, play a crucial role in this process. Gap junctions allow cells in the vertical system network to communicate with each other quickly and efficiently. By analyzing a model of this network, the researchers discovered that the presence of gap junctions enables the system to accurately encode the axis of rotation of the fly's motion within 10 milliseconds. This encoding efficiency is near-optimal, meaning it is as good as it can be given the limitations of the visual input.

The researchers also found that a subset of cells in the vertical system, known as the VS 5-6-7 triplet, encodes motion more efficiently than the entire network. This subpopulation is connected to downstream pathways and is responsible for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. The presence of gap junctions in this subpopulation is necessary for efficient encoding of motion.

The study suggests that gap junctions may be a common mechanism for improving information transmission in other neuronal systems. Gap junctions have been found to improve information transmission in the retina and in neocortical L2/3 inhibitory interneuron networks. The researchers' findings provide new insights into how specific network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a common cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children, but it can also lead to severe neurological diseases, including fatal cases. Researchers have identified human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry and replication in leukocytes. PSGL-1 is a sialomucin that serves as a high-affinity counterreceptor for selectins and mediates leukocyte rolling on the endothelium. The interaction between PSGL-1 and P-selectin requires sulfation of at least one of three clustered tyrosines and an adjacent O-glycan expressing sialyl Lewis x in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1. To understand the molecular basis of the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction, researchers generated a series of PSGL-1 mutants and identified the post-translational modifications critical for binding of PSGL-1 to EV71. They found that O-glycosylation on T57 is not necessary for PSGL-1 binding to EV71, but tyrosine sulfation in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 is crucial for the interaction. An inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocked the PSGL-1-EV71 interaction and inhibited PSGL-1-mediated viral replication of EV71 in Jurkat T cells in a dose-dependent manner. These findings suggest that tyrosine sulfation, but not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal region of PSGL-1 facilitates virus entry and replication of EV71 in leukocytes.
Researchers have been searching for effective treatments for leishmaniasis, a serious disease caused by a parasite that affects millions of people worldwide. Current treatments can be toxic and often lead to resistant strains, making them ineffective in the long run. Scientists have discovered that inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have anti-pathogen properties and may offer a new approach to treating leishmaniasis. In this study, researchers tested three mTOR inhibitors - rapamycin, GSK-2126458, and KU-0063794 - on mice infected with the parasite Leishmania major. The results showed that treatment with rapamycin or GSK-2126458 significantly reduced the parasite load and footpad swelling in the mice, while KU-0063794 had no effect. The researchers also found that the treatment altered the immune response of the mice, shifting it towards a "Th1" response, which is more effective against the parasite. The study suggests that mTOR inhibitors, particularly rapamycin and GSK-2126458, may be used to treat leishmaniasis by modulating the immune system. The researchers propose that these inhibitors could also be used as adjuvants to enhance the effectiveness of vaccines against the parasite.
Researchers studied the process of natural transformation in Neisseria species, where bacteria take up free DNA and incorporate it into their genomes. To understand how this process works, they focused on the interaction between the DNA uptake sequence (DUS) and its receptor, ComP. They found that ComP is the receptor for DUS in Neisseria species and that it plays a crucial role in the transformation process.

The study showed that the presence of DUS enhances transformation in Neisseria meningitidis, and this enhancement is entirely dependent on ComP. ComP also controls transformation in the absence of DUS. The researchers found that the inner bases of DUS are essential for recognition by ComP and transformation, while peripheral bases are less important. They also discovered that naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisseria commensals, which differ from DUS by only one or two bases, are impaired for transformation of N. meningitidis.

The study confirmed that a similar mechanism is used by all Neisseria species to promote transformation by their own or closely related DNA. The findings shed light on the molecular events involved in the earliest step of natural transformation and reveal an elegant mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche. This research provides new insights into the process of natural transformation and its role in generating genetic diversity through horizontal gene transfer.
Researchers studied the process of cell division in fission yeast, focusing on how a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and a cell wall structure called the division septum are formed. They found that two proteins, Pxl1 and Bgs1, work together to maintain the stability of the CAR and ensure proper septum formation. Pxl1 helps keep the CAR anchored to the cell membrane, while Bgs1 is responsible for synthesizing a key component of the septum. When either Pxl1 or Bgs1 is missing, the CAR fails to contract and the septum is not formed, leading to problems with cell division. The researchers also discovered that another protein, Cdc15, plays a role in helping Pxl1 and Bgs1 work together. Without Cdc15, the CAR becomes unstable and the septum is not formed. The study suggests that Pxl1 acts as a "mechanosensor" that helps convert the contraction of the CAR into a signal that activates the enzymes responsible for forming the septum. The findings provide new insights into the complex process of cell division and highlight the importance of cooperation between different proteins in ensuring proper cell growth and division. Overall, the study demonstrates that Pxl1, Bgs1, and Cdc15 are essential for maintaining the stability of the CAR and forming the septum during cytokinesis in fission yeast.
A recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, occurred in Bahrain in 2010 and 2011. To investigate the outbreak, researchers used high-resolution genotyping and whole-genome sequencing to analyze B. mallei isolates from infected horses and a camel. The results suggest that the outbreak was caused by two different B. mallei strains, indicating multiple introductions of the disease into the region. The strains from the Bahrain outbreak were found to be more closely related to B. mallei isolated from horses in the United Arab Emirates in 2004 than to other B. mallei strains, suggesting repeated importation of the disease from similar geographic sources. The close relationship between the Dubai/UAE B. mallei populations may indicate a common geographic origin that has yet to be identified. The recent emergence of glanders, combined with global horse trading, poses a new risk for human infections. The study's findings provide evidence of the complex epidemiology of B. mallei and highlight the need for further research into the natural genetic variability and outbreak dynamics of the disease.
Researchers studied 43 patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in Colombia who did not respond to treatment with the medication meglumine antimoniate, also known as Glucantime. The study aimed to identify the clinical and parasitological features of these patients. The majority of the patients (95.4%) were infected with Leishmania braziliensis, a parasite species known to be resistant to treatment.

The study found that 35% of the parasites isolated from the patients showed a significant decrease in susceptibility to Glucantime. The size of the lesions and the infectivity of the parasites were negatively correlated with the decline in Glucantime susceptibility. This means that patients with larger lesions and more infectious parasites were less likely to respond to the treatment.

The study also found that Leishmania braziliensis was the main parasite species associated with treatment failure or relapse. The researchers suggest that a second round of treatment with pentavalent antimonial derivatives, such as Glucantime, may not be effective for patients with ACL caused by Leishmania braziliensis.

The study's findings have implications for the treatment of ACL in Colombia, where the majority of cases are caused by Leishmania braziliensis. The results suggest that alternative treatments may be needed for patients who do not respond to Glucantime.
Researchers have discovered a connection between the production of siderophores and a genotoxin called colibactin in the bacteria Escherichia coli. Siderophores are molecules that help the bacteria scavenge for iron, an essential nutrient. Colibactin is a toxin that can damage DNA and contribute to the bacteria's virulence. The researchers found that a single enzyme, called ClbA, can contribute to the production of both siderophores and colibactin. This enzyme is encoded by the pks island, a genetic region that is associated with the high pathogenicity island (HPI) in highly virulent E. coli strains. The HPI carries the gene cluster required for the production of yersiniabactin, another type of siderophore. The researchers demonstrated that ClbA can substitute for another enzyme, EntD, which is necessary for the production of enterobactin and salmochelins, two other types of siderophores. Inactivation of both EntD and ClbA abolished the virulence of E. coli in a mouse sepsis model. The study suggests that the association of the pks island with the HPI has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because ClbA can contribute to the synthesis of both the genotoxin and siderophores. This finding highlights the complex regulatory interaction of various virulence features in E. coli and has implications for the development of anti-virulence therapy strategies.
Researchers have developed a new probabilistic model for calculating the probability of a multiple sequence alignment given a phylogenetic tree and an evolutionary model. This model accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, which are not considered in widely used phylogenetic models. The new model is based on a continuous Markov process and assumes that insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. The researchers applied this model to phylogenetic tree inference by extending the program dnaml in phylip, a widely used tool for phylogenetic analysis. The extended program, called dnamlε, was tested on simulated data and real ribosomal RNA alignments using standard benchmarking methods and a new "concordance test" benchmark. The results showed that dnamlε improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps, while retaining the computational efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm. The new model also allows for the integration of evolutionary modeling into probabilistic models used for other sequence analysis problems, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs).
Researchers investigated how the body's immune system responds to the Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV), which causes cold sores and genital herpes. They found that immune cells called Langerhans cells (LCs) in the skin's outer layer are initially infected by the virus. These infected LCs then die and are engulfed by other immune cells called dermal dendritic cells (DCs) in the skin's deeper layer. The dermal DCs then carry the virus or its antigens to the lymph nodes, where they can trigger an immune response.

The study used human skin samples, including foreskin explants and biopsies from genital herpes lesions, to observe the interaction between LCs and dermal DCs. They found that infected LCs formed clusters with dermal DCs and were engulfed by them, allowing the virus or its antigens to be transferred. This process, called viral antigen relay, is crucial for the immune system to recognize and respond to the virus.

The researchers also isolated LCs and dermal DCs from skin samples and infected them with HSV in the lab. They found that infected LCs underwent apoptosis (cell death) and were engulfed by dermal DCs, confirming the viral antigen relay process. This study provides new insights into how the immune system responds to HSV and suggests that targeting dermal DCs with vaccines or immunotherapies could be an effective way to prevent or treat HSV infections.
Researchers studied how Leishmania parasites, which cause a disease called leishmaniasis, interact with host cells called macrophages. They used a technique called multidimensional imaging to observe the behavior of the parasites and their host cells in real-time. The study focused on two types of Leishmania parasites, L. major and L. amazonensis, which have different characteristics.

The researchers found that L. major parasites live in small, tight-fitting vacuoles within the host cells, while L. amazonensis parasites live in larger, more dynamic vacuoles. They observed that the vacuoles containing L. amazonensis parasites can expand and fuse with other vacuoles, allowing the parasites to grow and multiply. In contrast, the vacuoles containing L. major parasites undergo a process called fission, where they divide into two smaller vacuoles.

The researchers also used a fluorescent probe called Lysotracker to track the movement of acidic vesicles within the host cells. They found that the number of acidic vesicles decreases as the vacuoles containing the parasites grow and divide. This suggests that the host cells are providing the parasites with the necessary resources to grow and multiply.

The study provides new insights into the behavior of Leishmania parasites and their host cells, and could have implications for the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis. The use of multidimensional imaging allowed the researchers to observe the parasites and their host cells in unprecedented detail, providing a more complete understanding of the complex interactions between these two organisms.
Researchers have discovered that the structure of chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes, plays a crucial role in the process of gene conversion, a type of homologous recombination that helps maintain and alter genomic structure. Using the chicken B cell line DT40 as a model, scientists found that the immunoglobulin Vλ pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin, indicating an open and accessible structure.

To investigate the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion, the researchers used a regulatable experimental system in which the heterochromatin protein HP1 was tethered to a specific region of the pseudo-Vλ donor array. By doing so, they found that HP1 diminished histone acetylation within the pseudo-Vλ array and altered the outcome of Vλ diversification, leading to an increase in nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations.

These results suggest that chromatin structure regulates homology-directed repair, and that histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences. The study also has practical implications for gene therapy, as it suggests that permissive structure at the donor will be an important design parameter in developing donor genes for therapeutic applications. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the role of chromatin structure in regulating gene conversion and homologous recombination, and highlight the importance of considering chromatin structure in the development of gene therapy strategies.
Researchers studied how the cerebellum, a part of the brain that helps us adjust our movements, learns from mistakes. They tested monkeys in a task that required them to make quick eye movements, called saccades. The cerebellum is thought to learn from the difference between what we want to do and what we actually do, known as error information. This error information is believed to come from two types of nerve fibers: climbing fibers and parallel fibers. Climbing fibers are thought to provide instant error information, while parallel fibers make lasting changes in the brain cells that help us adjust our movements.

However, previous studies have shown conflicting results about the role of climbing fibers in motor learning. In this study, the researchers found that climbing fibers not only provide instant error information but also store information about past errors. This stored information is then used to improve future movements. The researchers observed a "signature" of the error in the climbing fiber signals at the time of the mistake and again before the next movement, suggesting that the climbing fibers play a more active role in motor learning than previously thought. This finding challenges the idea that climbing fibers only provide instant error information and do not contribute to long-term learning. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how the cerebellum learns and adapts to new situations.
Researchers have made a breakthrough in understanding a devastating neurodegenerative disease called Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). They used a yeast model to study the effects of a protein called TDP-43, which is often found in the brains of people with ALS. The study found that when TDP-43 is overexpressed, it causes cells to become misshapen and reduces the ability of the cell's waste management system to break down damaged proteins. However, when another protein called Sis1 is overexpressed, it counteracts the negative effects of TDP-43. Sis1 is a type of molecular chaperone that helps other proteins fold correctly. The researchers also found that a similar protein in mammals, called DNAJB1, has the same protective effect against TDP-43 toxicity in rodent neurons. This suggests that Sis1 and its homologues may have the potential to be used as a treatment for ALS. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of ALS and highlight the importance of molecular chaperones in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation. Further research is needed to determine if Sis1 and DNAJB1 can effectively extend neuronal survival in people with ALS.
Researchers in Brazil studied the parasite load and genetic diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, in 65 patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of the country. The study aimed to investigate the association between the parasite's genetic subtypes, known as discrete typing units (DTUs), and the clinical manifestations of the disease. The researchers used a molecular typing and parasite load quantification method to analyze blood samples from the patients. The results showed that 53.8% of the patients had a positive parasite load, with 30.7% having the indeterminate form and 23.1% having the cardiac form of the disease. The parasite load was significantly higher in patients over 70 years old. The researchers were able to identify the DTU in 80% of the patients with a positive parasite load, with the most common DTUs being TcVI, TcII, and mixed infection TcVI+TcII. The study found that patients infected with TcII had higher parasite loads compared to those infected with TcVI. Additionally, patients infected with TcII were less likely to develop chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy (CCC) compared to those infected with TcVI or TcV. The study's findings contribute to the understanding of the epidemiology of T. cruzi DTUs in Brazil and highlight the importance of age and DTU infection in determining parasite load and disease progression.
A study conducted in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011 aimed to investigate the prevalence of rabies in bats. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for the rabies virus (RABV). The results showed a low prevalence of RABV detection among all collected bats, at 0.3%. However, two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) were found to be infected with RABV, and the virus was isolated from their brains, as well as from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys. Sequencing of the virus revealed that it was 100% identical in the nucleoprotein gene, but had a single non-synonymous substitution in the glycoprotein gene. The two vampire bat RABV isolates were found to be phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. Additionally, 7% of sera collected from 398 bats demonstrated RABV neutralizing antibody, indicating exposure to the virus. The proportion of seropositive bats varied significantly across trophic guilds, suggesting complex intraspecific compartmentalization of RABV perpetuation. This study is the first to report and isolate RABV from bats in Guatemala, and highlights the need for novel strategies to prevent and control bat-associated zoonoses in tropical regions.
Researchers investigated the role of A-type lamins in the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in cells. They found that A-type lamins play a crucial role in targeting the viral genome to the nuclear periphery, where it can replicate efficiently. In cells lacking A-type lamins, viral replication compartments were reduced in size and failed to target to the nuclear periphery. As a result, HSV DNA was associated with increased heterochromatin in these cells, leading to reduced viral gene expression and replication.

The study suggests that the nuclear lamina serves as a molecular scaffold for DNA genomes and the protein complexes that regulate both euchromatin and heterochromatin histone modifications. The researchers propose that the nuclear lamina provides a platform for the recruitment of viral DNA and chromatin-modifying enzymes that keep the viral genome in an active chromatin conformation.

The study also found that the requirement for lamin A by HSV replication was multiplicity-dependent, meaning that the reduction in replication in cells lacking A-type lamins was more pronounced at low multiplicities of infection. This suggests that A-type lamins play a critical role in the early stages of HSV infection.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of A-type lamins in HSV replication and highlights the importance of the nuclear lamina in regulating chromatin structure and viral gene expression. The findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of viral infection and the regulation of chromatin structure in cells.
Researchers have studied the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex in hydrogenosomes, a unique form of mitochondria found in the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis. The TOM complex is essential for importing proteins into mitochondria, but its structure and function have been poorly understood in many eukaryotic lineages. The study found that the TOM complex in T. vaginalis, called TvTOM, has a triplet-pore structure, which is different from the twin-pore structure found in some other eukaryotes. Electron microscopy revealed that TvTOM has a unique "skull-like" shape and is composed of four subunits, including two tail-anchored proteins that can bind to hydrogenosomal preproteins. The study also found that TvTOM is associated with the sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) 50, which is involved in β-barrel assembly. Phylogenetic profiling suggested that the triplet-pore TOM complex was present in the last common eukaryotic ancestor, while the receptors responsible for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukaryotic lineages. This study provides new insights into the diversity of TOM complexes in eukaryotes and sheds light on the evolution of protein import pathways in mitochondria. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of eukaryotic cells and the function of mitochondria in different organisms.
Researchers studied how genetic variations affect the behavior of two types of immune cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, which play a role in autoimmune diseases. They found that certain genetic variations can alter the expression of genes associated with autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, in these cells. One specific variation in the IL27 gene was found to decrease the activity of the protein and reduce the expression of downstream genes IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells. This variation is associated with type 1 diabetes and may contribute to the development of the disease. In contrast, another variation in the IL27 gene was found to promote autoimmunity towards pancreatic islets by upregulating the STAT1 pathway. Regulatory T cells, a type of CD4+ T cell, play a crucial role in controlling autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The study used a technique called eQTL mapping to identify genetic variations that affect gene expression in purified T cells. This approach revealed multiple effects on the regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases and highlighted the importance of considering the biological context in which genetic variations occur. The findings provide new insights into the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes, and may lead to a better understanding of the pathways involved in autoimmune diseases.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to understand community perspectives on the treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), also known as sleeping sickness. The study involved interviews and focus group discussions with current and former HAT patients, healthcare providers, and program managers in the provinces of Bandundu and Kasaï Oriental, where HAT prevalence is high. The researchers found that community members and healthcare providers enforce strict taboos after HAT treatment, including avoiding work, sexual intercourse, hot food, and walking in the sun for six months. These taboos are believed to prevent serious complications, but they are not evidence-based and were originally intended to mitigate the side effects of an outdated treatment regimen.

The study suggests that these taboos deter people from participating in HAT screening campaigns, as they fear having to follow these restrictions if diagnosed. The researchers argue that better understanding and addressing these community-enforced prohibitions is crucial to enhance the effectiveness of HAT control efforts. The study highlights the need for healthcare providers to engage in a dialogue with the community to keep abreast of the unintended transformations of meaning surrounding HAT treatment. The findings also emphasize the importance of providing correct health information and making safer and more effective treatment options available to improve HAT control strategies in the DRC.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive survey in 45 villages in eastern Gedaref State, Sudan, to estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The survey, conducted between May and June 2011, involved door-to-door interviews with 17,702 households, representing a population of 94,369 inhabitants. The study found that VL was a possible or probable cause of death in 19% of all deaths, resulting in a VL-specific mortality rate of 0.9/1000 per year. The overall incidence of VL over the past year was 7.0/1000 persons per year, or 7.9/1000 per year when deaths possibly or probably due to VL were included. The study also found that 12.5% of the population reported a past VL treatment episode.

The survey revealed that VL represents a significant health burden in eastern Gedaref State, with a crude mortality rate of 0.13/10,000 people per day over a mean recall period of 409 days. However, active VL case detection had a low yield in this setting, suggesting that it may not be the most effective intervention for controlling the disease in similar contexts. The study also highlighted the importance of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a skin rash that appears after VL treatment, which can last for months or years and is suspected to be an important parasite reservoir for human-to-human transmission.
Research has shown that gyrase, an enzyme responsible for DNA supercoiling, plays a crucial role in compacting bacterial chromosomes. The supercoil density (σ) of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms: diffusible supercoil density (σD) and constrained supercoil density (σC). In Escherichia coli, the two forms contribute equally to the total negative supercoil density. However, a study found that Escherichia coli chromosomes have a 15% higher level of σ compared to Salmonella enterica.

To investigate the mechanisms controlling diffusible supercoil density, researchers analyzed strains of Salmonella using a 9 kb "supercoil sensor" inserted at ten positions around the genome. The sensor monitored both supercoil density and transcription elongation rates in wild-type and mutant strains. The results showed that RNA transcription causes negative supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Topoisomerase I (Topo I) relaxed excess upstream supercoiling, while gyrase replenished downstream supercoil losses to maintain an equilibrium state.

Mutations in the gyrase gene (gyrB) caused significant supercoil losses in Salmonella, ranging from 30% of wild-type levels to a total loss of σD at most chromosome locations. These losses were influenced by transcription, as the addition of rifampicin (Rif) caused supercoil density to rebound throughout the chromosome. Gyrase mutants that caused dramatic supercoil losses also reduced transcription elongation rates throughout the genome. The study suggests that the catalytic efficiency of gyrase is linked to the elongation rate of transcription, and that bacteria with fast growth rates may generate higher supercoil densities than slow-growing species.
Researchers studied how the parasite Leishmania amazonensis grows inside host cells. They found that the parasite replicates in a membrane-bound compartment called a parasitophorous vacuole (PV), which shares characteristics with late endosomes and lysosomes. The size of the PV is crucial for the parasite's survival and growth, with larger PVs allowing the parasite to thrive. The researchers discovered that when host cells are infected with Leishmania amazonensis, they upregulate the expression of a protein called LYST/Beige, which regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYST/Beige led to larger PVs and enhanced parasite growth, while overexpression of LYST/Beige resulted in smaller PVs and inhibited parasite growth. Treatment with a compound called vacuolin-1 reversed the effect of LYST/Beige overexpression, expanding PVs and promoting parasite growth. In contrast, a compound called E-64d reduced PV size and inhibited parasite growth in cells with LYST/Beige mutations. The study suggests that the upregulation of LYST/Beige in infected cells is a host innate response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV volume and inhibiting intracellular survival. The researchers propose that targeting PV expansion could lead to new therapeutic strategies against Leishmania amazonensis infections, which cause cutaneous leishmaniasis in the New World.
Scientists have been trying to understand a rare genetic disorder called Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS), which causes severe intellectual disability, muscle weakness, and delayed development. The disorder is linked to a mutation in a gene called MCT8, which helps transport thyroid hormone (TH) into the brain. To study AHDS, researchers created a zebrafish model with the same MCT8 mutation. The zebrafish, called mct8−/−, showed similar symptoms to AHDS patients, including reduced locomotor activity, altered response to light and dark, and increased sleep time. High-speed imaging of the zebrafish brains revealed that the MCT8 mutation affected the formation of neural circuits and myelin, a fatty substance that protects nerve fibers. The researchers also found that the zebrafish had reduced filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. To test potential treatments, the researchers used three TH analogs that can enter the brain without the help of MCT8. These analogs restored the myelin and axon outgrowth deficiencies in the mct8−/− zebrafish. The study suggests that MCT8 plays a crucial role in regulating neural circuit assembly and that TH analogs may be a potential treatment for AHDS. The researchers propose that administering these analogs early in development could help reduce neurological damage in AHDS patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that can cause serious health problems in newborns and people with weakened immune systems. Researchers have been studying how HCMV infects cells to understand how it causes disease. A key part of this process is the interaction between two viral proteins, gH/gL and gB, which are essential for the virus to enter cells. These proteins work together to fuse the viral envelope with the cell membrane, allowing the virus to infect the cell.

Recent studies have shown that HCMV gB and gH/gL form a stable complex early in the virus's life cycle, even before other viral proteins are involved. This complex is found in the virus particles themselves, suggesting that it forms before the virus infects a cell. The researchers also found that gH/gL can interact with gB mutants that are unable to facilitate cell-cell fusion, indicating that the interaction between gH/gL and gB is not dependent on the virus's ability to fuse with cells.

This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of how HCMV and other herpesviruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), enter cells. Most models of herpesvirus entry suggest that gH/gL interacts with gB to trigger fusion, but this study provides the first direct evidence for this interaction in the context of a complete virus particle. The findings support the idea that gH/gL and gB work together to facilitate the entry of HCMV into cells.
Researchers have identified a new gene, Gimap3, that plays a crucial role in regulating the segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in certain tissues, specifically in leukocytes. Mitochondrial DNA sequence variants can lead to diseases, and understanding how they segregate is key to understanding disease onset and severity. The study used a heteroplasmic mouse model to demonstrate that Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial membrane GTPase, is a critical regulator of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues. Gimap3 is essential for T cell development and survival, suggesting that leukocyte survival may be a key factor in the genetic regulation of mtDNA sequence variants and in modulating human mitochondrial diseases.

The study found that Gimap3 regulates the rate of mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues, and that segregation of mtDNA haplotypes in these tissues is a complex genetic trait that is age-dependent but independent of mtDNA copy number. The researchers also showed that Gimap3 does not directly interact with mtDNA, and that a cell-specific context or pathway is required to alter mtDNA segregation. The study suggests that Gimap3 is the first nuclear-encoded gene to influence mtDNA segregation in mammals, and that it plays a critical role in regulating mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues.
Researchers in Victoria, Australia, studied the incubation period of Buruli ulcer (BU), a skin and soft-tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. The incubation period is the time between exposure to the bacteria and the onset of symptoms. The study found that the mean incubation period of BU in Victoria is approximately 4.5 to 4.8 months, with a range of 2 to 9 months. This estimate is consistent with a previous study of patients who acquired the infection in a different geographic location. The researchers analyzed data from 443 cases of BU notified in Victoria between 2013 and 2016, including 20 new cases identified in short-term visitors to endemic regions. The study found no association between the incubation period and factors such as age, sex, location of exposure, duration of exposure, or location of the BU lesion. The findings suggest that the mode of transmission of BU is similar in different geographic regions in Victoria. This knowledge can help guide clinicians in diagnosing and treating the disease. Buruli ulcer is a neglected tropical disease that is most prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, but cases have also been reported in other parts of the world, including Australia, where it is known as "Bairnsdale ulcer" or "Daintree ulcer." The primary risk factor for BU is residence or travel within an endemic area, but the precise mode of transmission remains incompletely understood.
Researchers have identified a protein in the parasite Toxoplasma gondii that plays a crucial role in regulating lipids within the cell. The protein, named TgNCR1, is similar to a human protein called NPC1, which is involved in cholesterol synthesis and transport. TgNCR1 contains a sterol-sensing domain, a region found in many proteins involved in lipid regulation. When expressed in human cells, TgNCR1 can restore normal cholesterol levels in cells lacking the human NPC1 protein. This suggests that TgNCR1 has a similar function to NPC1 in human cells.

To understand the role of TgNCR1 in Toxoplasma, the researchers created a strain of the parasite that lacks the TgNCR1 gene. This strain, called ΔNCR1, has normal cholesterol levels but accumulates other types of lipids, such as cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. The ΔNCR1 parasites also have abnormal storage lipid bodies and membranous tubules. Notably, these parasites can replicate more quickly and are more virulent in mice than the normal Toxoplasma strain.

These findings suggest that TgNCR1 is involved in maintaining lipid homeostasis in Toxoplasma, regulating the levels of various lipids within the cell. The researchers propose that the loss of TgNCR1 function leads to an overaccumulation of lipids, which in turn stimulates lipid storage, membrane biosynthesis, and parasite division. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of lipid regulation in Toxoplasma and highlights the importance of TgNCR1 in the parasite's life cycle.
Researchers have identified the genetic cause of ophthalmo-acromelic syndrome (OAS), also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by eye malformations and limb abnormalities. The study found that mutations in the SMOC1 gene, which codes for the protein SMOC-1, are responsible for the condition. SMOC-1 is a protein that regulates the activity of bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs), which play a crucial role in the development of the eyes, limbs, and other tissues. In people with OAS, the loss of SMOC-1 function disrupts the normal development of the eyes and limbs, leading to malformations such as anophthalmia (absence of one or both eyes) and post-axial oligosyndactyly (extra fingers or toes).

The researchers used a combination of genetic and animal studies to confirm the link between SMOC1 mutations and OAS. They found that mice with a targeted mutation in the Smoc1 gene, which is the mouse equivalent of SMOC1, developed similar eye and limb malformations to those seen in people with OAS. The study also showed that SMOC-1 has a conserved function in the development of the eyes and limbs across different species, including humans, mice, and zebrafish.

The findings provide new insights into the genetic causes of OAS and highlight the importance of SMOC-1 in the development of the eyes and limbs. The study suggests that the loss of SMOC-1 function disrupts the normal development of these tissues, leading to the characteristic malformations seen in OAS.
Researchers have identified a protein called TRIM22 as a key player in the body's natural defense against the HIV virus. When the body is exposed to Type 1 interferons, a type of protein that helps fight off viral infections, TRIM22 is produced in large quantities. This protein has been shown to inhibit the production of HIV particles by disrupting the virus's ability to assemble and release new copies of itself. Specifically, TRIM22 targets the Gag protein, a crucial component of the HIV virus, and prevents it from reaching the cell membrane where it would normally be released. Without TRIM22, HIV particles are able to escape the cell and infect other cells, leading to the progression of the disease. By studying the effects of TRIM22 on HIV replication, researchers have gained a better understanding of how the body's immune system responds to the virus and may lead to the development of new treatments or therapies to combat HIV. The study found that TRIM22's antiviral activity is dependent on its RING domain, a specific region of the protein that is essential for its function. This research provides new insights into the complex interactions between the body's immune system and the HIV virus, and highlights the potential of TRIM22 as a target for future antiviral therapies.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that contributes to the stability of the fig-pollinator mutualism, a symbiotic relationship between fig trees (Ficus) and their host-specific pollinator wasps (Agaonidae). In this mutualism, the wasps pollinate the trees and the trees provide resources for the wasp offspring. The researchers found that in the fig species Ficus rubiginosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to attack by parasitic wasps that oviposit from outside the syconium. This vulnerability decreases towards the center of the syconium, where inner ovules provide a safe space for pollinator offspring. The resulting gradient in offspring viability likely contributes to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, reducing their galling rates. This mechanism may contribute to mutualism persistence, independent of other factors such as plant defenses against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on pollinators. The study suggests that parasitic wasps may play a previously unidentified role in maintaining the stability of the fig-pollinator mutualism. The researchers propose that the provision of ovules with high variance in profitability to foundresses demonstrates that the fig tree, the larger partner in the symbiosis, controls the resources available to the smaller, more mobile partner, the wasp. This study provides new insights into the complex dynamics of the fig-pollinator mutualism and highlights the importance of considering the role of parasitic wasps in maintaining this symbiotic relationship.
Researchers studied how plant height is influenced by genetics and environment in a type of grass called Setaria. They grew plants in both controlled environments and in the field, and measured their height at different stages of development. The study found that plant height is a complex trait that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, such as water availability and planting density. Plants grown in water-limited conditions and at high densities were shorter than those grown in more favorable conditions.

The researchers used a technique called quantitative genetics to identify the genetic components that contribute to plant height. They found that plant height is a heritable trait, meaning it is influenced by genetics, and that multiple genes contribute to its development. The study also found that the contribution of these genes changes over time, with some genes influencing height early in development and others influencing it later.

The researchers identified 37 genetic loci associated with plant height in the Setaria population. They found that some of these loci are influenced by environmental factors, such as water availability, while others are not. The study suggests that plant height is a dynamic process that is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and that the contribution of these factors changes over time. This research has implications for understanding how plant traits are determined and how they can be improved through breeding and selection.
Researchers have confirmed the presence of the Ilheus virus (ILHV) in the Brazilian Pantanal, a vast wetland region in west-central Brazil. The virus was isolated from a pool of mosquitoes collected in the Nhecolândia sub-region of the Pantanal in 2009 and 2010. The mosquitoes, specifically the species Aedes scapularis, were found to be infected with ILHV, with a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1,000. This is the first time ILHV has been isolated from mosquitoes in the region.

Previous studies had detected neutralizing antibodies to various flaviviruses, including ILHV, in horses from the same area, but the virus had not been confirmed to be circulating in the region. The isolation of ILHV from mosquitoes suggests that the virus is actively being transmitted in the Pantanal. The Brazilian Pantanal is home to a diverse range of wildlife species and hematophagous arthropods, which creates an environment conducive to the spread of zoonotic arboviruses like ILHV.

The findings of this study are significant because they confirm the presence of a potentially medically important virus in the region. The virus was isolated while attempting to feed on a human, which warrants further investigation by the Brazilian arbovirus surveillance program and local physicians. The study highlights the importance of continued surveillance and monitoring of arboviruses in the Pantanal region to better understand the risk of transmission to humans and animals.
Researchers conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a new oral treatment for scabies, called moxidectin (MOX), compared to the current standard treatment, ivermectin (IVM). The study used a porcine scabies model, where 12 pigs were infected with scabies mites and then treated with either a single dose of MOX, two doses of IVM, or no treatment. The results showed that all four pigs treated with MOX were mite-free by day 14, while only two of the four pigs treated with IVM were mite-free. MOX was also more effective at reducing clinical scabies lesions, itching, and antibodies against the scabies mite. The study found that MOX persisted in the pigs' plasma and skin for about 9 times longer than IVM, allowing for long-lasting efficacy against the mites.

The study suggests that a single dose of MOX may be a more effective treatment for scabies than the current standard treatment of two doses of IVM. This is an important finding, as scabies is a significant public health burden worldwide, and there is a growing concern about the emergence of drug-resistant mites. The study's results support the potential of MOX as a new therapeutic approach for scabies, and further studies are planned to investigate its efficacy and safety in humans.
Researchers studied the peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis machine in Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics and commonly found in hospitals. The PG synthesis machine is responsible for creating the main component of the cell wall and is a target for many antibiotics. The researchers deleted seven of the nine genes that encode proteins involved in PG synthesis from the S. aureus genome, leaving only two proteins, PBP1 and PBP2, to perform this function. Surprisingly, the bacteria were still able to grow and divide normally. However, when exposed to antibiotics that target the cell wall, or to host lytic enzymes, the bacteria became highly susceptible. They also showed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model, which relies on specific peptidoglycan receptor proteins. This suggests that while the minimal PG synthesis machine is sufficient for growth in a lab setting, it is not sufficient for survival in more complex environments. The study identifies the minimal machinery required for PG synthesis in S. aureus and highlights the importance of redundant enzymes in the pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance of the bacteria. The findings have implications for the development of new antibiotics that target the final stages of PG synthesis.
Researchers studied the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes the disease melioidosis, to understand how it infects and survives within its hosts. They focused on how the bacterium acquires iron, a critical nutrient for bacterial growth. It was previously thought that B. pseudomallei used a common iron-acquisition system called siderophores to obtain iron. However, a previous study found that a clinical isolate of the bacterium could still be virulent despite lacking a major siderophore called malleobactin. To investigate further, the researchers deleted the genes responsible for malleobactin and another siderophore called pyochelin in a strain of B. pseudomallei. They found that the bacterium still had residual iron-acquisition activity, which was not due to other known siderophores or the production of chelators like citrate. The researchers also found that the bacterium could use hemin and hemoglobin as iron sources, and that a mutant unable to use hemin was still able to adapt and use these sources after prolonged incubation. Furthermore, they discovered that the bacterium could use ferritin, a protein that stores iron, as an iron source. In a mouse model of melioidosis, a mutant lacking malleobactin, pyochelin, hemin uptake, and ferritin utilization was still able to cause a lethal infection. These findings suggest that B. pseudomallei may use a novel ferritin-iron acquisition pathway to sustain its growth within its host.
Researchers have developed a new tool called COMMGEN to create more accurate and comprehensive models of cellular metabolism. These models, known as genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models (GSMs), are crucial for understanding how cells function. However, existing GSMs often contain inconsistencies that make them difficult to use. COMMGEN automatically identifies and resolves these inconsistencies by comparing multiple GSMs of the same organism. This process creates a consensus model that is more consolidated, comprehensive, and accurate than individual GSMs.

The tool works by classifying common problems that arise during GSM integration and using novel algorithms to resolve them. COMMGEN can also identify similar or identical reactions in different cellular compartments, which is a challenging task. The researchers tested COMMGEN on four organisms and found that the automatically generated consensus models were predictive and more coherent than individual GSMs. In fact, the consensus models had higher predictive power than manually curated GSMs and were comparable to manually constructed consensus models.

COMMGEN is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation is not feasible, such as for eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions. The tool increases the coherence of knowledge representation while maintaining predictive power, making it a valuable resource for understanding cellular function and interactions. Overall, COMMGEN provides a necessary bridge between full automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus metabolic model generation.
Researchers have discovered that the cartilage matrix plays a crucial role in regulating the timing of bone development in the body. They found that mutations in two genes, fam20b and xylt1, which are involved in the production of proteoglycans (PGs) in the cartilage matrix, lead to premature bone formation. PGs are complex molecules that provide structure and support to cartilage cells called chondrocytes. In normal development, chondrocytes mature and eventually induce bone formation in the surrounding tissue, called the perichondrium. However, in the absence of sufficient PGs, chondrocytes mature too quickly, leading to premature bone formation.

The researchers used zebrafish mutants to study the effects of fam20b and xylt1 mutations on cartilage development. They found that the mutants had decreased cartilage matrix and increased bone formation in the perichondrium. Further analysis revealed that the mutants failed to produce normal levels of chondroitin sulfate PGs, which are essential for cartilage structure and function. As a result, the chondrocytes in the mutants matured prematurely, leading to early bone formation.

The study suggests that the cartilage matrix plays a critical role in regulating the timing of bone development by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation. The findings have implications for our understanding of skeletal development and may provide insights into the causes of bone disorders associated with mutations in the fam20b and xylt1 genes.
Researchers investigated the role of Topoisomerase II (Top2) in the separation of heterochromatic regions during meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster females. They used RNA interference (RNAi) to knockdown Top2 expression in the later stages of meiosis and observed specific defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions. In Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, heterochromatic regions of both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes often failed to separate during prometaphase I and metaphase I. Instead, they were stretched into long, abnormal projections with centromeres localizing near the tips of the projections. Despite these anomalies, bipolar spindles were observed in most Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, but achiasmate chromosomes exhibited a near complete failure to move towards the spindle poles during prometaphase I. Both achiasmate and chiasmate chromosomes displayed defects in biorientation. Embryos from Top2 RNAi-expressing females frequently failed to initiate mitotic divisions. The study suggests that Topoisomerase II is involved in the resolution of heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis I and that these entanglements must be resolved for meiosis to be completed. The results indicate that Top2 plays a crucial role in releasing the bonds that hold heterochromatic regions together during prophase.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars to control and prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) in a highly endemic area in Brazil. The study involved two areas: an intervention area where dogs were collared and a control area where only conventional CVL control measures were applied. Dogs in both areas were tested for the disease every 7-8 months for almost two years. In the intervention area, dogs that remained seronegative received new collars and newly identified seronegative dogs were included and collared. Dogs that tested seropositive in both areas were marked for euthanasia as mandated by the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

The study found that the seroprevalence of CVL was similar in both areas at the beginning of the study. However, after two years, the seroprevalence in the intervention area decreased to 6.0%, while it increased to 11.0% in the control area. This suggests that the use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars provided protection against CVL in the intervention area. Although the study did not find a significant difference in CVL incidence between the two areas, there was an increased tendency in the control area, which may be due to low seroconversion rates or high loss to follow-up.

The study's findings indicate that the use of deltamethrin-impregnated collars as a community-wide public health control measure may provide protection against CVL over time. However, the study also highlights the operational challenges of implementing this strategy in endemic areas, suggesting the need for adjustments, including improved collar design.
Researchers investigated the unique characteristics of the mammalian X chromosome, specifically its non-random gene content. They proposed that the X chromosome's haploid expression, where one copy of the chromosome is present in males, limits the maximal expression level of genes on the X chromosome. This limitation, known as a "transcriptional traffic jam," prevents genes with very high maximal expression levels from being tolerated on the X chromosome. To test this hypothesis, the researchers analyzed data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM5) project. They found that the maximal expression of human X-linked genes is significantly lower than that of genes on autosomes, with an average of three times lower expression on the X chromosome. Additionally, autosome-to-X retroposition events resulted in lower maximal expression of retrogenes on the X chromosome compared to X-to-autosome retrogenes on autosomes. The researchers also found that X-linked genes have a lesser degree of increase in gene expression compared to autosomal genes, especially for highly expressed genes. These findings support the "weak X" model, which suggests that the upper limit for the highest attainable level of gene expression for X-linked genes is lower than for autosomal genes. The study's results provide a simple yet robust explanation for the peculiar features of X chromosome gene content, expression, and evolution.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, in the Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of the Western Pygmies in Cameroon. The researchers found that the Baka Pygmies had a significantly lower infection rate of H. pylori (20.8%) compared to their neighboring agriculturalist populations (80.2%). The study analyzed gastric biopsies from 77 Baka Pygmies and 101 non-Baka individuals and used DNA sequencing to generate multilocus haplotypes for each H. pylori isolate. The results showed that most isolates were assigned to the hpNEAfrica or hpAfrica1 populations, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified. An age-structured transmission model suggested that the low H. pylori prevalence among Baka Pygmies could be achieved within a few hundred years due to demographic factors such as small population size and low life expectancy. The study also used coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference to show that the Baka Pygmies likely acquired their current H. pylori through secondary contact with their agriculturalist neighbors. The findings suggest that the Baka Pygmies were either H. pylori-free or lost their ancient lineages during past demographic fluctuations. The study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of H. pylori and its relationship with human populations in Africa.
Researchers have identified a specific region of the dengue virus protein NS5 that plays a crucial role in determining its subcellular localization. The C-terminal 18 amino acid region (Cter18) of NS5 is responsible for directing the protein to either the cytoplasm or nucleus, depending on the dengue virus serotype. This region interacts with the nuclear import receptor importin-alpha, allowing the protein to be transported into the nucleus. A conserved arginine residue, R888, is essential for the virus's ability to replicate and produce infectious particles. Mutating this residue to alanine resulted in a completely non-viable virus, while a mutation to lysine led to a severely attenuated phenotype. In contrast, a mutation to threonine at position 884 resulted in the protein being mostly localized to the cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. The Cter18 region is highly conserved across different dengue virus serotypes and may play a role in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of its role in subcellular localization. The findings suggest that the Cter18 region is a key determinant of NS5's subcellular localization and distribution, and that small changes in this region can have significant effects on the virus's phenotype.
Researchers have developed a new, integrated mapping protocol to help control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). These diseases, such as lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths, are prevalent in many countries but often lack the necessary data for effective public health programs. The new protocol, called Integrated Threshold Mapping (ITM), aims to determine whether a threshold for public health interventions has been reached in a given area. ITM is designed to be resource-efficient and relies on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators for each disease. The protocol was field-tested in one district each in Mali and Senegal, comparing it to current WHO mapping methodologies for each disease. The results showed that ITM reached the same conclusions as the WHO methodologies for trachoma, lymphatic filariasis, and soil-transmitted helminths, but provided more targeted intervention recommendations for schistosomiasis. ITM was found to be practical, feasible, and cost-saving compared to the standard WHO methodologies. This integrated mapping tool has the potential to facilitate the implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries. The ITM methodology does not provide prevalence figures, but rather determines whether a disease has reached the threshold for public health intervention, striking a balance between epidemiologic rigor and field practicality.
Researchers studied how a protein called Cdc14 is released from a specific part of the cell's DNA, called nucleolar chromatin, during a process called mitosis. Cdc14 is important for the cell to exit mitosis and move on to the next stage of its life cycle. Two pathways, called FEAR and MEN, work together to release Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin. However, the exact mechanisms behind this process were not well understood.

The researchers found that a specific type of modification to a protein called histone H2B, called ubiquitination, is necessary for Cdc14 to be released from nucleolar chromatin. This modification is carried out by an enzyme called Bre1. The researchers also found that another type of modification to histone H3, called methylation, is required for Cdc14 release. Specifically, methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (meH3K4 and meH3K79) and methylation on lysine 36 (meH3K36) are necessary for Cdc14 release.

The researchers also found that a protein called Sir2, which is involved in removing acetyl groups from histones, is not necessary for Cdc14 release. This is surprising, as Sir2 is associated with Cdc14 on nucleolar chromatin. The researchers suggest that the histone modifications may make it easier for the FEAR network components to access and act on nucleolar chromatin, allowing Cdc14 to be released. These findings provide new insights into the complex process of mitotic exit and highlight the importance of histone modifications in regulating this process.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework called GeneProgram to identify and analyze gene expression programs in human cells. These programs are sets of co-expressed genes that work together to orchestrate normal or pathological processes. GeneProgram addresses several challenges in identifying these programs, including cellular inhomogeneity, genetic and environmental variation, and uncertainty in the number of programs and sample populations. The framework uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior. GeneProgram produces maps of expression programs, which are sorted by generality scores that reflect the functional breadth of each program. Using synthetic and real gene expression data, the researchers showed that GeneProgram outperformed several popular expression analysis methods. They applied GeneProgram to a compendium of 62 short time-series gene expression datasets, exploring the responses of human cells to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. The analysis revealed a map of 104 expression programs, many of which were significantly enriched for genes involved in key signaling pathways and/or bound by NF-κB transcription factors. GeneProgram also discovered expression programs that implicated surprising signaling pathways or receptor types in the response to infection, including Wnt signaling and neurotransmitter receptors. The researchers believe that the discovered map of expression programs will be useful for guiding future biological experiments, and that genes from programs with low generality scores may serve as new drug targets.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the interferon-gamma (IFNG) locus in NKG2Chi natural killer (NK) cells. NKG2Chi NK cells are a subset of NK cells that are expanded in individuals infected with HCMV. These cells play a crucial role in the defense against HCMV and are characterized by the stable expression of IFN-γ, a cytokine that helps to fight off viral infections.

Research has shown that memory-like features can be observed in NK cell subsets after HCMV infection. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying NK cell adaptive properties have not been fully understood. This study found that only NKG2Chi NK cells expanded in HCMV-seropositive individuals underwent epigenetic remodeling of the IFNG conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1), similar to memory CD8+ T cells and TH1 cells.

The epigenetic remodeling of the CNS1 region in the IFNG locus enhanced IFN-γ transcriptional activity in response to NKG2C and 2B4 engagement, leading to consistent IFN-γ production in NKG2Chi NK cells. This study identifies epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus as a hallmark and crucial mechanism driving strong and stable IFN-γ expression in HCMV-specific NK cell expansions. The findings provide a molecular basis for the regulation of adaptive features in innate cells and suggest that common epigenomic features may be functional hallmarks of memory-like NK cells and memory T cells.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Legionella pneumophila regulates its infection of host cells. The bacterium uses a protein called LubX to target and degrade another protein, SidH, which is also produced by the bacterium. This process involves hijacking the host cell's proteasome, a complex that breaks down and recycles proteins. The timing of this regulation is crucial, as it allows the bacterium to control the activity of SidH at different stages of infection. This is an example of a "metaeffector," a protein that regulates the function of another effector protein within the host cell. The discovery of LubX as a metaeffector highlights a sophisticated level of coevolution between the bacterium and its host cells. The study also suggests that other bacterial effectors may have similar regulatory functions, which could be important for coordinating the expression of effector functions at different stages of infection. The findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between bacteria and their host cells, and could have implications for the development of new treatments for bacterial infections. The discovery of LubX as a metaeffector also raises questions about the role of other bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligases, which may have multiple targets within host cells, including both bacterial and host proteins.
Researchers studied the early stages of HIV-1 infection in 81 individuals to understand how the virus evolves and adapts to its new host. They analyzed the genetic sequences of the virus's env gene, which plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to infect cells and evade the immune system. The study found that some parts of the env gene diversified more rapidly than expected, suggesting that the virus is adapting to its new host. This rapid diversification was linked to two main factors: cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape and APOBEC-mediated hypermutation. CTL escape occurs when the virus mutates to evade the immune system's T-cells, while APOBEC is an enzyme that introduces mutations into the virus's genome. The study found that some rapidly diversifying sites were embedded in CTL epitopes, suggesting that APOBEC may facilitate early immune escape. Additionally, the researchers found that insertions and deletions in the virus's genome were not random, but rather were influenced by selection pressures. The study's findings provide new insights into the early stages of HIV-1 infection and the mechanisms by which the virus adapts to its new host. The results highlight the importance of CTL escape and APOBEC-mediated hypermutation in shaping the virus's evolution during the establishment of new infections. Overall, the study provides a detailed view of the process of HIV-1 diversification following transmission, shedding light on the complex interactions between the virus and its host.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the process of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast. Epigenetic silencing is a mechanism that regulates gene expression by modifying chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes. The model focuses on two key chromatin marks, H4K16 acetylation and H3K79 methylation, and explores how the presence of multiple marks affects the stability of epigenetic states. The study finds that having both modifications is crucial for the robustness of epigenetic silencing. The model also predicts the emergence of a novel state with both active and silencing marks, known as bivalent chromatin, under certain conditions. This bivalent state is shown to result in patchy silencing, where some regions of the chromatin are silenced while others remain active. The study also investigates the behavior of silencing proteins, such as Sir and Dot1, and how they interact with chromatin. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, allowing researchers to identify which marks are essential for resolving epigenetic fate and which simply reinforce one fate over another. The study provides new insights into the design principles of the silencing system and sheds light on the controversial role of Dot1 in yeast silencing.
Researchers in Uganda studied the gut microbiota (GM) of children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). SAM is a major health problem in developing countries, manifesting in two forms: oedematous and non-oedematous. The study aimed to determine if GM composition differed between the two types of malnutrition. The researchers collected fecal samples from 87 children aged 6-24 months and analyzed them using a technique called 16S rRNA gene-targeted high-throughput amplicon sequencing. They found that the GM composition differed between the two groups, with non-oedematous children having lower GM diversity. However, the study did not identify clear compositional differences between the GM of children with oedematous and non-oedematous SAM. The study suggests that non-oedematous SAM children have lower GM diversity compared to oedematous SAM children. This finding could justify further research into therapeutic strategies, such as pre- and probiotics, to address SAM in developing countries. Malnutrition remains a major problem in developing countries, with SAM accounting for 12.6% of total deaths of children younger than 5 years of age. The factors determining the clinical phenotype of SAM, including oedematous and non-oedematous forms, remain unresolved.
Researchers studied the variation in telomere length among 112 wild yeast isolates and found significant differences in telomere length between two geographic subpopulations of Saccharomyces paradoxus. European strains had extremely short telomeres, while American isolates had telomeres that were approximately three times as long. The researchers used a genetic technique to analyze individual telomere lengths and found that the variation in telomere length was controlled by multiple genetic loci. They identified several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with telomere length and silencing variation, including the YKU80 and TLC1 genes, which were found to be telomere-length QTLs in the two S. paradoxus subpopulations. The researchers also discovered that sequence divergence within the Ku heterodimer generated negative epistasis in one of the allelic combinations, resulting in very short telomeres. The study suggests that telomere length is a complex trait controlled by multiple genetic loci, and that the variation in telomere length is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying telomere length regulation in yeast and have implications for our understanding of telomere biology in other organisms, including humans.
Researchers investigated how people make decisions when given the option to choose at any time, rather than being forced to respond immediately. They used computational models and brain imaging techniques, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to study decision-making in a task where participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues. Standard models of decision-making, known as sequential sampling models (SSMs), did not accurately predict response times (RTs) in this scenario. The researchers developed an extended version of the SSM that included a mechanism for postponing decisions, which provided a better fit to the data. Time-frequency analysis of EEG data revealed alternating states of increased and decreased oscillatory power in beta-band frequencies, indicating that participants were repeatedly preparing and inhibiting responses, suggesting a "decision not to decide." The extended model also accounted for the results of an adapted version of the paradigm where participants had to press a button to request more information. The findings suggest that people may actively terminate the decision process to wait for more information, and that this behavior is reflected in specific brain activity patterns. The researchers propose that factors such as the number of cues and their presentation time influence how long people delay their decision-making process.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in Labrador Retrievers with hereditary nasal parakeratosis (HNPK), a skin disorder that causes crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. The mutation is a missense variant in the SUV39H2 gene, which codes for a histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methyltransferase. This enzyme plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation, specifically in the silencing of chromatin. The mutation changes an asparagine to a lysine in the catalytically active domain of the enzyme, potentially disrupting its function.

The study used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the mutation, which was then confirmed in a larger cohort of dogs. Histopathological analysis revealed that the HNPK phenotype is not caused by hyperproliferation, but rather delayed terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. This suggests that SUV39H2 is involved in the epigenetic regulation of keratinocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and tight sealing of the mammalian epidermis.

The researchers speculate that the tissue-specific expression profiles of the partially redundant H3K9 methyltransferases may explain why a defect in a broadly expressed enzyme leads to a very tissue-specific clinical phenotype. The study provides new insights into the epigenetics of keratinocyte differentiation and highlights the importance of SUV39H2 in maintaining the integrity of the epidermis.
Researchers studied how two types of influenza A viruses (IAVs), one from birds and one from pigs, interact when they infect pigs together. They found that when these two viruses infect the same pig, they can swap genetic material and create new, potentially transmissible viruses. This process, called genetic reassortment, can lead to the emergence of new pandemic strains. The study focused on pigs because they are thought to be a "mixing vessel" where avian and mammalian IAVs can combine to create new viruses that could spread to humans.

The researchers analyzed 571 samples from pigs infected with both viruses and found 30 distinct genotypes of reassortant viruses. They discovered that these viruses were more diverse in the lower respiratory tract than in other parts of the pig's body. The study also found that the viruses that were shed from the pigs were more likely to be those that could grow well in the pig's nasal cells at a temperature of 33°C.

The results suggest that the lower respiratory tract is a key location for genetic reassortment between avian and swine IAVs, and that tissue tropism, or the ability of a virus to infect specific tissues, plays a crucial role in determining which reassortant viruses are shed from the pig. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how new pandemic strains of influenza may emerge and how they may be transmitted between animals and humans.
Researchers investigated the impact of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on the risk of S. mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five years. The study, conducted in Uganda, involved 1343 children whose mothers were either treated with praziquantel or a placebo during pregnancy. The results showed that 32 children (2.4%) had S. mansoni infection at age five years, with no significant difference in infection prevalence between children of treated or untreated mothers. The study also found that infected children had higher cytokine and antibody responses to S. mansoni antigens compared to uninfected children. However, praziquantel treatment during pregnancy had no significant effect on immune responses, except for IL-10 responses to SWA, which were higher in offspring of women who received praziquantel during pregnancy. The study suggests that maternal S. mansoni infection and its treatment during pregnancy may not influence the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni infection or effector immune response among offspring at age five years. However, the observed effects on IL-10 responses to SWA suggest that maternal S. mansoni and its treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schistosomiasis. This may have implications for the pathogenesis of the disease.
Macrophages, a type of immune cell, play a crucial role in fighting off infections by engulfing and eliminating pathogens. However, the process of how macrophages are activated to efficiently clear pathogens is not well understood. Researchers have discovered that inflammatory stimuli can reprogram the macrophage's endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macropinocytosis, a process that allows for the rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes. This reprogramming is triggered by the phosphorylation of the macrophage protein coronin 1, which activates phosphoinositol-3-kinase activity necessary for macropinocytic uptake.

Studies have shown that when macrophages are activated, serine phosphorylation of coronin 1 is the key molecular switch that reprograms the macrophage from a phagocytic uptake mode to macropinocytosis. The researchers found that expressing a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 was sufficient to induce PI3-kinase activation and macropinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. This suggests that coronin 1 phosphorylation is the crucial switch from a phagocytic to a macropinocytic uptake mode upon macrophage activation.

The study also found that constitutive macropinocytosis is unaltered regardless of the activation state of the macrophages and proceeds even in the absence of coronin 1. Induction of macropinocytosis through cytokine-mediated macrophage activation is an efficient strategy for the immune system to clear large amounts of extracellular material and eradicate pathogenic material.
Researchers conducted a study in Arua District, North West Uganda, to assess community acceptance of tsetse control baits, which are used to combat sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis or HAT). The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages across the district. The results showed that community members who had never seen the baits before expressed fear, anxiety, and panic due to associations with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river," which are traditionally linked with physical or mental illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers living in areas where traps had been used previously had positive attitudes towards them and were fully aware of their purpose and benefits. The study suggests that acceptance of traps varies markedly between villages and is related to the duration of experience with tsetse control programs. The success of community-based interventions against tsetse will depend on early engagement with communities and carefully designed sensitization campaigns that reach all communities, especially those living in areas new to such interventions. The study highlights the importance of community acceptance of traps for effective tsetse control, citing examples from other regions where negative attitudes towards traps led to operational failure.
Scientists have long understood the importance of recombination, a biological process that shuffles genetic material during reproduction, in shaping the evolution of species. However, detailed studies of recombination rates across genomes and within species have been limited, making it difficult to assess the impact of recombination on the evolutionary process. A new study in Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, provides the first high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination rates. The researchers mapped over 106,000 recombination events across the Drosophila genome, distinguishing between two types of recombination: crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC). They found that CO rates vary greatly across the genome, with hotspots of high recombination rates and coldspots of low recombination rates. In contrast, GC rates are more evenly distributed across the genome. The study also found that recombination events are associated with specific DNA sequences and tend to occur within gene regions, suggesting that the accessibility of chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins, influences recombination. These findings highlight the complexity of recombination and emphasize the need to consider multiple layers of variation in recombination rates when studying the interaction between selection and linkage in populations. The study's high-resolution maps of recombination rates in Drosophila provide a valuable resource for understanding the evolution of this species and have implications for the study of recombination in other organisms.
Researchers have identified a protein called IDN2 and its paralogs, IDP1 and IDP2, as essential components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana. IDN2 forms a complex with IDP1 and IDP2, which is required for the RdDM pathway. The study found that the coiled-coil domain of IDN2 is necessary for its homodimerization, but not for its interaction with IDP1 and IDP2. In contrast, the XH domain of IDN2 is required for its interaction with IDP1 and IDP2, and is essential for the functioning of the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex in RdDM. IDP1 is necessary for de novo DNA methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional gene silencing, while IDP2 has partially overlapping roles with IDP1. Unlike IDN2, IDP1 and IDP2 are unable to bind double-stranded RNA, suggesting that their roles in the IDN2-IDP1/IDP2 complex are distinct from those of IDN2. The study also found that the XH domain of IDN2 is essential for its function in RdDM and transcriptional gene silencing in vivo. Mutations in the XH domain of IDN2 resulted in a failure to complement the DNA methylation defect of the idn2 mutant at a canonical RdDM target.
Researchers studied how neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, respond to Leishmania braziliensis, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and play a crucial role in fighting infections. The study found that when neutrophils are exposed to Leishmania braziliensis, they become activated and release inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and neutrophil elastase. This activation is accompanied by an increase in the production of superoxide, a hallmark of neutrophil activation. The study also found that neutrophils infected with Leishmania braziliensis display markers of early apoptosis, or programmed cell death.

The researchers used various methods to study the interaction between neutrophils and Leishmania braziliensis, including in vivo and in vitro experiments. In vivo, they found that neutrophils accumulate at the site of Leishmania braziliensis inoculation, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro, they found that neutrophils exposed to Leishmania braziliensis modulate the expression of surface molecules, such as CD18 and CD62L, and induce the oxidative burst. The study suggests that Leishmania braziliensis induces neutrophil recruitment in vivo and that neutrophils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact parasite elimination, particularly at the early stages of infection.
Researchers explored the potential benefits of using cattle vaccination as a supplementary control measure for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain. Currently, vaccination is not used in international control programs, and it is illegal in the European Union due to interference with the tuberculin skin test, which is used to determine if animals, herds, and countries are bTB-free. However, new diagnostic tests that can differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) offer a potential solution. The researchers used within-herd transmission models to estimate the feasibility of using BCG vaccination in combination with DIVA testing. They found that the specificity of the DIVA test, rather than its sensitivity, is the greatest barrier to seeing a herd-level benefit of vaccination. To achieve a protective herd-level benefit, the DIVA test would need to have a specificity of at least 99.85% and a sensitivity of over 40%. The researchers estimated that a cocktail of three DIVA antigens could achieve this target specificity while maintaining a sensitivity of 73.3%. They also explored scenarios for the use of BCG vaccination in combination with DIVA testing and considered the potential economic benefits relative to the current regime of tuberculin testing.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds, called dihydrobenzoxazepinones, that show promise as a treatment for trichuriasis, a parasitic infection caused by the whipworm Trichuris trichiura. This infection affects around 500 million people worldwide, causing physical and educational problems. Current treatments are limited and often ineffective, making new options crucial. The researchers used a model parasite, Trichuris muris, to screen a library of 480 small molecules and found that dihydrobenzoxazepinones were effective in paralyzing the adult parasite. Further testing identified 20 active compounds, which showed low toxicity to mouse gut cells, indicating selectivity for the parasite. One of these compounds, OX02983, also reduced the ability of infected eggs to establish infection in mice. This suggests that dihydrobenzoxazepinones could be used not only to treat existing infections but also to prevent new ones by targeting the parasite's lifecycle. The discovery of this new class of anthelmintics is an important step towards developing a more effective treatment for trichuriasis.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks. Date hubs are thought to have low co-expression with their partners, while party hubs have high co-expression. However, the study found that the importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of highly central hubs that do not display low expression correlation. This challenges the idea that date hubs are global connectors and party hubs are local coordinators. The study also found that the bimodal distribution of hub co-expression, which motivated the date/party distinction, is not robust to methodological changes. Additionally, topological properties of hubs do not generally correlate with co-expression. Instead, the study found significant correlations between interaction centrality and the functional similarity of interacting proteins. The researchers suggest that thinking in terms of a date/party dichotomy for hubs in protein interaction networks is not meaningful and that it might be more useful to consider roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins. The study's findings suggest that the roles of hubs in protein interaction networks are more diverse than previously thought and cannot be explained by a simple dichotomy.
Researchers have developed methods to reconstruct transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks using whole genome sequence data. However, a major limitation of these approaches is the need for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. This means that the position of infected individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved by genetic data if mutations have accumulated between sampled pathogen genomes. To quantify and compare the useful genetic diversity expected from genetic data in different pathogen outbreaks, the concept of 'transmission divergence' was introduced. Transmission divergence is defined as the number of mutations separating whole genome sequences sampled from transmission pairs. Using simulated outbreak scenarios and sequence evolution models, researchers estimated transmission divergence for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens. The results showed that transmission divergence is generally very low, with many outbreaks characterized by large numbers of genetically identical transmission pairs. This limited genetic diversity had a significant impact on the ability to reconstruct outbreaks, highlighting the need to expand the toolkit of outbreak reconstruction tools to integrate other types of epidemiological data. The study found that genetic sequence data of rapidly evolving pathogens, such as RNA viruses, can provide valuable information on individual transmission events, while sequence data of pathogens with lower mean transmission divergence, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella sonnei, and Clostridium difficile, provide little to no information about individual transmission events.
Researchers studied how genes on the X chromosome are silenced in female mammals, a process called X chromosome inactivation (XCI). They found that while most genes on the inactive X chromosome (Xi) are silenced, some genes escape this silencing and continue to be expressed. The team analyzed gene expression and chromatin structure in mouse tissues and cells to identify these escape genes. They discovered that only a small percentage of genes (3-7%) escape XCI in mouse tissues, but a higher percentage (21%) escape in an in vitro cell line called Patski. This suggests that XCI and escape from XCI are tightly controlled in the body, but can be influenced by the type of cell or tissue. The researchers also found that genes that escape XCI are often involved in regulating transcription and translation, and are highly sensitive to dosage. They identified tissue-specific escape genes, which could help explain sex differences in certain tissues. The team used a new algorithm to analyze gene expression and found that the probability of bi-allelic (expressed from both X chromosomes) versus mono-allelic (expressed from only one X chromosome) expression can be calculated for any gene in the genome. This study provides new insights into the regulation of XCI and escape from XCI, and could have implications for understanding sex differences in gene expression and disease.
Researchers have identified a new cysteine protease in the malaria parasite Plasmodium vivax, called vivapain-4 (VX-4). This protease has unique properties that allow it to switch between different substrates depending on the pH of its environment. At acidic pH, VX-4 is most active against hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells. At neutral pH, it is most active against a protein called plasmepsin 4, which is important for the parasite's survival. VX-4 also has the ability to break down actin, a protein that makes up the cytoskeleton of red blood cells.

VX-4 is found in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the parasite, where it plays a crucial role in the parasite's life cycle. The researchers used a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques to study the properties of VX-4 and understand its role in the parasite's biology. They found that VX-4 has a unique set of amino acids that allow it to recognize and bind to different substrates at different pH levels.

The discovery of VX-4 provides new insights into the biology of Plasmodium vivax and may lead to the development of new treatments for malaria. Cysteine proteases like VX-4 are potential targets for antimalarial drugs, and understanding their properties and functions is essential for the development of effective treatments. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of VX-4 in the parasite's life cycle and to identify potential inhibitors that can block its activity.
Researchers have developed a new genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) for the bacterium Clostridium ljungdahlii. This model, called iJL965-ME, is the first of its kind for a Gram-positive bacterium and includes all major metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as pathways for RNA and protein synthesis. The model allows researchers to predict how protein allocation and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation in acetogens, which are microorganisms that can ferment a wide range of substrates.

The ME-model accurately predicted the secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol, during changing carbon and metal availability. It also revealed how protein allocation and media composition affect metabolic pathways and energy conservation in C. ljungdahlii. The model's predictions were experimentally validated, providing new knowledge about the proteome utilization and carbon flux in acetogens.

The ME-model can be used to design new strategies for the biotechnological production of commodity chemicals. For example, it predicted the formation of glycerol, a novel product for C. ljungdahlii, which broadens the metabolic capability of this model microbe. Additionally, the model's predictions of changing secretion rates based on different metal availability can be used to optimize fermentation processes. Overall, the iJL965-ME model provides new insights into the biology of C. ljungdahlii and can be used to improve the design of acetogens for biotechnological applications.
Researchers used a panel of human osteoblasts (HObs) to study how genetic variations affect the expression of different transcript isoforms, which are different versions of the same gene. They compared their findings to those from a similar study using lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). The study found that genetic variations in HObs are associated with the expression of specific transcript isoforms, and that these associations are tissue-specific and tissue-independent. This means that some genetic variations affect the expression of certain isoforms in HObs, but not in LCLs, while others affect the expression of the same isoforms in both cell types.

The researchers also found that multiple transcript isoforms are often present in both HObs and LCLs, and that genetic control can affect the relative expression of one isoform to another, rather than having an all-or-none effect. They identified a novel transcript isoform variant in the FAM118A gene, which was associated with bone mineral density in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The study suggests that examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types can help detect genetic variations that are common to different cell types and identify cell-specific isoform variants that may be functionally relevant.

The researchers validated their findings using RT-PCR and found that a large proportion of variation for genes expressed in both HObs and LCLs is common between them. They also identified specific pathways, such as the Wnt/β-catenin signaling system and IGF-1 signaling pathways, that are preferentially under the influence of genetic control in HObs.
Researchers studied the yeast Saccharomyces eubayanus, a parent of the lager-brewing hybrid Saccharomyces pastorianus. They found that S. eubayanus can't use maltotriose, a common sugar in beer wort, because it lacks a maltotriose transporter gene. However, the yeast can use maltose, a similar sugar. The researchers created a new maltotriose transporter gene in S. eubayanus by combining parts of its maltose transporter genes. This new gene, called SeMALT413, allowed the yeast to use maltotriose. The researchers think that this new gene evolved through a process called neofunctionalization, where a gene changes its function over time. They also found that the structure of SeMALT413 is similar to the maltotriose transporter gene in S. pastorianus, a yeast used in beer brewing. This suggests that the evolution of maltotriose transporters in S. pastorianus may have involved similar mechanisms. The study shows that yeast can adapt to use new sugars through genetic changes, which could be useful for improving beer brewing and other biotechnological applications.
Researchers have identified a correlation between the severity of influenza outbreaks and the degree of antigenic variation in the virus. Antigenic variation refers to changes in the virus's surface proteins, which can affect its ability to infect humans. By analyzing data from past influenza outbreaks, the study found a positive correlation between the extent of antigenic variation and the number of excess deaths caused by the virus. This relationship was observed across different types of seasonal influenza viruses, including H1N1, H3N2, and B viruses.

Using this correlation, the researchers developed a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by predicting the antigenic distance between different strains of the virus. Antigenic distance is a measure of how different two strains are in terms of their surface proteins. The method, called EADpred, uses machine learning algorithms to analyze the genetic sequences of the virus and predict the antigenic distance between different strains.

The study found that EADpred was able to accurately predict antigenic distance with a high degree of accuracy, suggesting its potential utility in rapid estimation of influenza mortality burden. The researchers believe that this method can be used to quickly assess the mortality burden of new seasonal strains of the virus, helping to inform public health responses and control measures. This could lead to more effective and cost-effective strategies for preventing and controlling influenza outbreaks.
Researchers have identified a small protein from the Asian soybean rust fungus, Phakopsora pachyrhizi, that helps the fungus evade the soybean plant's immune system. The protein, called PpEC23, is a type of cysteine-rich protein that is secreted by the fungus and interacts with a soybean transcription factor called GmSPL12l. This interaction suppresses the plant's immune response, making it easier for the fungus to infect the plant.

The study found that GmSPL12l acts as a negative regulator of soybean defenses, meaning that it helps to keep the plant's immune system from becoming too active. When GmSPL12l is silenced, the plant's immune response becomes constitutively active, meaning it is always "on" and ready to defend against infection. This suggests that GmSPL12l plays a key role in regulating the plant's immune response.

The researchers also found that PpEC23 is a representative of a conserved protein-protein interaction platform used by rust fungi to manipulate host immune responses. This means that other rust fungi may use similar proteins to evade the immune systems of their host plants. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which rust fungi interact with their host plants and could lead to the development of new strategies for controlling soybean rust disease.
Researchers have identified the EphrinA2 receptor (EphA2) as a key player in the invasion and replication of the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. This bacterium infects host cells and replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. The researchers found that EphA2 is a receptor on the surface of host cells that Chlamydia binds to, allowing it to enter the cell. Once inside, the bacterium activates the EphA2 receptor, which in turn activates a signaling pathway called PI3 kinase (PI3K). This pathway is essential for the bacterium's replication.

The study showed that interfering with the binding of Chlamydia to EphA2, reducing EphA2 expression, or inhibiting its activity significantly reduced the infection. The researchers also found that Chlamydia interacts with and activates EphA2 on the cell surface, leading to the internalization of both the bacterium and the receptor. During replication, EphA2 remains active and accumulates around the inclusion, interacting with the PI3K pathway to support the bacterium's growth.

The study suggests that EphA2 is not only a receptor for Chlamydia entry but also plays a role in intracellular signaling, facilitating the bacterium's replication. The researchers also found that overexpressing EphA2 enhanced PI3K activation and Chlamydia infection, while depleting EphA2 from the cell surface led to the upregulation of the receptor, keeping the infected cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which Chlamydia infects and replicates within host cells.
Researchers have long known that neurons have active ion channels in their dendrites, which can support non-linear summation and dendritic spikes. However, the role of these active dendritic conductances has remained unclear. A new study suggests that the primary function of active dendritic conductances is to enhance the dynamic range of neurons. Dynamic range refers to the ability of a neuron to detect and respond to a wide range of signal strengths without becoming saturated. The study used a model of an active dendritic tree and found that it can achieve extremely large dynamic ranges, exceeding 50 decibels. The model also predicts that neurons with larger dendritic trees should have larger dynamic ranges and that blocking active conductances should lead to a decrease in dynamic range. This is because active dendrites can detect and amplify weak signals while saturating slowly for stronger signals. The study's results also suggest that dendritic spikes can lead to a double-sigmoid response function, as observed in retinal ganglion cells. This means that the neuron's transfer function is not simply a Hill-like saturating curve, but rather a more complex curve with two distinct regions of response. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of active dendritic conductances and their importance for neuronal function.
Researchers have developed methods to infer regulatory interactions and quantitative models of gene regulation from time-series transcriptomics data. However, these methods often rely on assumptions that may not be valid, such as treating mRNA abundance as representative of protein concentrations and neglecting global physiological effects. To address this, the authors investigated the importance of these assumptions using a combination of models and experiments. They measured the activity of genes involved in the FliA-FlgM module of the E. coli motility network in real-time and in vivo, and estimated protein concentrations and global physiological effects using kinetic models of gene expression. The results show that correcting for the bias of these assumptions improves the quality of the models inferred from the data. The authors propose new controls for transcriptome experiments, including the use of constitutively-expressed genes, and mathematical models and computational procedures for reconstructing protein concentrations and integrating global physiological effects into the network inference process. They demonstrate the importance of global physiological effects and the active regulation of FliA and FlgM half-lives for the dynamics of FliA-dependent promoters. The approach is broadly applicable to systems where protein concentrations have longer half-lives and the activity of the gene expression machinery varies more strongly across conditions.
Researchers studied the distribution and behavior of Oligoryzomys fulvescens, a rodent species that carries a virus that can be transmitted to humans, in the Agua Buena region of Panama. They analyzed data collected over four years, from 2006 to 2009, to understand how the rodent population changed over time and space. The study found that the population density and distribution of O. fulvescens varied significantly across seasons and years. The rodents were typically absent during the late transitional months of the season, but re-established themselves in the same area the following year. However, in the final year of the study, the population re-established itself further south. Spatial analysis revealed that local populations of O. fulvescens were approximately 300-600 meters in size, with sharply demarcated borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats. The study also found that human activities, such as agriculture, influenced the rodent population's distribution and abundance. The results suggest that the risk of disease transmission from O. fulvescens to humans varies over time and space, making it challenging to predict and monitor zoonotic disease outbreaks. The study highlights the importance of understanding the complex dynamics of rodent populations and their relationship with the environment to better manage disease risk.
Researchers have developed a new method to understand how genetic changes in the influenza A (H3N2) virus affect its ability to evade the human immune system. This is crucial for creating effective vaccines. The method, called "antigenic trees," assigns weights to genetic changes in the virus's surface protein, hemagglutinin, to determine their impact on the virus's ability to evade immunity. The researchers applied this method to 35 years of data on the H3N2 virus and found that it accurately predicted the impact of genetic changes on the virus's antigenic properties. The method also identified both known and new sites on the virus where genetic changes have a significant impact on its ability to evade the immune system. This information can be used to identify which genetic changes are most important for vaccine development. The method can also be applied to other viruses and systems where genetic sequences and associated phenotype distances are available. The researchers found that their method was comparable in accuracy to a previous method called antigenic cartography, but provided more detailed information about the impact of individual genetic changes. This new method has the potential to improve our understanding of the evolution of the H3N2 virus and inform the development of more effective vaccines.
Researchers used a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to study how human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infects cells. They found that the virus requires the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis to enter the cell's nucleus. Normally, the nuclear envelope acts as a barrier between the nucleus and the rest of the cell. However, during mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down, allowing the virus to enter the nucleus. The researchers discovered that the virus's DNA (vDNA) and a protein called L2 associate with host cell chromatin on the metaphase plate during mitosis. This suggests that the breakdown of the nuclear envelope is necessary for the vDNA to enter the nucleus. The study also found that the virus causes cells to undergo prolonged mitosis, which may be a mechanism for the virus to promote vDNA import into the nucleus. The researchers propose that the breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis is a crucial step in the HPV16 infection process. The study highlights the importance of using RNAi screens to identify host cell factors and processes involved in viral infections, and provides a resource for future studies on virus-host cell interactions.
Black Sigatoka disease, caused by the fungus Pseudocercospora fijiensis, is a major threat to global banana production. The disease is difficult to control due to the lack of effective host resistance and the rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains. To combat this issue, researchers sequenced the genomes of two P. fijiensis strains, CIRAD86 and CIRAD139, using a new genetic linkage map. The 74-Mb genome of P. fijiensis is highly expanded by LTR retrotransposons, making it the largest genome within the Dothideomycetes. The study found that the genomes of two closely related members of the Sigatoka disease complex, P. eumusae and P. musae, are also expanded.

Genetic analysis revealed chromosome-length polymorphisms and high genetic diversity in P. fijiensis field populations, indicating strong selection and limited gene flow. The study also found that frequencies of fungicide resistance in fungicide-treated plantations were much higher than in untreated wild-type P. fijiensis populations. Researchers identified a homologue of the Cladosporium fulvum Avr4 effector, PfAvr4, in the P. fijiensis genome, which triggered a hypersensitive-like response in the resistant banana variety Calcutta 4. This suggests that Calcutta 4 may carry an unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAvr4.

The P. fijiensis genome will aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules and improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs. Diversifying and increasing the level of host resistance in banana may be the only way to slow the devastation caused by this fungus in the future.
Researchers have long believed that changes in the way genes are expressed play a significant role in the evolution of species-specific traits. However, current methods for studying these changes rely heavily on comparing the DNA sequences of different species, which can be inaccurate, especially in non-coding regions of the genome. A new study presents a novel approach that uses a "birth-death" model to track the evolution of regulatory elements, such as transcription factor binding sites, without relying on cross-species alignments. This method was applied to six transcription factors in humans and mice, and the results showed that a significant portion of binding sites in humans have originated since the species diverged from mice. In fact, over 15% of all binding sites are unique to humans and are often found near genes involved in specific pathways. These elements are also more likely to have common genetic variations, or SNPs, than older binding sites. The study's findings support the ability of this new method to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and shed light on their role in shaping gene regulation across species.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which light regulates the expression of the period2 (per2) gene in zebrafish, a vertebrate model for studying the circadian clock. The per2 gene plays a crucial role in mediating the effects of light on the circadian clock in zebrafish. A Light Responsive Module (LRM) within the per2 promoter was found to be necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian clock regulation. The LRM contains E- and D-box elements, which are critical for its function. The E-box directs circadian clock regulation by mediating BMAL/CLOCK activity, while the D-box confers light-driven expression. The zebrafish homolog of the thyrotroph embryonic factor (TEF) binds efficiently to the LRM D-box and transactivates expression. TEF mRNA levels were found to be light-inducible, and knockdown of TEF expression attenuated light-driven transcription from the per2 promoter in vivo. These findings support a model where a light-dependent crosstalk between E- and D-box binding factors is a central determinant of per2 expression. The LRM sequence is conserved in other vertebrate per2 genes, even in species lacking directly light-sensitive peripheral clocks. The human LRM can substitute for the zebrafish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zebrafish cells.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called coronin plays a crucial role in the motility of Plasmodium sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite. These parasites need to move through tissue barriers and into host cells to cause infection. The study found that coronin, which binds to actin filaments, is essential for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice. Without coronin, the parasites show motility defects that impair their ability to colonize the mosquito salivary glands, but not their ability to migrate in the skin.

The researchers used a combination of genetic and imaging techniques to study the role of coronin in Plasmodium sporozoites. They found that coronin localizes to the periphery of the parasite in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner. When extracellular ligands bind to the parasite, they trigger an intracellular calcium release, which leads to the relocalization of coronin to the rear of the gliding sporozoite and the initiation of motility.

The study suggests that coronin organizes actin filaments for productive motility and that protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly. The researchers also found that calcium and cAMP-mediated signaling regulate a switch from rapid parasite motility to host cell invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of Plasmodium sporozoite motility and highlights the importance of coronin in the transmission of malaria.
Amphotericin B (AmB) is a key treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. However, the potential for resistance to this drug is a significant concern. Researchers have identified four new lines of Leishmania mexicana that are resistant to AmB. These lines have altered sterol biosynthesis and are more sensitive to another drug, pentamidine. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that one line had a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol C5-desaturase. However, three other lines had reduced expression of the sterol C24-methyltransferase (SMT) gene, which is responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. SMT is encoded by two tandem gene copies, and reduced expression was associated with the loss of the 3' untranslated region of the dominant gene copy due to structural variations at this locus. These variations were linked to local regions of sequence homology and the presence of SIDER1 retrotransposon elements that promote multi-gene amplification. The loss of SMT expression was not associated with a loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo. This study highlights the potential for genomic instability at the SMT locus to contribute to AmB resistance in Leishmania parasites, which could have significant implications for the treatment of leishmaniasis.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain. They used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity from human observers performing a simple visual task. Participants either attended or ignored a stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. The results showed that surprising stimuli evoked neural responses that were encoded according to the difference between predicted and observed stimulus features. Attention facilitated the encoding of this type of information in the brain, particularly for mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli. This finding supports a recent version of predictive coding theory, which proposes that attention optimizes the expected precision of predictions by increasing the gain of prediction errors. The study found a significant effect of attention on mismatch response profiles in response to surprising stimuli, but not unpredictable stimuli. This suggests that attention boosts mismatch prediction errors evoked by surprising stimuli. The researchers used forward encoding models to quantify the selectivity for orientation and mismatch information in the neural responses to surprising and unpredictable stimuli. Their findings advance our understanding of how attention and prediction modulate information processing in the brain and support the theory that attention optimizes precision expectations during hierarchical inference by increasing the gain of prediction errors.
Researchers studied the differences in resistance to human serum between two sub-groups of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, known as group 1 and group 2. This parasite is a major cause of sleeping sickness in sub-Saharan Africa. Group 1 T. b. gambiense has an invariant resistance to human serum, while group 2 shows variable resistance. Previous studies suggested that group 1's resistance was due to reduced uptake of a protein called trypanosome lytic factor 1 (TLF-1), which is found in human serum. However, this study found that group 2 T. b. gambiense also resists TLF-1, but through a different mechanism. Both resistant and sensitive lines of group 2 T. b. gambiense express the same level of the TLF-1 receptor gene and internalize TLF-1 in the same way as other T. brucei parasites. The study also found that group 2 T. b. gambiense is resistant to another protein called APOL1, which is the main component of human serum that kills the parasite. This resistance to APOL1 may be due to the same mechanism as group 1 T. b. gambiense, but more research is needed to confirm this. The findings suggest that there are differences in the mechanisms of human serum resistance between group 1 and group 2 T. b. gambiense.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that helps HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, remain dormant in the body. This mechanism is called CpG methylation, which is a type of epigenetic modification that adds a chemical tag to the virus's genetic material. The study found that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) helps prevent the virus from reactivating, or becoming active again, in the body. This is important because reactivation of HIV-1 can lead to the progression of the disease.

The researchers used an in vitro model of reactivable latency and a latent reservoir of HIV-1-infected patients to study the role of CpG methylation in HIV-1 latency. They found that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5' LTR acts as a late event during the establishment of HIV-1 latency and is not required for the initial silencing of the virus. The study also found that the latent reservoir of some aviremic patients contained high proportions of non-methylated 5' LTR, suggesting that CpG methylation is not the only mechanism controlling HIV-1 latency.

The researchers propose a two-step model of epigenetic control of HIV-1 latency, which suggests that CpG methylation is an additional restriction mechanism that controls resistance of latent HIV-1 to reactivation signals and determines the stability of the HIV-1 latency. The study's findings have important implications for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have created a comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species commonly used in scientific research. The catalog includes over 3.6 million distinct genetic variations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, deletions, and complex variants. These variations were identified in 39 inbred lines of the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel.

The study found that the density of genetic variations is higher near other variations, but this is due to population-level processes rather than the variations themselves being mutagenic. The researchers also mapped cis-expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTLs) for over 2,000 genes in adult flies, revealing that insertions and deletions have a larger impact on gene expression than SNPs. The study found that most cis-eQTLs are sex-specific, indicating a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between males and females.

The researchers also performed RNA-seq-based allelic expression imbalance analyses in the offspring of crosses between sequenced lines, validating the majority of strong cis-eQTLs in heterozygous individuals. The study provides insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression variation in Drosophila and highlights the importance of genetic factors in mediating sex-biased gene expression. The comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in Drosophila will be a valuable resource for researchers studying the relationship between genetic and phenotypic variation.
Researchers investigated how amplitude cancellation affects the relationship between the neural drive to muscle and the rectified electromyography (EMG) signal. Amplitude cancellation occurs when motor unit action potentials overlap, reducing the EMG signal's amplitude. This can distort the EMG signal's spectrum and its correlation with the neural drive. The study used analytical derivations and a computational model to simulate motor neuron activity, force, and EMG signals. The results showed that an ideal EMG signal without amplitude cancellation (EMGnc) is a better estimator of the neural drive than the actual rectified EMG signal. However, the correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive decreased linearly with increasing amplitude cancellation, especially at high contraction levels. The simulations also found that a stronger neural drive resulted in a stronger correlation between the rectified EMG and the neural drive, but amplitude cancellation distorted this correlation mainly for low-frequency components of the neural drive. The study concluded that amplitude cancellation impairs the ability of the rectified EMG signal to accurately reflect the neural drive to the muscle, except in conditions with low contraction levels and/or highly variable common synaptic input. The results suggest that valid use of the rectified EMG as an estimator of the neural drive requires low contraction levels and/or strong common synaptic input to the motor neurons.
Scientists have long known that the hormone auxin plays a crucial role in regulating root growth in plants, particularly in response to aluminum (Al) stress. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling this process were not well understood. Researchers have now identified a key player in this process: the YUCCA (YUC) family of proteins. YUC proteins regulate the production of auxin in the root apex transition zone (TZ), a region critical for root growth. When plants are exposed to Al stress, YUC3, YUC5, YUC7, YUC8, and YUC9 are upregulated in the root-apex TZ, leading to an accumulation of auxin and subsequent root growth inhibition. This process is dependent on ethylene signaling, a hormone that helps plants respond to stress. The researchers found that increasing or disrupting ethylene signaling altered the upregulation of YUCs in response to Al stress. Furthermore, they discovered that ethylene-insensitive 3 (EIN3) directly regulates the transcription of YUC9, while phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF4) acts as a transcriptional activator for YUC5, YUC8, and YUC9. PIF4 promotes Al-inhibited primary root growth by regulating the local expression of YUCs and auxin signals in the root-apex TZ. The study reveals a regulatory cascade involving YUCs, ethylene signaling, and PIF4 that mediates root growth inhibition in response to Al stress.
Researchers have found that certain peptides from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can suppress the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in rhesus macaques. NK cells are a type of immune cell that helps protect against viral infections. The SIV peptides bind to a molecule called Mamu-A1*002, which is found on the surface of infected cells. This binding stabilizes the interaction between Mamu-A1*002 and another molecule called Mamu-KIR3DL05, which is found on NK cells. As a result, the NK cells are less effective at killing the infected cells.

The researchers tested 75 different SIV peptides and found that 28 of them suppressed the activity of NK cells. These peptides were able to inhibit the killing of infected cells by Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells, but not by Mamu-KIR3DL05- NK cells. The peptides with the highest affinity for Mamu-A1*002 were the most effective at suppressing NK cell activity. These peptides may be presented at a higher density on the surface of infected cells, making them more effective at suppressing NK cell responses.

The researchers also found that SIV replication was higher in cells co-cultured with Mamu-KIR3DL05+ NK cells than in cells co-cultured with Mamu-KIR3DL05- NK cells. This suggests that the suppression of NK cell activity by SIV peptides may be a mechanism by which the virus evades the immune system.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, a common cause of ear infections, adapts to survive in the human body. They found that when the bacterium is exposed to limited nutrients, it undergoes genetic changes that help it thrive in the ear. Specifically, a mutation in a gene called icc leads to a decrease in an enzyme that breaks down a molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). This change allows the bacterium to form communities within the cells of the ear, making it harder for the immune system to clear the infection.

In a laboratory model of ear infection, the researchers found that the mutated bacterium formed more of these intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the original strain. However, the number of IBCs formed by the original strain increased over time, suggesting that it too can adapt to the ear environment. The researchers also found that the mutated bacterium was less likely to be cleared from the ear, even after the infection had resolved, indicating that it can persist in the body.

These findings provide new insights into how Haemophilus influenzae adapts to the human body and how it can cause chronic infections. The study suggests that the bacterium's ability to form IBCs may be a key factor in its ability to persist in the ear and evade the immune system. Further research is needed to understand the implications of these findings for the treatment and prevention of ear infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, interacts with its host's iron metabolism. Iron is essential for both bacterial growth and the host's immune response. The study found that B. pseudomallei downregulates the expression of ferroportin, a protein that exports iron from host cells, leading to increased iron availability within the cells. This allows the bacteria to grow and survive inside the host cells. The researchers also found that supplementing the host cells with iron increased bacterial growth, while limiting iron availability reduced bacterial survival. In mice infected with B. pseudomallei, the bacteria caused a decrease in ferroportin expression, leading to higher iron retention in the liver and lower iron levels in the blood. Administering iron to infected mice promoted bacterial growth and inflammation, while limiting iron availability improved bacterial clearance and reduced inflammation. The study suggests that B. pseudomallei modulates the host's iron balance to facilitate its growth and survival, and that iron chelating drugs may be a potential therapeutic option for treating melioidosis. The findings provide new insights into the role of iron in the host-pathogen interaction and highlight the importance of iron homeostasis in the immune response to B. pseudomallei infection.
Researchers have developed a new technique called functional mode analysis (FMA) to identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to their biological function. Traditional methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and normal mode analysis (NMA), focus on large-scale and low-frequency motions, but may not necessarily reveal functionally relevant motions. FMA, on the other hand, uses an arbitrary "functional quantity" to quantify the protein's functional state and detects the collective motion that is maximally correlated to it. This approach can be applied to various types of functional quantities, including geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observables.

The technique uses two correlation measures: the Pearson correlation coefficient, which assesses linear correlation, and mutual information, which can detect any kind of interdependence. By identifying the maximally correlated motion, FMA allows researchers to derive a model for the functional state in terms of a single collective coordinate. The new approach has been illustrated using several biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein. FMA is expected to be particularly useful for proteins where it is unclear how functionally relevant quantities are related to collective atomic motions.
Researchers studied how introns, non-coding parts of genes, are removed from the nuclear transcripts of Euglena gracilis, a type of eukaryotic cell. They focused on two genes, tubA and gapC, which contain both conventional and nonconventional introns. Nonconventional introns are unique to euglenids and marine diplonemids and do not have the typical characteristics of spliceosomal introns. These introns form a stable secondary structure but do not resemble self-splicing or tRNA introns.

The study found that nonconventional introns are removed from the transcripts more quickly than conventional introns. However, they are removed after the conventional introns. This suggests that there may be a time gap between the removal of conventional and nonconventional introns. The researchers used the PacBio Next Generation Sequencing system to analyze the intermediate products of splicing and confirm their findings.

The study provides new insights into the splicing process in euglenids and marine diplonemids. It also highlights the unique characteristics of nonconventional introns, which are distinct from those found in other eukaryotes. The results suggest that the removal of nonconventional introns is a rapid process that occurs after the removal of conventional introns. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of splicing in these organisms and the role of nonconventional introns in their genomes.
Researchers investigated the long-term effects of a mild coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection in infants on the development of the heart. They used a mouse model to study the impact of the virus on cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs), which are essential for the growth and repair of the heart. The study found that a subclinical dose of CVB3, which caused no immediate symptoms, led to a significant reduction in the number of CPCs in the hearts of infected mice. This reduction persisted into adulthood, even after the virus had been cleared from the heart.

When the infected adult mice were subjected to cardiac stress, such as intense swimming, they developed heart failure, characterized by cardiac hypertrophy and dilation. In contrast, uninfected mice were able to adapt to the stress by increasing the formation of new blood vessels in the heart. However, the infected mice were unable to do so, suggesting that the reduced number of CPCs impaired the heart's ability to adapt to increased load.

The study also found that the virus preferentially infected CPCs in the juvenile heart, leading to their premature differentiation or death. This suggests that even mild CVB3 infections in infancy may have long-term consequences for the development and function of the heart. The findings provide new insights into the potential mechanisms underlying the association between early subclinical infections and late-onset heart failure.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, which causes melioidosis, interacts with immune cells called macrophages. They found that in the early stages of infection, the bacterium activates a cell death pathway called pyroptosis, which is dependent on a protein called NLRC4. This pathway leads to the activation of caspase-1, an enzyme that plays a key role in cell death. However, at later stages of infection, the researchers found that caspase-1 activation and cell death occur independently of NLRC4.

The study also identified a pathway involving caspases-9, -7, and PARP that is activated downstream of NLRC4 and caspase-1 in the early phase of infection. Additionally, the researchers found that a protein called BopE, which is part of the bacterium's T3SS3 system, plays a role in caspase-1 processing. They also found that a mutant of the T3SS3 inner rod protein BsaK failed to activate caspase-1, leading to reduced cell death and IL-1β secretion in macrophages.

Intranasal infection of mice with the BsaK mutant resulted in decreased mortality, lower bacterial loads in organs, and reduced levels of IL-1β, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These findings suggest that the T3SS3 system plays a major role in early NLRC4-mediated caspase-1 activation and pyroptosis, and that late caspase-1-dependent and -independent cell death mechanisms contribute to the pathogenesis of B. pseudomallei infection.
Researchers studied the role of the Arabidopsis KINβγ protein in pollen germination on the stigma, a critical step in plant reproduction. They found that KINβγ is a key regulator of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in pollen, which is essential for pollen hydration and germination on the stigma. In Arabidopsis plants with a mutated KINβγ gene, pollen could not germinate on the stigma, even though it germinated normally in a controlled environment. The researchers discovered that the mutation led to defective biogenesis of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, resulting in reduced ROS levels. They also found that adding water to the stigma promoted germination of the mutant pollen, suggesting that compromised hydration was the primary issue. Furthermore, the study showed that reducing ROS levels in pollen by overexpressing an enzyme called catalase resulted in impaired pollen hydration on the stigma. These findings indicate that Arabidopsis KINβγ plays a crucial role in regulating ROS levels by controlling the formation of mitochondria and peroxisomes in pollen, which is necessary for successful pollination. The research provides new insights into the complex interactions between pollen and the stigma, highlighting the importance of KINβγ in plant reproduction.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two prophages, Skin and SPβ. Prophages are viruses that infect bacteria, and in this case, the toxin genes they carry can harm the host cell. RNase III works by degrading double-stranded RNA, a type of genetic material, and in B. subtilis, it specifically targets two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txpA and yonT. These mRNAs are produced by the prophages and would normally be translated into toxic proteins that could harm the cell. By degrading these mRNAs, RNase III prevents the production of these toxins, allowing the cell to survive. The researchers found that in the absence of these prophages or the toxin-encoding mRNAs, the RNase III gene can be deleted without affecting the cell's growth rate. This suggests that RNase III's primary function in B. subtilis is not related to its role in ribosomal RNA maturation, as it is in other bacteria. Instead, its essential function is to protect the cell from the toxins produced by the prophages. This study highlights the unique role of RNase III in B. subtilis and its importance in the cell's defense against viral infections.
Researchers studied the filarial nematode Brugia malayi, a parasite that causes Lymphatic Filariasis, to understand how it interacts with its host. They found that the parasite releases tiny vesicles called extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain bioactive proteins and small RNA species. These EVs are secreted by all stages of the parasite's life cycle, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult males, and females. The researchers used a technique called Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis to quantify and size the EVs, revealing discrete populations and a conserved secretory process across the life cycle. They also found that the EVs are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector molecule trafficking.

Proteomic profiling of adult male and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the adult EV proteome, helping to define the biogenesis of Brugia EVs and revealing sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo. The researchers also found that the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin rapidly inhibits EV release by all Brugia life stages. This effect was also observed in the related filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis, but not in an ivermectin-unresponsive field isolate of that parasite. This suggests a potential mechanism of action for ivermectin and may lead to new screening platforms for anti-filarial drug development. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Brugia malayi interacts with its host and may have implications for the development of new treatments for Lymphatic Filariasis.
A recent study conducted in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands found that scabies and impetigo are highly prevalent in the region. The study, which included 1,908 participants from ten rural villages, reported a total unweighted prevalence of scabies at 19.2% and active impetigo at 32.7%. The prevalence of scabies was highest in infants under one year of age, at 34.1%, and in children aged 1-4 years, at 25.7%. Impetigo was also most common in children aged 1-4 years, at 42.6%. The study found a strong association between scabies infestation and active impetigo infection, with 41.1% of active impetigo cases also having scabies. The researchers suggest that community control strategies for scabies may help reduce the burden of both conditions and their downstream complications. The study's findings are consistent with other studies in the Pacific region, which have reported high prevalence rates of scabies and impetigo. However, the study highlights the need for further development of standardized clinical criteria and algorithms for diagnosing scabies and impetigo in field settings to facilitate more accurate data collection and comparisons of global epidemiological data.
Researchers studied the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the adult hippocampus of mice. They found a significant correlation between the proportions of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. This correlation was due to shared genetic loci, except for the H-2Ea locus, which had a dominant influence on T cell subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. Analysis of knockout and repopulation of TCRα-deficient mice confirmed the influence of T cells on adult neurogenesis, indicating that CD4+ T cells or subpopulations thereof mediate the effect.

The study used a large stock of outbred mice to examine the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus. They found that higher levels of hippocampal proliferation were associated with a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells and lower proportions of CD4+ T cells, resulting in a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio. The correlation accounted for about 6% of the phenotypic variance and was far more significant than with any other phenotype.

The researchers suggest that T cells play a broader role in adult neurogenesis than previously suspected, and that natural genetic variation that controls T cell development and homeostasis has an organismal impact. The study's findings extend previous observations that T cells contribute to variation in adult neurogenesis and provide new insights into the relationship between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus.
Researchers have developed a vaccine called TcVac2 to protect against Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and an emerging infectious disease in the US. Chagas disease is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which can lead to serious heart and digestive problems. The vaccine, TcVac2, is a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine that targets specific antigens identified through computational analysis of the T. cruzi sequence database. In a study, mice were immunized with TcVac2 and then challenged with the parasite. The results showed that the vaccine induced a strong antibody response and a moderate level of lymphocyte proliferation in the mice. Upon challenge infection, the vaccinated mice expanded their antibody response and elicited a substantial CD8+ T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines, which helped control the acute parasite burden. In the chronic phase, the antibody response persisted, but the CD8+ T cell response and pro-inflammatory cytokines subsided, and anti-inflammatory cytokines became dominant in the vaccinated mice. Histological analysis revealed that the vaccine prevented tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in the heart and skeletal muscle of the vaccinated mice. In contrast, mice that did not receive the vaccine showed persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in the myocardium. The study demonstrates the protective efficacy of TcVac2 against acute T. cruzi infection and the prevention of chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts.
Researchers have used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genetic markers linked to type 1 diabetes (T1D), but the next step is to use this information to predict an individual's risk of developing the disease. A team of scientists applied a machine-learning approach called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to a large dataset of genetic information from people with and without T1D. They found that by using hundreds of genetic markers, the SVM algorithm was able to accurately predict an individual's risk of developing T1D, with an accuracy of around 84%. This is a significant improvement over previous studies that used only a few known genetic markers, which achieved much lower accuracy.

The researchers tested their approach on three different datasets and found that it worked well in all of them. They also showed that the SVM algorithm can take into account interactions between multiple genetic markers, which is important for accurately predicting disease risk. The study suggests that it may be possible to use genetic information to predict an individual's risk of developing T1D and potentially other complex diseases. This could lead to more targeted and effective prevention and treatment strategies. The researchers are optimistic that their approach can be applied to other diseases where a significant proportion of the risk has already been captured by genetic markers.
Researchers studied how memory CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell, respond to a viral infection in the skin. They found that these cells can quickly move into the skin and provide protection against the virus without relying on a specific molecule called CD62L, which is often used to identify a subset of these cells called central memory (TCM) CD8+ T cells. In fact, TCM CD8+ T cells can become tissue-resident cells in the skin, meaning they stay in the skin and continue to provide protection even after the initial infection has cleared. This is in contrast to another subset of memory CD8+ T cells called effector memory (TEM) CD8+ T cells, which do not become tissue-resident cells. The researchers also found that TCM CD8+ T cells can become cytolytic, meaning they can kill infected cells, and use this ability to provide protection against the virus. This study provides new insights into how memory CD8+ T cells work to protect against viral infections in the skin and has implications for the development of vaccines and treatments. The findings suggest that TCM CD8+ T cells play a key role in providing protection against viral infections in the skin, and that their ability to rapidly traffic into the skin and become tissue-resident cells is an important feature of their protective function.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for Myosin VI, a type of motor protein, in the localization of proteins on the surface of axons in neurons. Axons and dendrites, the two main parts of a neuron, have distinct molecular compositions and functions, but the mechanisms behind this polarization are not well understood. Myosin VI, which moves towards the minus end of actin filaments, was found to play a vital role in enriching proteins on the surface of axons. When a non-neuronal protein was engineered to interact with Myosin VI, it became highly concentrated at the axonal surface in rat cortical neurons. Conversely, disrupting Myosin VI function or expression led to aberrant localization of axonal proteins to dendrites. The study suggests that Myosin VI stimulates dendrite-specific endocytosis, a process that contributes to the localization of many axonal proteins. Additionally, a modified version of the protein Channelrhodopsin 2, engineered to bind to Myosin VI, was found to be concentrated at the axonal surface of cortical neurons in mice in vivo. These findings indicate that myosins, including Myosin VI, help shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, which is essential for proper electrical signaling in neurons.
Researchers have identified two Doublesex (Dsx) genes in the freshwater branchiopod crustacean Daphnia magna, a species that can produce males in response to environmental cues. One of these genes, DapmaDsx1, is responsible for male trait development when expressed during environmental sex determination. The domain organization of DapmaDsx1 is similar to that of Dsx in insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for the sexually dimorphic expression of DapmaDsx1 is different from that of insects. Instead of being regulated by sex-specific pre-mRNA splicing, DapmaDsx1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in the abundance of its transcripts. During embryogenesis, expression of DapmaDsx1 is increased only in males, and its transcripts are primarily detected in male-specific structures. Knocking down DapmaDsx1 in male embryos resulted in the production of female traits, including ovarian maturation, while ectopic expression of DapmaDsx1 in female embryos resulted in the development of male-like phenotypes. These findings establish DapmaDsx1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype and reveal how environmental sex determination is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component that is functionally conserved in animals using genetic sex determination.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine to prevent genital herpes, a common sexually transmitted infection caused by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). The vaccine, which contains three proteins from the virus, was tested in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs. In the macaques, the vaccine triggered the production of antibodies that can neutralize the virus and block its ability to evade the immune system. The vaccine also stimulated the activation of immune cells called CD4 T cells, which play a key role in fighting off infections. When the macaques were challenged with the virus, those that received the vaccine developed a mild and short-lived infection, while those that did not receive the vaccine developed a more severe infection. In guinea pigs, the vaccine was 97-99% effective in preventing genital lesions, which are a hallmark of genital herpes. The vaccine also reduced the amount of virus shed in the vagina, making it less likely to be transmitted to others. The researchers found that adding a booster dose of one of the proteins in the vaccine did not significantly improve its effectiveness. Overall, the results suggest that this vaccine has the potential to prevent genital herpes in humans and reduce the risk of HIV transmission associated with the infection.
Researchers have developed a new method called Perm-seq to map protein-DNA interactions in regions of the genome that are difficult to study due to their repetitive nature. These regions, known as segmental duplications, play a significant role in cells' regulatory programs. Current methods for studying protein-DNA interactions, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq), struggle to accurately map reads from these regions because they can map to multiple locations in the genome. This leads to a high rate of false positives and negatives.

Perm-seq uses additional data types, including DNase-seq and histone ChIP-seq, to improve the accuracy of read mapping in these regions. The method capitalizes on the fact that DNase-seq can identify open chromatin regions that are often associated with transcription factor occupancy. By incorporating this information, Perm-seq can allocate multi-mapping reads with high accuracy.

The researchers applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from two cell types and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. These interactions were found to share similar chromatin signatures with those in non-repetitive regions, despite being less conserved evolutionarily. The Perm-seq framework is versatile and can incorporate multiple sources of data, including histone ChIP-seq, to improve read allocation accuracy. Overall, Perm-seq provides a valuable tool for studying protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of the genome.
Researchers conducted a study in Tanzania to investigate the relationship between schistosomiasis and HIV-1 infection. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that affects 218 million people worldwide, mostly in Africa. The study found that women with schistosomiasis were 2.8 times more likely to become infected with HIV-1 than those without the infection. In contrast, men with schistosomiasis did not have an increased risk of HIV-1 infection. The study also found that women with schistosomiasis who became infected with HIV-1 had higher levels of the virus in their blood at the time of infection compared to women without schistosomiasis. This suggests that schistosomiasis may impair the immune system's ability to control HIV-1 infection in women. The study's findings have important implications for understanding how schistosomiasis may contribute to the spread of HIV-1 in Africa, where both infections are common. The study's results also highlight the need for further research on the relationship between schistosomiasis and HIV-1 infection in different populations.
Researchers have found that the number of copies of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in human and mouse genomes can change in cancer. Contrary to expectations, cancer genomes often have fewer copies of rDNA than normal genomes. This loss of copies is associated with increased activity of the mTOR kinase pathway, which is involved in cell growth and proliferation. The PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor that regulates the mTOR pathway, is also linked to rDNA copy number. In a mouse model of leukemia, hematopoietic stem cells with low rDNA copy number were found to be more sensitive to DNA damage. This suggests that rDNA copy number may be a useful indicator of whether a cancer will respond to DNA-damaging treatments. The study used computational and droplet digital PCR approaches to measure rDNA copy number in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. The results show that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer, and that high mTOR activity is associated with a loss of copies and increased sensitivity to DNA damage. The findings have implications for understanding the relationship between rDNA copy number and cancer, and may lead to new approaches for targeting cancer cells with low rDNA copy number.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study how bacteria grow and spread within the body during an infection. They used a technique called quantitative PCR to track the growth and death of tagged bacterial populations in mice infected with Salmonella enterica. This allowed them to estimate the rate at which the bacteria died off over time. The study found that shortly after infection, the bacteria rapidly multiplied and established separate populations in different organs, such as the spleen and liver. This process was controlled by the host's immune system. As the infection progressed, the death rate of the bacteria decreased, leading to an exponential increase in their numbers. The bacteria then spread locally and mixed between organs through the bloodstream, resulting in further selection of bacterial subpopulations. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Salmonella infections and highlights the complex spatial and stochastic effects that drive the disease. The researchers believe that their approach can be applied to other host-pathogen combinations to gain a comprehensive understanding of within-host dynamics.
Existing models of 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity, are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion. The inverse problem refers to determining the 3D motion of an object based on 2D visual information. Researchers suggest that local velocity constraints, combined with binocular disparity and other depth cues, provide a more flexible framework for solving this problem. In the context of the aperture problem, two default strategies are proposed: the vector normal, which prefers slow motion in 3D, and the cyclopean average, which is based on slow motion in 2D. Predicting perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion can help distinguish between these strategies. Theoretical results indicate that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are necessary to solve the inverse problem of 3D motion perception. Parallel processing and late integration of motion and disparity, as well as other cues, appear to be a convincing solution to the inverse problem. This approach allows the visual system to remain flexible when binding and segmenting local inputs from different processing stages into a global 3D motion percept. The intersection of two constraint planes in a given binocular viewing geometry defines a constraint line oriented in 3D velocity space, providing a flexible strategy to disambiguate 3D motion direction and solve the inverse problem.
Researchers studied the role of two proteins, AlgJ and AlgX, in the production of a protective layer called alginate by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This layer helps the bacteria survive in the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis. The scientists determined the structure of AlgJ and found that it is similar to another protein, AlgX, but has a different surface charge. They also discovered that AlgJ has a conserved catalytic triad, which is a group of three amino acids that work together to perform a specific function. This suggests that AlgJ has acetylesterase activity, which is the ability to remove an acetyl group from a molecule.

The researchers used a technique called mass spectrometry to compare the ability of AlgJ and AlgX to bind to and acetylate alginate. They found that AlgX binds to alginate specifically and can use a surrogate acetyl donor to add an acetyl group to the molecule. In contrast, AlgJ does not bind to alginate well and does not use the surrogate acetyl donor. These results suggest that AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in the acetylation of alginate. The researchers propose that AlgX is the terminal acetyltransferase, which means it adds the final acetyl group to the alginate molecule. This study provides new insights into the complex process of alginate acetylation and the roles of AlgJ and AlgX in this process.
Candida albicans is a common cause of human fungal infections and can evade detection by the immune system by masking its cell wall component β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan with a layer of glycosylated mannoproteins. However, when the cell wall is disrupted, β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan is exposed and can be detected by the immune system through receptors like Dectin-1. Research has shown that the phospholipid phosphatidylserine ( PS ) plays a role in masking β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan, and a mutant strain of C. albicans with a disrupted PS synthase gene ( cho1Δ/Δ ) exhibits increased exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan. The study found that the Cek1 MAPK pathway is activated in the cho1Δ/Δ mutant and is responsible for the increased exposure of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan. The Cek1 pathway is activated downstream of the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rho1, which are involved in cell wall biogenesis and remodeling. Hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells also increased β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure and activation of the Cek1 pathway. Additionally, independent hyperactivation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase Ste11 led to Cek1 activation and increased β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan exposure. These findings suggest that the Cek1 pathway plays a key role in the unmasking of β ( 1, 3 ) -glucan in C. albicans and may be a target for improving anti-fungal strategies.
Researchers conducted a large-scale genetic study to better understand the underlying causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. They analyzed data from 4,914 brain autopsies to identify genetic variants associated with the disease. The study found that certain genetic variants, including those near the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, were strongly linked to AD dementia and specific neuropathologic features, such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Additionally, the study identified new genetic associations with specific neuropathologic features, including cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Lewy body disease, hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly, and vascular brain injury.

The researchers also found that 12 out of 21 previously identified genetic risk loci for clinically-defined AD dementia were confirmed in their study. These loci included CR1, BIN1, CLU, MS4A6A, PICALM, ABCA7, CD33, PTK2B, SORL1, MEF2C, ZCWPW1, and CASS4. The study's findings suggest that these genetic variants may play a role in the development of specific neuropathologic features of AD.

The study's results provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD and related dementias. They also highlight the potential for genetic stratification of risk for these diseases, which could lead to more targeted and effective treatments. The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between genetics and neuropathology in AD and related dementias.
Scientists have long used a chemical called urea to study how proteins unfold, but its exact role in this process has remained unclear. A new study used computer simulations to analyze the behavior of 30 different proteins in the presence of urea. The researchers found that urea does not simply stabilize the unfolded state of proteins, but rather actively helps to unfold them. Urea molecules tend to accumulate on the surface of folded proteins, where they interact with the protein's atoms through weak forces called van der Waals interactions and hydrogen bonds. These interactions slow down the protein's vibrations, making it more likely to unfold. The study also found that urea's slow diffusion and "stickiness" play a crucial role in unfolding, as it helps to stabilize partially open protein structures that are generated by thermal fluctuations. The researchers conclude that urea does not simply displace water molecules from the protein surface, but rather actively favors unfolding by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded states. This new understanding of urea's role in protein unfolding has important implications for our understanding of protein behavior and could potentially be used to develop new treatments for diseases related to protein misfolding. The study's findings provide a robust and complete picture of the role of urea in destabilizing folded states of proteins and accelerating protein unfolding.
A systematic review of epidemiological studies on dengue disease in Colombia between 2000 and 2012 found that the country experienced a stable annual number of dengue fever cases, punctuated by major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of the disease increased over the review period, with most of the country affected by the 2010 outbreak. The majority of dengue cases were among those under 15 years of age.

The review identified gaps in knowledge about dengue disease in Colombia, including the rates of asymptomatic infections, primary and secondary infections, and under-reporting of the disease. Improved surveillance methods are needed to address these gaps. Nationwide surveillance data showed a 90% increase in the number of municipalities reporting dengue cases between 2000 and 2010, from 424 to 743. The incidence of dengue was generally low in south and south-east Colombia, where the population density is lowest.

Dengue disease is a significant public health concern in Colombia, and controlling the disease has been challenging. The review highlights the need for further research to understand the factors that determine disease expression and to improve disease control and management. The findings of this review contribute to a broader series of studies on the epidemiology of dengue disease in the Americas and Asia.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL), a disease caused by Leishmania parasites, often co-occurs with other pathogens in human populations. This review aims to summarize the frequency of TL coinfections, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens, and implications for clinical practice. A comprehensive search of medical literature identified 73 records, including 21 experimental studies in animals and 52 studies in human subjects. The review found that coinfections with Trypanosoma cruzi and helminths are common in TL patients in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. However, the mechanisms of interaction between different microorganisms are not well understood and may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting the quality and quantity of acquired immune responses. Coinfections can lead to diagnostic errors and delays, and may reduce the effectiveness of antileishmanial treatment. Some coinfections, such as helminthiasis, can also cause cumulative adverse effects when combined with antileishmanial drugs. The review highlights the need for further research to understand how coinfections interfere with the pathogenesis of TL and to develop effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with TL and coinfections.
Researchers studied how genetic variations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) affect the development of immune cells called T cells in rats. The MHC is a group of genes that play a crucial role in the immune system, and variations in these genes can influence how well the immune system functions. The researchers used two genetic models, the NIH-Heterogenous Stock (HS) rats and a panel of MHC-recombinant congenic strains, to study the effects of genetic variation on MHC expression and T cell development. They found that genetic variations in the MHC region were associated with differences in the ratio of CD4 to CD8 T cells, which are two types of immune cells that play different roles in the immune response.

The researchers identified 10 Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs), which are regions of the genome associated with specific traits, across the genome and found that QTLs for MHC class I and II protein expression and the CD4:CD8 T cell ratio colocalized within a region spanning the MHC. They then refined the QTLs to two adjacent intervals in the MHC-I and II regions and found that an interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression and the development of CD8 T cells. The researchers mapped this effect to the transporter associated with antigen processing 2 (Tap2) in the MHC-II region and the classical MHC class I gene (RT1-A) in the MHC-I region. They found that a recombination between RT1-A and Tap2, which occurred in 0.2% of the rats, affected the development of CD8 T cells.
A study analyzed hospital discharge records in Spain from 1997 to 2011 to understand the evolution of Chagas disease in the country. Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant public health concern in Latin America, and Spain receives a large number of migrants from the region. The study found that hospitalization rates for Chagas disease increased from 18 per 100,000 population in 1997-2004 to 242.8 per 100,000 population in 2005-2011. The majority of hospitalizations (75.3%) were related to Chagas disease without organ complications, while 23.4% involved organ complications, with heart complications being the most common. The study also found that being male, aged 45-64 years, and having a higher hospitalization cost were associated with a higher risk of organ complications. The majority of patients (74%) were female, and the 16-45 age group was most represented. The study highlights the need for increased efforts towards early detection of T. cruzi infections, particularly among asymptomatic women of childbearing age. The findings suggest that Chagas disease is a significant public health concern in Spain, and a systematic approach is needed to detect and control the disease.
Researchers have developed a new approach called BlocBuster to identify combinations of genetic factors that contribute to complex diseases, such as psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that affects millions of people worldwide, and its genetic causes are not yet fully understood. Traditional genetic studies, known as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have identified hundreds of genetic markers associated with psoriasis, but these markers only explain a small portion of the disease's heritability.

BlocBuster is a novel systems-level approach that efficiently constructs genome-wide, allele-specific networks to identify combinations of genetic factors that are associated with a given disease. The researchers applied BlocBuster to analyze psoriasis data and discovered a combinatorial pattern of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that is significantly associated with the disease. This pattern, known as ps_1, has an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16, indicating a strong association with psoriasis.

The BlocBuster approach improves upon previous results by providing a precise allelic pattern within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, which is a key region involved in the immune system. The researchers validated their results using independent data and found that the combinatorial pattern was robust and consistent. This study demonstrates the potential of BlocBuster to discover combinatorial genetic associations within heterogeneous genome-wide data, which could lead to a better understanding of the genetic causes of complex diseases like psoriasis.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate the genetic causes of three severe congenital brain malformations: agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC), cerebellar hypoplasia (CBLH), and polymicrogyria (PMG). They analyzed chromosomal copy number variations (CNVs) in 255 ACC, 220 CBLH, and 147 PMG patients, as well as 2,349 control individuals. The study found that ACC patients had a significantly higher prevalence of rare genic CNVs, which are CNVs that impact at least one gene in less than 1% of the population, compared to controls. Specifically, 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which are CNVs that occur for the first time in a family. These de novo CNVs were more likely to overlap with those previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders. In contrast, CBLH and PMG patients did not have a significantly higher prevalence of rare genic CNVs compared to controls. The study also identified six novel CNVs in ACC patients that are likely to be deleterious, and confirmed and refined previously known CNVs, including a duplication at 8p23.1-p11.1 that is present in 2% of the ACC cohort. The findings suggest that ACC has a distinct genetic profile compared to CBLH and PMG, and highlight the importance of investigating the genetic causes of these brain malformations.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called Yorkie (Yki) in the regeneration of planarians, a type of flatworm. Planarians have the ability to regrow lost body parts, making them an ideal model for studying regeneration. The study found that when Yki is inhibited, the planarian's response to injury is hyper-activated, leading to increased stem cell proliferation and a prolonged transcriptional wound response. This means that the planarian's cells are more active and produce more genes in response to injury.

The researchers also found that the inhibition of Yki leads to an increase in the number of epidermal and muscle cells, which are the sources of wound-induced genes. Additionally, the study showed that the brain, gut, and midline of the planarian are unable to remodel and scale correctly to the size of the regenerating fragment when Yki is inhibited. This suggests that Yki plays a crucial role in integrating multiple aspects of the injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning.

The study's findings suggest that Yki acts as a key molecule that regulates the planarian's response to injury. The researchers propose that Yki's effects on the wound response are direct, as they detected increased expression of key genes in the wound program in intact animals prior to any injury. The study provides new insights into the complex processes involved in regeneration and the role of Yki in regulating the planarian's response to injury.
Researchers have discovered that exosomes, tiny vesicles released by infected cells, play a key role in the spread of the EV71 virus. Exosomes can transfer genetic material between cells, including viral RNA and a specific microRNA called miR-146a. When EV71 infects a cell, it triggers the release of exosomes that contain both the viral RNA and miR-146a. The miR-146a in these exosomes suppresses the production of type I interferon, a protein that helps fight off viral infections. This suppression allows the viral RNA in the exosomes to replicate in new cells, facilitating the spread of the virus. The researchers found that the exosomes can transfer the viral RNA to new cells and replicate it, while the miR-146a in the exosomes suppresses the type I interferon response, making it easier for the virus to infect the new cells. The study also showed that certain proteins, called ISGs, play a role in regulating the release of exosomes by EV71-infected cells. In addition, the researchers found that the exosomal viral RNA accumulates differently in various tissues compared to free virus particles. Overall, the study provides evidence that exosomes secreted by EV71-infected cells selectively package high levels of miR-146a, which can be transferred to and facilitate the replication of exosomal EV71 RNA in recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response.
Researchers studied the relationship between two genes, PINK1 and Parkin, which are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. PINK1 is a protein that helps maintain healthy mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, while Parkin is a protein that helps remove damaged mitochondria. The study used fruit flies (Drosophila) to investigate how PINK1 and Parkin interact. They identified a protein called PGAM5, which binds to PINK1, and found that it plays a crucial role in regulating the PINK1 pathway. When PGAM5 is lost, it suppresses the muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan caused by PINK1 inactivation. However, PGAM5 does not affect the phenotypes associated with Parkin mutations. The study suggests that PGAM5 acts between PINK1 and Parkin, or independently of Parkin, to maintain mitochondrial health. The researchers propose that PGAM5 could be a potential therapeutic target for treating Parkinson's disease caused by PINK1 mutations. Further research is needed to understand how PGAM5 regulates the PINK1 pathway and to explore its potential as a treatment for Parkinson's disease.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ in the immune response to Mycobacterium ulcerans, the bacteria that causes Buruli ulcer, a chronic skin disease. They used a mouse model to study the progression of the infection in mice with and without interferon-γ. The results showed that mice lacking interferon-γ had a faster and more severe progression of the disease, with more tissue damage and a higher bacterial load. This suggests that interferon-γ plays a crucial role in early immune defense against M. ulcerans infection. Interferon-γ activates macrophages to kill intracellular bacteria, and its absence allows the bacteria to multiply unchecked. The study supports the idea that the immune response to M. ulcerans is similar to that against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and that interferon-γ is a key component of this response. The findings have implications for the development of vaccines against Buruli ulcer, and suggest that concepts developed for tuberculosis vaccines may also be effective against M. ulcerans. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the early stages of M. ulcerans infection, as the bacteria can produce a toxin that kills host cells and causes tissue damage. Overall, the research provides new insights into the immune response to M. ulcerans and may lead to the development of new treatments for Buruli ulcer.
Researchers have been trying to understand how mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under low oxygen conditions, known as anoxia. ROS production is linked to various diseases, but the mechanism behind it is not fully understood. A team of scientists developed a new method to mathematically model the process of electron transport in mitochondria, which allowed them to identify two stable states of operation for the respiratory complex III. Normally, this complex produces low levels of ROS, but under anoxia, it can switch to a high ROS-producing state that persists even after oxygen levels return to normal. This phenomenon, known as bistability, explains why anoxia can cause cell damage. The researchers validated their prediction experimentally and suggest that recognizing this bistability could lead to new therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. Their method of modeling could also be applied to other complex biological systems.
Researchers studied the role of the terminal gap gene huckebein (hkb) in the development of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. They used a systems-level approach to investigate how hkb affects the expression of other gap genes, which are crucial for specifying the position of body segments during embryonic development. The team created mathematical models, called gap gene circuits, to analyze the regulatory interactions between hkb and other gap genes. These models are computational tools that help extract regulatory information from spatial expression data.

The researchers found that hkb is involved in regulating the posterior hunchback (hb) domain, but it does not have any other essential function. They showed that hkb is required for the anterior shift in the posterior border of the hb domain, which is now correctly reproduced in their models. Additionally, their models are able to reproduce mutants of terminal gap genes, whereas previous models were unable to do so. This improvement allows the models to capture the expression dynamics of all posterior gap genes and some variational properties of the system correctly.

The study provides a better understanding of the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap gene network. The researchers used quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein and combined it with data from other gap genes to create more accurate models. They found that considering variability in the data and analyzing parameter determinability significantly improves the biological relevance and consistency of the approach.
Researchers have developed a novel immunotherapy for Brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide. Currently, there is no effective treatment or biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy, and infected animals remain carriers for life. The new approach uses phage lysates, which are derived from bacteria-killing viruses, of two live attenuated vaccine strains of Brucella abortus, S19 and RB51. These phage lysates retain the maximum immunogenicity of the bacteria and can stimulate both antibody and cell-mediated immunity. In a study, 21 naturally Brucellosis-affected adult cows were divided into four groups and treated with either S19 lysate, RB51 lysate, a combination of both, or a placebo. The results showed that a single subcutaneous dose of 2 ml of the phage lysate cocktail eliminated live virulent Brucella from the infected cattle within three months. The therapy was monitored non-invasively through a specific biomarker, Brucella-specific RNA in plasma, which was undetectable by RT-PCR and blood cultures were negative for live Brucella. This is the first report on the use of RB51 phage lysate for successful immunotherapy of Brucellosis in cattle. The study demonstrates the potential of phage lysates as a safe and effective treatment for Brucellosis, and the use of Brucella-specific RNA as a minimally invasive biomarker to monitor the efficacy of therapy.
Researchers used a technique called chemical genetics to study the role of a protein called Cdk2 in human cells. Cdk2 is a type of enzyme that helps control the cell cycle, which is the process by which cells grow and divide. The study found that Cdk2 plays a specific role in helping cells respond to DNA damage caused by radiation. When cells are exposed to radiation, their DNA is damaged, and the cell cycle is halted to allow for repair. Cdk2 helps orchestrate this response by phosphorylating, or adding a chemical tag to, a protein called Nbs1. Nbs1 is part of a complex that helps repair DNA damage and communicate with other parts of the cell.

The researchers used a mutant version of Cdk2 that is sensitive to a specific inhibitor, which allowed them to selectively turn off Cdk2 activity in cells. They found that when Cdk2 was inhibited, cells were more sensitive to radiation and had difficulty repairing DNA damage. This suggests that Cdk2 plays a non-redundant role in the DNA damage response, meaning that other proteins cannot compensate for its absence. The study also found that Cdk2 phosphorylates Nbs1 at a specific site, and that this phosphorylation is necessary for cells to respond to DNA damage.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of Cdk2 in the DNA damage response and identifies a specific target of Cdk2 within the DNA repair machinery. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells respond to DNA damage and how this process can be targeted for cancer therapy.
Researchers used a technique called formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to create maps of open chromatin in two types of blood cells: megakaryocytes and erythroblastoid cells. These cells are involved in the production of platelets, which play a crucial role in blood clotting. The researchers applied the FAIRE method to 62 genetic loci associated with various blood-related traits, such as platelet count, and cardiovascular diseases like coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. They found that the two cell types had distinct patterns of open chromatin, which are regions of the genome where genes are actively being expressed.

The researchers identified a specific region on chromosome 7q22.3 that was open in megakaryocytes but not erythroblastoid cells. Within this region, they found a common non-coding sequence variant, rs342293, which is associated with platelet volume and function. By resequencing this region in 643 individuals, they confirmed that rs342293 is the likely causative variant. The researchers also showed that the different versions of this variant (C and G alleles) affect the binding of a transcription factor called EVI1, which in turn regulates the expression of the PIK3CG gene in platelets and macrophages. The PIK3CG gene is involved in platelet membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation. This study provides a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding genetic variant influences platelet phenotype.
Researchers used computer simulations to study the effects of blocking a type of electrical current called the persistent sodium current (INaP) in the respiratory system. This current is thought to play a crucial role in rhythm generation in the pre-Bötzinger complex (pre-BötC), a group of neurons responsible for controlling breathing. Two commonly used blockers, tetrodotoxin (TTX) and riluzole (RZ), were used to block INaP, but they have different mechanisms of action. TTX directly blocks the sodium channel, while RZ shifts the inactivation of the channel in the hyperpolarizing direction.

The simulations showed that the effects of blocking INaP with TTX and RZ are not equivalent, and that RZ may not effectively block INaP in the intact respiratory network. This is because RZ's mechanism of action allows INaP to be reactivated by transient hyperpolarizing perturbations. In contrast, TTX completely blocks INaP and stops respiratory rhythm generation. The simulations also showed that pre-I bursting in the intact network is likely dependent on both inhibitory network interactions and INaP, and that experimental TTX application in the intact network is predicted to terminate respiratory rhythmicity.

The study provides a mechanistic explanation for seemingly contradictory experimental results from in vitro studies of INaP block and suggests that the effects of INaP block in in vitro preparations are not necessarily equivalent to those in more intact preparations. The results support a critical role for INaP in respiratory rhythmogenesis in vivo and highlight the importance of considering the mechanism of action when interpreting and simulating data relating to pharmacological blockade.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that contributes to the spread of gastric cancer, a type of cancer that affects the stomach. MicroRNAs, small molecules that regulate gene expression, play a key role in this process. Specifically, a microRNA called miR-218 is found to be decreased in gastric cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body. This decrease in miR-218 leads to an increase in the expression of a protein called Robo1, which in turn activates a signaling pathway that promotes cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

The study found that miR-218 directly targets Robo1, a receptor that interacts with another protein called Slit2. When miR-218 is present, it suppresses Robo1 expression, preventing the activation of the Slit-Robo1 pathway. However, when miR-218 levels are low, Robo1 is overexpressed, leading to the activation of this pathway and the promotion of cancer cell invasion and metastasis.

Restoring miR-218 expression in gastric cancer cells suppressed Robo1 expression and reduced tumor cell invasion and metastasis in both laboratory experiments and animal models. This suggests that targeting miR-218 may be a potential strategy for blocking the spread of gastric cancer. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of gastric cancer metastasis and highlights the importance of microRNAs in regulating gene expression in cancer cells.
Researchers have identified a network of genes that play a crucial role in preventing the formation of advanced atherosclerotic plaques when plasma cholesterol levels are lowered. Atherosclerosis is a condition in which fatty deposits build up in the arteries, leading to coronary artery disease and stroke. The study used a mouse model with human-like hypercholesterolemia to investigate the effects of plasma cholesterol-lowering on atherosclerosis development. The researchers found that atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then rapidly expanded and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of the lesions revealed that the accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to the rapid expansion phase with accelerated foam-cell formation and inflammation.

Genetic lowering of plasma cholesterol prevented the formation of advanced plaques, and transcriptional profiling identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation of these genes in macrophages incubated with acetylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation. This network of genes is of interest for the development of novel atherosclerosis therapies. The study also found that the cholesterol-lowering effect was mediated by 37 cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes, and that some of these genes, such as PVRL2 and HSDL2, should be considered for therapies to prevent the formation of advanced plaques. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis and identifies potential targets for the development of new treatments.
Researchers have developed a new screening method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. The cell envelope is a protective barrier that is difficult for antimicrobial drugs to penetrate, making it a challenging target for new treatments. The new screening method, called the CPRG screen, was used to study the bacterium Escherichia coli and identified 102 genes of unknown function that likely impact envelope biogenesis. One of these genes, ElyC (YcbC), was further characterized and found to play a critical role in the metabolism of a lipid carrier used for the biogenesis of cell wall and other bacterial surface polysaccharides. This lipid carrier, undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P), is essential for the synthesis of many extracellular polysaccharides. The discovery of ElyC as a new envelope biogenesis factor validates the utility of the CPRG screening approach. Further analysis of ElyC and other genes identified in the screen is expected to provide new insights into the biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and reveal potential vulnerabilities that could be targeted by new drugs. The CPRG screen is also adaptable to other organisms, allowing researchers to study the biogenesis of different envelope architectures and understand how bacteria adapt to different environments. This research has the potential to lead to the development of new treatments for Gram-negative bacterial infections, which are becoming increasingly resistant to existing antibiotics.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze complex biological data from multiple sources, such as gene expression, protein localization, and tissue morphogenesis. This method, called semi-supervised learning, combines data from different imaging techniques to create a single, integrated view of biological dynamics. The approach was tested using a dataset from studies of pattern formation in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. The result is a continuous trajectory that reveals the joint dynamics of multiple biological processes.

The researchers used a dataset of over 1,000 images, each showing the spatial position of cell nuclei and the distribution of various components of the developmental patterning network. They applied the semi-supervised learning approach to fuse the data from these images, resulting in a multivariable trajectory that shows the joint dynamics of tissue shape and five molecular components. This approach can be adapted to other imaging modalities and forms a starting point for further data analysis and modeling of biological dynamics.

The new method addresses a long-standing challenge in biology: synthesizing data from different observations into coherent multivariable trajectories. This is essential for understanding complex biological processes, such as developmental pattern formation, which involve multiple variables and interactions. The semi-supervised learning approach provides a systematic way to fuse heterogeneous datasets and can be applied to various fields, including physics and social sciences. The reconstructed trajectories can serve as a basis for more advanced mechanistic studies of multivariable processes responsible for the highly reproducible dynamics of developmental pattern formation.
Researchers studied three types of snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) to understand how they cause hemorrhage. These enzymes, known as PI, PII, and PIII, are found in the venom of certain snakes and can break down the extracellular matrix, a network of proteins that holds tissues together. The study found that PII and PIII SVMPs tend to localize in the microvasculature, specifically in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules, where they co-localize with type IV collagen, a key component of the extracellular matrix. In contrast, PI SVMP has a more widespread distribution in the tissue.

The researchers also compared the ability of these enzymes to break down different components of the extracellular matrix, such as laminin, type VI collagen, and nidogen. They found that while PII and PIII SVMPs showed similar patterns of degradation for type IV collagen, they differed in their ability to break down other components. Proteomic analysis of wound exudate revealed that PI SVMP caused more extensive proteolysis of several extracellular matrix components and fibrinogen, while PII and PIII SVMPs had higher amounts of intracellular proteins in the exudate.

These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which SVMPs cause damage to the microvasculature and lead to hemorrhage. The study suggests that the localization of PII and PIII SVMPs in the microvasculature and their ability to break down type IV collagen are key factors in their hemorrhagic activity.
A noncoding RNA called iab-8 plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of the homeotic gene abd-A in Drosophila melanogaster. Abd-A is responsible for the development of the eighth abdominal segment, and its expression is normally repressed by the Abdominal-B (Abd-B) gene. However, in the absence of Abd-B, abd-A is ectopically expressed in the epidermis of the eighth abdominal segment, but not in the central nervous system. A 92-kilobase noncoding RNA, iab-8, is responsible for repressing abd-A in the central nervous system. This RNA produces a microRNA that acts in trans to repress abd-A, as well as a second, redundant mechanism that acts in cis through transcriptional interference with the abd-A promoter. Transcriptional interference occurs when the iab-8 RNA interferes with an abd-A enhancer, which must lie downstream of the iab-4186 breakpoint. The major poly(A) site of the iab-8 RNA lies just 1.1 kilobases upstream of the abd-A initiation site, suggesting that the abd-A promoter is the most likely target of interference. The iab-8 RNA can only repress the copy of abd-A on the chromosome from which it is transcribed, as shown by the lack of misexpression in embryos with a deletion of the iab-8 RNA and a deletion that removes the entire bithorax complex.
Researchers have studied the patterns of focal seizures, which are episodes of abnormal brain activity originating from a specific area of the brain. They have identified two main types of onset patterns: low amplitude fast (LAF) and high amplitude slow (HAS) oscillations. To understand the underlying mechanisms of these patterns, scientists used a computational model of brain tissue and validated it with clinical recordings of focal seizures. The model reproduced the two onset patterns and showed that they arise from different mechanisms.

The LAF pattern is initiated by localized patches of activity that slowly spread to surrounding tissue, while the HAS pattern is a global transition to a seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by an increase in the excitability of surrounding tissue, which can support seizure activity when triggered. The model suggests that the excitability of surrounding tissue plays a crucial role in determining the seizure onset pattern and surgical outcomes.

The study found that the HAS pattern is associated with a rapid invasion of seizure activity into surrounding tissue, whereas the LAF pattern is characterized by a slower spread of activity. The model also showed that changes in tissue excitability could be used to explain the difference in surgical outcomes between the two patterns. Overall, the research provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying focal seizures and highlights the importance of surrounding tissue excitability in determining seizure onset patterns.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZmES4 that plays a crucial role in the fertilization process of maize plants. In flowering plants, sperm cells are non-motile and are transported to the female gametes via the pollen tube. When the pollen tube reaches the female gametophyte, two sperm cells are released into the receptive synergid cell to execute double fertilization. The researchers found that ZmES4 is a defensin-like protein that is exclusively expressed in the cells of the female gametophyte. It accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells and is released during fertilization. Using RNAi knock-down and synthetic ZmES4 proteins, the researchers found that ZmES4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner. They also discovered that ZmES4 interacts with a potassium channel called KZM1, causing it to open and allowing potassium ions to flow into the pollen tube. This influx of potassium ions leads to water uptake and ultimately causes the pollen tube to burst. The researchers suggest that this mechanism represents a pre-zygotic hybridization barrier and may be a component of reproductive isolation in plants. The study provides new insights into the molecular and physiological mechanisms involved in pollen tube growth arrest and burst, and highlights the importance of ZmES4 and KZM1 in the fertilization process.
Researchers have developed an oncolytic herpesvirus, R-LM249, that specifically targets and kills cancer cells expressing the HER-2 protein, which is overproduced in certain types of ovarian and breast cancers. This virus, retargeted to HER-2, was tested in mouse models that mimic the spread of cancer to the peritoneal cavity, a common outcome in advanced ovarian and breast cancer patients. The results show that intraperitoneal administration of R-LM249 significantly inhibited the growth of ovarian and breast cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity, with 60% of mice showing no signs of cancer spread and a 95% reduction in tumor weight. The virus also reduced the growth of ovarian and breast cancer metastases in the brain. Notably, R-LM249 was effective against cancer cells that are resistant to the commonly used cancer treatment trastuzumab. The study demonstrates the potential of R-LM249 as a preclinical therapy for disseminated HER-2+ ovarian and breast carcinomas.
Scientists have discovered a crucial mechanism that regulates the duplication of centrosomes, the structures that form the poles of the mitotic spindle in eukaryotic cells. Centrosome duplication must occur only once per cell cycle to ensure proper bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance. Researchers found that a protein called Sfi1, a component of centrosomes, is the first target of a key enzyme called cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) that restricts centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. When Cdk1 phosphorylates Sfi1, it promotes the separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies (SPBs, the yeast equivalent of centrosomes) and prevents premature reduplication of SPBs during mitosis. Conversely, the protein phosphatase Cdc14 dephosphorylates Sfi1, allowing SPBs to become licensed for duplication at the end of mitosis. The study found that mutations that prevent Cdk1 from phosphorylating Sfi1 lead to defects in SPB separation, bipolar spindle assembly, and chromosome segregation. These findings suggest that phosphoregulation of Sfi1 by Cdk1 has a dual function: promoting SPB separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SPB duplication. This mechanism is essential for maintaining genome stability and preventing chromosomal instability, which is commonly observed in cancers. The study provides new insights into the regulation of centrosome duplication and highlights the importance of Sfi1 as a key player in this process.
Researchers have investigated the role of viral protein R (Vpr) in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS. Vpr is a protein encoded by HIV-1 that has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in infected cells in laboratory experiments. However, its role in HIV-1 infection in living organisms has not been fully understood. To study Vpr's role in HIV-1 infection, researchers used a humanized mouse model, where human immune cells are transplanted into mice. The study found that Vpr causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CD4+ T cells, including regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are a type of immune cell that helps to regulate the immune response. This leads to a depletion of Tregs and an increase in virus production during the early stages of HIV-1 infection. The study also found that Vpr enhances virus replication and Treg depletion in mice infected with HIV-1 that uses the CCR5 receptor to enter cells, but not in mice infected with HIV-1 that uses the CXCR4 receptor. This suggests that Vpr takes advantage of proliferating CD4+ T cells, particularly Tregs, to enhance the replication of CCR5-tropic HIV-1. The study's findings provide new insights into the role of Vpr in HIV-1 infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS.
Researchers analyzed the genetic makeup of Plasmodium vivax, the parasite responsible for vivax malaria, in South Korea from 1994 to 2008. They used microsatellite DNA markers to study the population structure and transmission dynamics of the parasite. The study found a drastic genetic change in the parasite population in South Korea during 2002 and 2003. This change was not due to relapse or asymptomatic parasite carriage, but rather the introduction of new parasite strains from other sources. One possible source of these new strains is North Korea. The study suggests that the parasite population in South Korea has been influenced by the introduction of new strains, which has led to changes in the genetic makeup of the population. The researchers used a more detailed and precise approach than in their previous study, analyzing 14 microsatellite DNA loci from 163 isolates, compared to 10 loci from 87 isolates in the previous study. The study highlights the importance of molecular epidemiology in understanding the population structure and transmission dynamics of the parasite, which can aid in the elimination of vivax malaria in endemic areas.
Researchers have long known that introns, non-coding regions within genes, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. A new study has shed light on how introns influence the direction of transcription, the process by which genetic information is copied from DNA to RNA. The study found that the presence of a splicing-competent intron is essential for determining the direction of transcription, with the intron acting as a regulator of promoter directionality.

The researchers used a technique called strand-specific transcription run-on analysis to show that the presence of an intron favors the transcription of messenger RNA (mRNA) over upstream anti-sense transcripts. They also found that mutations in the 5' or 3' splice sites of the intron reversed this effect, suggesting that the entire intron, not just the 5' splice site, is responsible for regulating transcription directionality.

Further analysis revealed that the intron-dependent gene looping, a process in which the intron facilitates the looping of the gene, is crucial for the recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region. These termination factors are necessary for stopping upstream anti-sense transcription and providing directionality to the promoter-initiated transcription. The study suggests that the intron-dependent gene looping places the terminator-bound factors in the vicinity of the promoter region, allowing for the termination of upstream anti-sense transcription and the promotion of mRNA transcription. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of introns in regulating gene expression and the importance of gene looping in determining transcription directionality.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor called ZBED6, which plays a crucial role in regulating muscle growth and development in placental mammals. ZBED6 is derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, a type of genetic element that can jump from one location to another in the genome. The researchers found that ZBED6 binds to the IGF2 gene, which is involved in muscle growth, and represses its expression. A mutation in the IGF2 gene in pigs leads to a 3-fold increase in IGF2 expression, resulting in increased muscle growth, larger heart size, and altered fat deposition.

In a study using mouse C2C12 myoblasts, the researchers found that silencing ZBED6 led to increased IGF2 expression, cell proliferation, and faster wound healing. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing revealed over 2,500 ZBED6 binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif that matches the established binding site in IGF2. The researchers also found that genes associated with ZBED6 binding sites were enriched for certain biological processes, including development and transcriptional regulation.

The study suggests that ZBED6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation, and growth. The researchers propose that ZBED6 may mediate transcriptional silencing by moving the IGF2 locus and other targets to the nucleolus. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of ZBED6 in regulating gene expression and its potential implications for human health and disease.
Researchers have mapped the RNA editome of rhesus macaques, a close relative of humans, using next-generation sequencing technology. They identified 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions, and verified 96.6% of these sites in coding regions and 97.5% in non-coding regions. The study found that adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome, with A-to-G editing sites flanked by sequences with attributes of ADAR substrates. The researchers also found that the sequence context and expression profile of ADARs influence the quantitative variance of RNA editing across different sites and tissue types.

The study suggests that RNA editing is a widespread functional regulation in primate evolution, shaped by purifying selection. The researchers detected substitution valleys of decreased divergence around editing sites, indicating evolutionary constraint in maintaining some editing substrates with their double-stranded structure. This finding supports the "continuous probing" model, which proposes that a small proportion of functional editing sites originate through tinkering.

The study provides a representative account of RNA-editing sites across the rhesus macaque genome, allowing for further interrogation of the global attributes of the RNA editome. The researchers found intra-population conservation of the macaque editome, as well as parallels with the editome across multiple primate species. The study highlights the importance of RNA editing in primate evolution and provides an informative framework for understanding RNA editing in humans.
Researchers have discovered a new perceptual bias that affects how people perceive visual stimuli. In a two-alternative visual discrimination task, participants were asked to identify the spatial frequency of a grating pattern. The study found that the presence of filtered noise significantly altered the perceived spatial frequency of the grating, shifting it to lower or higher frequencies depending on the type of noise. This bias occurs because observers consider the likelihood of spatial frequencies that are unlikely to occur during the task, which lowers the detectability of the grating and leads to an incorrect perception of its spatial frequency.

The study used spectrally filtered noise to induce an asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequency, which mainly affects the likelihood of irrelevant frequencies. Despite high overall performance and steep psychometric functions in the discrimination task, participants' decisions were influenced by the likelihood of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies, rather than the veridical grating spatial frequency. The results suggest that observers discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives when performing two-alternative discrimination.

The study's findings differ from traditional psychophysical models of early visual encoding of gratings embedded in external noise, which assume that external noise only affects the variability of sensory responses without changing the average response. The researchers measured grating detectability and discriminability in the presence of filtered visual noise and found that it dramatically alters the perception of grating spatial frequency, with low-pass filtered noise decreasing perceived spatial frequency and high-pass filtered noise increasing it.
Researchers have made a significant discovery about piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), which play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNAs are derived from a long, polycistronic RNA precursor, but each piRNA represents a tiny, autonomous transcriptional unit. The researchers found that a specific 21-nucleotide sequence and a 50-nucleotide upstream motif are necessary for the expression of a germline-enriched, Piwi-dependent piRNA. This upstream motif acts as an independent promoter, specifying which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in which germline they are expressed. The study reveals that over 70% of C. elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germline, and the genes they target suggest that these two populations have evolved independently. The researchers also found that a single nucleotide position within the upstream motif directs differential germline enrichment. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the clustered organization of endogenous piRNA loci is not necessary for robust piRNA expression, and that each 21U RNA locus encodes all the information necessary for driving independent, autonomous transcription from over 15,000 unique piRNA loci in C. elegans. This study provides new insights into the regulation of piRNA expression and how specific sequences are designated as piRNAs.
Researchers have discovered a new host factor, Yip1A, that plays a crucial role in the activation of the IRE1 pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) during Brucella infection. Brucella species, such as B. abortus, replicate within host cells by sequestering themselves in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles, but the mechanisms behind this process were not well understood. The study found that during Brucella infection, the IRE1 pathway, but not the PERK and ATF6 pathways, of the UPR is activated, leading to the upregulation of COPII vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24D. These molecules are involved in the formation of COPII vesicles at ER exit sites (ERES), which are essential for the biogenesis of ER-derived vacuoles.

The researchers identified Yip1A as a novel host factor responsible for the activation of the IRE1 pathway in response to Brucella infection. Yip1A mediates the phosphorylation of IRE1 through high-order assembly of Ire1 molecules at ERES under UPR conditions. Without Yip1A, Brucella fails to generate ER-derived vacuoles and remains in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The study also found that autophagy-related proteins Atg9 and WIPI1, but not DFCP1, are required for the biogenesis of ER-derived membrane compartments. The researchers propose a model for intracellular Brucella replication that exploits the host UPR and ER-derived vacuole formation machineries, both of which depend on Yip1A-mediated IRE1 activation.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) hijack the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to support their replication. Vps34 is recruited into the large viral replication compartment, where it produces PI(3)P phosphoinositide. The kinase function of Vps34 is essential for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI(3)P plays a crucial role in building the replication compartment. Overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase inhibits TBSV replication on peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on mitochondrial membranes. The purified PI(3)P phosphatase also reduces TBSV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI(3)P reveals its enrichment in the replication compartment. Vps34 is directly recruited into the replication compartment through interaction with the p33 replication protein. Gene deletion analysis in yeast shows that TBSV replication requires the vesicle transport function of Vps34. In the absence of Vps34, TBSV cannot efficiently recruit early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment. Vps34 and PI(3)P are necessary for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI(3)P abundance is decreased.
Researchers conducted a study in Iquitos, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on dengue virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies. The study aimed to compare artificial and natural blood feeding methods to determine the rate of dengue virus (DENV) infection and dissemination within mosquitoes. Participants, aged 5 years and older, were enrolled from ongoing studies on dengue in Iquitos, and their blood was used to feed wild-type Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. The mosquitoes were tested for DENV infection and dissemination after approximately 14 days of extrinsic incubation.

The study found that DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different between direct and indirect-EDTA feeding methods, but were significantly lower for mosquitoes that fed indirectly on untreated blood. Infection rates showed greater variation following indirect-EDTA than indirect-no additive feeding. Dissemination rates were similar across all feeding methods. The study also found no differences in DENV infection or dissemination rates in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different dengue illness severity.

The study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence. Direct mosquito feeding is preferable due to its logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability. The study provides preliminary data on the ability of DENV from people with mild or inapparent disease to infect and disseminate within mosquitoes.
Researchers investigated why some people respond differently to chemotherapy drugs that target topoisomerase II, an enzyme involved in DNA replication. They used the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study the genetic basis of this variability. The team found that natural variation in a single amino acid substitution in the topoisomerase II enzyme, specifically a methionine-to-glutamine substitution, underlies differences in sensitivity to topoisomerase II poisons. This substitution affects the interaction between the enzyme and the poison etoposide, leading to increased genomic instability in worms with the methionine residue.

The researchers also found that this amino acid difference is conserved from yeast to humans and is one of the few differences between the two human topoisomerase II isoforms, hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ. They used genome-edited human cell lines to show that this residue in hTOPIIα contributes to differential toxicity of various topoisomerase II poisons. Specifically, cells containing the glutamine-edited hTOPOIIα allele were less affected by certain poisons, such as teniposide and XK469. These results demonstrate the utility of using C. elegans to understand the genetics of drug responses and highlight the potential for personalized treatments based on genetic information. The findings also explain why hTOPIIα and hTOPIIβ are differentially affected by various poisons.
Researchers studied the genetics of lifespan in long-lived rodents, specifically African mole-rats, to gain insights into the mechanisms that determine mammalian lifespans. They analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and identified 250 genes associated with enhanced longevity. These genes, known as positively selected genes (PSGs), showed an expression pattern in the liver of long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats that fits the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging. This theory suggests that genes with beneficial effects in youth have negative effects in old age.

The PSGs were found to be enriched for genes related to aging, including cellular respiration, metal ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, the PSGs included RHEB and IGF1, central components of aging-relevant pathways, as well as genes previously unknown to be associated with aging, such as RHEBL1, AMHR2, PSMG1, and AGER. Protein homology modeling suggested functional consequences for amino acid changes under positive selection.

The researchers also found that lower expression of genes related to these processes, as well as pharmacological inhibition of the respective gene products, was associated with longer lifespan in other organisms, including worms, killifishes, and mice. This suggests that the identified PSGs are associated with expression changes during aging in long- and short-lived rodents, consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging.
Researchers have developed a new approach to control the spread of Aedes albopictus-borne viruses, such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, by introducing a specific type of bacteria called Wolbachia into the mosquito population. The bacteria, wMel, was introduced into a previously established Aedes albopictus line, ARwP, to create a new strain, ARwP-M. This new strain showed a 100% rate of maternal inheritance of the wMel and wPip Wolbachia, and its survival, fecundity, and egg fertility were similar to those of the original ARwP line.

The researchers found that the ARwP-M males were fully sterile when mated with wild-type females, while the egg hatch rate increased with the age of the wild-type males. When competing with wild-type males for wild-type females, the ARwP-M males induced a higher level of sterility. The overall Wolbachia density in ARwP-M females was 15 times higher than in ARwP females, mainly due to the wMel infection. This led to a significant reduction in the vector competence of ARwP-M females for chikungunya and dengue viruses, with transmission rates of 5% and 0% at 14 and 21 days post-infection, respectively. However, the results regarding Zika virus transmission did not show significant differences between ARwP-M and ARwP females, with none of the tested ARwP-M females capable of transmitting the virus. These findings suggest that the exploitation of Wolbachia could be a promising strategy to suppress wild-type Aedes albopictus populations.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify peptide-mediated interactions between proteins, which are crucial for various biological processes. These interactions occur when a protein's globular domain recognizes a linear peptide from another protein, creating a small contact interface. Current methods for discovering these interactions rely on the tendency of peptides to occur in disordered regions of proteins. However, this study focuses on the observation that peptides adopt a well-defined structure when binding to their partner domain. By analyzing high-resolution 3D structures of protein interactions, the researchers found that the structure of the peptide can be just as characteristic as its consensus motif, allowing for the identification of target peptides even if they don't match established patterns. The team developed a strategy using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to search for unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions in protein complexes with known 3D structures. They also derived consensus patterns for these interactions and compared them with established linear motif patterns and their binding domains. To validate their approach, the researchers scanned interactome networks from four model organisms and found significant over-representations of 64 domain-motif interactions, 46 of which were previously unknown, involving over 6,000 interactions.
Researchers studied 49 adults in Zambia with environmental enteropathy, a condition linked to growth failure, malabsorption, and poor vaccine responses. They used various techniques, including confocal laser endomicroscopy, histology, and mRNA sequencing, to examine the small intestines of these individuals. The study found widespread damage to the small intestine, with defects in the epithelial lining, particularly at the tips of villi. These defects allowed bacteria to leak into the bloodstream, which was associated with increased levels of lipopolysaccharide, a component of bacterial cell walls.

The researchers also found that the ability to absorb zinc was impaired in 64% of participants, and that this impairment was linked to HIV infection and lower levels of a protective peptide called glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Transcriptomic analysis identified 23 genes that were differently expressed in individuals with severe enteropathy, including those involved in mucosal protection. The study suggests that GLP-2 and other protective peptides may play a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal lining in individuals with environmental enteropathy.

The researchers used confocal endomicroscopy to visualize the small intestine in real-time and found that epithelial breaches were associated with high levels of lipopolysaccharide in the bloodstream. They also found that the surface area of the villi was inversely related to lipopolysaccharide levels, suggesting that increased surface area may increase the risk of bacterial translocation. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying environmental enteropathy and highlights the importance of GLP-2 and other protective peptides in maintaining intestinal health.
Scientists have long observed that some viruses can prevent themselves from infecting the same host cells again, a phenomenon known as superinfection exclusion (SIE). Researchers have now identified the protein responsible for SIE in turnip crinkle virus (TCV), a plant virus. The protein, called p28, is one of the two replication proteins encoded by TCV. When p28 is expressed from a TCV replicon, it blocks the replication of a different TCV replicon. This repressive activity is enhanced when p28 is modified with tags or fluorescent proteins, but weakened when modified at its N-terminus. The researchers found that p28 forms large, mobile inclusions in cells that trans-aggregate a non-repressive, yet replication-competent, p28 mutant. This suggests that p28 forms multimeric complexes that intercept fresh p28 monomers translated from superinfector genomes, preventing superinfector replication. This mechanism could be applicable to other RNA viruses and offers a potential target for antiviral therapy. The study reveals that p28 acts both as a replication facilitator and a repressor, depending on its concentration, and that its repressive activity involves post-translational interactions with other p28 molecules. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of SIE and could lead to the development of novel antiviral strategies.
Researchers have developed a genetic vaccine to protect against Trypanosoma cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease. The vaccine uses a plasmid DNA encoding the parasite's trans-sialidase (TS) gene, which triggers a strong immune response in mice. However, the protection provided by this vaccine wanes over time. To improve long-term protection, scientists co-administered a plasmid encoding interleukin-15 (IL-15) with the TS vaccine. IL-15 is a protein that helps T cells, a type of immune cell, to survive and multiply. The study found that mice vaccinated with both the TS and IL-15 plasmids were significantly more protected against a lethal T. cruzi challenge six months after vaccination compared to those vaccinated with the TS plasmid alone. This improved protection was associated with higher numbers of TS-specific T cells that could expand and produce the protein interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) after re-stimulation. The addition of IL-15 to the vaccine also improved the survival and expansion of these T cells. The results suggest that co-administering IL-15 with the TS vaccine can enhance long-term protection against T. cruzi infection, which is a significant step towards developing an effective vaccine against Chagas disease.
Researchers have identified a protein complex called CRL4WDR1 that plays a crucial role in controlling the abundance of a protein called TbPLK in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. TbPLK is essential for processes such as basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. The CRL4WDR1 complex consists of four proteins: Cullin4, DNA damage-binding protein 1 homolog TbDDB1, and a WD40-repeat protein called WDR1. WDR1 acts as a receptor for TbPLK in the CRL4 ubiquitin ligase complex, targeting it for degradation. When WDR1 is depleted, TbPLK accumulates excessively in the basal body and bilobe, leading to defects in bilobe duplication, basal body segregation, and flagellum attachment. The researchers found that WDR1 localizes to the basal body and bilobe region during the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that CRL4WDR1 is primarily responsible for TbPLK degradation in these regions. The study highlights the importance of the CRL4WDR1 complex in regulating TbPLK levels and maintaining proper cell division in Trypanosoma brucei.
Researchers have found that the RNA helicase DDX3X plays a crucial role in the body's innate immune system, which is the first line of defense against infections. The study, conducted on mice, showed that mice lacking DDX3X in their hematopoietic system (the system that produces blood cells) were highly susceptible to infection with the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. This suggests that DDX3X is essential for the body's ability to fight off certain types of infections.

The researchers also found that DDX3X is involved in the regulation of the immune response, particularly in the production of cytokines, which are signaling molecules that help to coordinate the immune response. The study showed that mice lacking DDX3X had impaired cytokine production, which made them more susceptible to infection.

Interestingly, the researchers found that the effects of DDX3X deficiency were sex-specific, meaning that the impact of DDX3X loss was different in male and female mice. This suggests that DDX3X may contribute to sex-related differences in resistance to microbes and resilience to inflammatory disease.

The study also found that DDX3X is involved in the regulation of gene expression in macrophages, a type of immune cell that plays a key role in the innate immune response. The researchers used RNA sequencing to analyze the gene expression profiles of macrophages from mice lacking DDX3X and found that the loss of DDX3X altered the expression of genes involved in the innate immune response.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of DDX3X in the innate immune system and suggests that it may be a key player in the body's ability to fight off certain types of infections.
A computational model of the insect pheromone transduction cascade in male moth olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) has been developed. The model focuses on the post-effector processes, including the production and degradation of second messengers, the opening and closing of ionic channels, and Ca2+ extrusion mechanisms. The model takes into account the translocation of pheromone molecules from the air to the sensillum lymph, their deactivation and interaction with receptors, and the activation of G-protein and effector enzymes.

The model was fitted to experimental data on the amplitude and temporal characteristics of the receptor potential in response to single pulse stimulation of various intensities. The results show that the model captures the main features of the dose-response curves, including a wide dynamic range of six decades, short rising time, and long falling time. The model also reproduces the second messenger kinetics.

The model suggests that the two main types of depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pheromone concentrations. The DAG-gated cationic channel plays a major role in depolarization at low concentrations, while the Ca2+-gated Cl- channel plays a major role at middle and high concentrations. The model provides several testable predictions and highlights the importance of understanding the post-effector processes in insect pheromone transduction.
Researchers studied how the tumor suppressor protein p53 responds to cellular stress by binding to specific DNA sequences called p53 response elements (p53REs) and activating gene expression. They mapped p53 binding sites and gene expression changes in human cells treated with a DNA-damaging agent called doxorubicin. The study found that p53 binding and gene expression were influenced by the local chromatin context, including histone modifications and chromatin accessibility. Most highly inducible p53-regulated genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTCF binding.

The researchers discovered that p53RE sequences in different chromatin contexts had distinct properties. Weaker p53REs were found in open promoters, while stronger p53REs were located in enhancers and repressed chromatin. p53 occupancy was strongly correlated with the similarity of the target DNA sequences to the p53RE consensus, but inversely correlated with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility and evolutionary conservation at the p53RE.

The study also found that p53 binding to transposable element (TE) repeats was significantly higher and correlated with stronger p53RE sequences. However, binding at these elements was not typically associated with transactivation of adjacent genes. The results suggest that the interaction between chromatin status and p53RE context plays a crucial role in the induced transactivation response, and that this response has been shaped by evolutionary selective pressure, likely driven by transposable elements. The study highlights the importance of considering the interactions of sequence content and epigenetic factors in interpreting p53-mediated stress responses.
Researchers have reengineered a key component of bacterial signaling systems, known as two-component signaling systems, to create a tunable threshold device. These systems are crucial for bacteria to respond to their environment and are composed of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) protein. In this study, the researchers focused on a specific motif where a single HK can reversibly phosphorylate two separate RRs. They found that this motif allows for rapid signal termination and implements a sigmoidal signal-response relationship, meaning that the system responds to a signal in a switch-like manner.

The researchers identified two mathematical conditions necessary for this sigmoidal response and defined key parameters that control the threshold levels and sensitivity of the signal-response curve. They confirmed their findings experimentally by reconstituting the one HK-two RR motif in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway and measuring the resulting signal-response curve. The level of sigmoidality in the system can be controlled by the presence of the sink RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to the HK.

This discovery has implications for understanding bacterial physiology and designing synthetic signaling circuits. The one HK-two RR motif allows bacteria and yeast to implement tunable switch-like signal processing, making it an ideal basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications. The findings also open up new avenues for reengineering two-component signaling systems, which are used by most bacteria, certain eukaryotic microbes, and plants for signal transduction.
Researchers used a technique called single-cell RNA sequencing to study how individual yeast cells respond to stress. They found that cells within the same population can have different levels of stress tolerance, and that this variation is not just due to external factors, but also to differences within the cells themselves. The study focused on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a type of yeast commonly used in scientific research.

The researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the genetic activity of individual yeast cells before and after being exposed to salt stress. They found that there is significant regulatory variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. They also discovered that a subset of cells can decouple the expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental stress response. This decoupling is partly related to the cell cycle, but not to the yeast's ultradian metabolic cycle.

The study used live-cell imaging to observe the movement of transcription factors, which are proteins that help control gene expression, within the cells. The results suggest that cells have a mechanism to prevent uncoordinated bursts of transcription factor activation, but can still mount a stress response when the activation is coordinated. The study's findings provide new insights into the heterogeneity of the yeast stress response and highlight the importance of understanding the regulatory networks that control gene expression and stress tolerance.
Researchers have found that the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis, accumulates in large numbers in the male reproductive organs of mice. Specifically, the parasite is found in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis, but not in the lumen of the epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules of the testis. The presence of the parasite triggers a strong immune response, leading to inflammation, parasite degeneration, and tissue damage in the epididymal ducts.

The study used fine needle aspiration cytology to detect the parasite in the male reproductive system and histopathological analysis to examine the tissue damage. The results show that the parasite is not protected from the immune system in the male reproductive organs, but rather is exposed to a strong immune response. This is in contrast to previous studies that suggested the parasite may be protected from the immune system in these organs.

The researchers also found that the parasite accumulates in the epididymal adipose tissue, which is a major reservoir of the parasite. The study suggests that the male reproductive system is an important site for the accumulation of Trypanosoma brucei, and that fine needle aspiration cytology could be a useful diagnostic tool for detecting the parasite in animals infected with African trypanosomiasis. Overall, the study provides new insights into the behavior of the parasite in the male reproductive organs and its interaction with the immune system.
Researchers studied how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) respond to their environment through their sense of smell and taste. They found that the genes responsible for these senses, called chemoreceptors, are highly adaptable and change their expression in response to different conditions. This adaptability is crucial for the flies' survival, as it allows them to detect and respond to changes in their environment.

The study showed that chemoreceptor genes are independently regulated in males and females, at different stages of development, and under different physiological and social conditions. For example, the expression of certain chemoreceptor genes changes when flies are exposed to the odor of the opposite sex, while others change when they have physical contact with members of the same or opposite sex.

The researchers used a technique called cDNA microarrays to analyze the expression of chemoreceptor genes under various conditions. They found that the genes can be grouped into small, biologically relevant modules that are highly correlated with each other. This modular organization allows for fine-tuning of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to different environmental and physiological conditions.

The study provides a systematic description of the plasticity of the chemosensory system in Drosophila melanogaster. It shows that the expression of chemoreceptor genes is highly sensitive to changes in the environment and that the fly's sense of smell and taste is highly adaptable. This adaptability is essential for the fly's survival and may have implications for our understanding of how other organisms respond to their environment.
Researchers have found a link between abnormal meiotic recombination in human oocytes and the occurrence of trisomies. Trisomies are conditions where a person has an extra copy of a chromosome, often resulting from errors during meiosis, the process by which egg and sperm cells are formed. Studies have shown that disturbances in meiotic recombination are associated with various human trisomies of maternal origin. To investigate this further, scientists analyzed the distribution of MLH1, a protein involved in meiotic recombination, in human fetal oocytes. They found that the number of MLH1 foci was lower than expected, but its localization pattern was consistent with a crossover-associated protein. The researchers also identified "vulnerable" crossover configurations in individual chromosomes, which are thought to contribute to nondisjunctional events in the adult oocyte. These findings suggest that direct analysis of crossover events in human fetal oocytes can reveal specific patterns of recombination that are associated with trisomies. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying meiotic errors and may lead to a better understanding of the causes of trisomies. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore their implications for reproductive health.
Researchers have found that pre-exposure to the saliva of blood-feeding arthropods, such as mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks, can alter the progression of diseases transmitted by these insects. When an arthropod bites a mammal, it injects saliva containing compounds that trigger an immune response. This pre-sensitization of the host's immune system can either exacerbate or limit the symptoms of the disease, depending on the specific disease and the host's immune response.

A mathematical model developed by the researchers suggests that pre-sensitization can have both positive and negative consequences for public health. If the pre-sensitization leads to a rapid clearance of the infection, increasing the mortality rate of the arthropods may lead to greater disease control than expected. However, if the pre-sensitization prolongs the duration of the infection, increasing the mortality rate of the arthropods may actually increase the number of infected hosts.

The researchers found that the effect of pre-sensitization on acute symptoms is well-studied for leishmaniasis, but the immunological and clinical consequences are not well understood for other vector-parasite-host combinations. The study highlights the need to quantify how pre-sensitization modulates recovery and transmission rates in vector-borne diseases. The findings suggest that integrated vector management strategies may be necessary to mitigate the negative consequences of pre-sensitization.
Researchers studied how the immune system of mice affects the parasite Leishmania amazonensis, which causes a disease that affects 12 million people worldwide. They compared the proteins produced by the parasite in two types of mice: those with a normal immune system (BALB/c mice) and those with a weakened immune system (BALB/c nude mice). The study found that the parasite's proteins were different in the two types of mice, suggesting that the immune system plays a role in regulating the parasite's virulence.

The researchers identified 44 proteins that were produced in different amounts in the two types of mice. Some of these proteins are known to be involved in the parasite's virulence, such as oligopeptidase B and tryparedoxin peroxidase. In the mice with a weakened immune system, these proteins were produced in higher amounts, suggesting that the immune system helps to regulate their production. On the other hand, a protein called HSP70 was produced in higher amounts in the mice with a normal immune system.

This study provides new insights into how the immune system affects the parasite's virulence and may help identify potential targets for new treatments. The researchers believe that their findings could lead to a better understanding of the disease and the development of new therapies. The study also highlights the importance of the immune system in regulating the parasite's proteins and suggests that the parasite's virulence is influenced by the host's immune response.
Researchers have discovered that the enzyme AID, responsible for initiating immunoglobulin gene diversification, is regulated by the cell cycle. AID deaminates cytosines in DNA, which can lead to genomic instability and translocations in B cell malignancies. The study found that AID is degraded more slowly in the G1 phase of the cell cycle than in the S or G2-M phases. Mutations that affect AID's regulatory phosphorylation or catalytic activity can alter its stability and abundance.

The researchers tested the role of cell cycle regulation by fusing AID to tags that destabilize the protein outside of the G1 or S-G2/M phases. They found that enforced nuclear localization of AID in the G1 phase accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, while compromising viability in S-G2/M phase cells. This suggests that cell cycle regulation determines the ability of cells to respond to AID-initiated DNA damage.

The study also identified AID derivatives that accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, which could be useful tools for engineering genes and proteins through iterative mutagenesis and selection. The findings suggest that using cell cycle tags to regulate nuclear stability may be applicable to studying DNA repair and engineering the genome. Overall, this research provides new insights into the regulation of AID and its role in the cell cycle, which could have implications for understanding and treating B cell malignancies.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how microbes break down plant biomass, which is essential for understanding environmental carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes. They applied this method to the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans, which can ferment various plant polysaccharides, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabinans. The study found that the bacterium ferments these polysaccharides with varying efficiencies and prioritizes the metabolism of preferred substrates.

The researchers used a combination of techniques, including carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZyme) assays, RNA sequencing, and anaerobic growth screening, to understand how the bacterium responds to different polysaccharides. They discovered that the bacterium up-regulates specific groups of CAZymes, transporters, and enzymes to metabolize the constituent sugars. Fifty-six up-regulated CAZymes were purified and their activities showed that most polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family, but with different rates, specificities, and cellular localizations.

The researchers then tested the CAZymes in combination to identify synergies between enzymes acting on the same substrate with different catalytic mechanisms. This study advances our understanding of how microbes degrade and metabolize plant biomass, which is crucial for developing improved enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial processing of plant biomass. The findings also have implications for understanding the function of plant-degrading microbial communities in the environment and the human gut microbiome.
Researchers in Sierra Leone conducted a study to assess the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) on lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas previously treated for onchocerciasis. Between 2008 and 2010, three rounds of MDA were conducted in 12 districts where both LF and onchocerciasis were present. The study found that the prevalence of LF microfilariae (mf) decreased by 88.5% overall, from 2.6% to 0.3%. In four districts, the prevalence dropped to 0%, and in seven districts, it decreased by 70-95%. Only one district, Bombali, still had an mf prevalence of 1.58%. The average mf density among infected individuals decreased by 65.4%, and the overall mf density in the population decreased by 96.2%. The study suggests that three rounds of MDA were effective in reducing LF prevalence and density in the study areas. The results indicate that the integrated approach of managing both onchocerciasis and LF has been successful in controlling LF in Sierra Leone. The study's findings support the use of MDA as a strategy for LF elimination.
Researchers have found that analyzing data from high-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, can produce unreliable results due to the nature of the data. This type of data, known as compositional data, consists of relative fractions of genes or species rather than their absolute abundances. A team of scientists used simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project to demonstrate that compositional effects can be widespread and severe, leading to many artifactual correlations among taxa. In some cases, true correlations may even appear with opposite signs. The researchers found that community diversity is a key factor that modulates the severity of these compositional effects.

To address this issue, the team developed a new approach called SparCC, which can estimate correlation values from compositional data. They applied SparCC to infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. The results showed that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data. Most of the erroneous links were found in the samples with the lowest diversity. The study highlights the importance of developing appropriate analysis methods for compositional data, which is crucial for understanding the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae resists the antimicrobial effects of lysozyme, an enzyme found on mucosal surfaces. Lysozyme breaks down the peptidoglycan layer of bacterial cell walls, which is essential for bacterial survival. Two enzymes, PgdA and Adr, modify the peptidoglycan layer of S. pneumoniae, making it resistant to lysozyme. The study found that the muramidase activity of lysozyme, which breaks down peptidoglycan, is responsible for its antimicrobial effect. Both PgdA and Adr modifications are necessary for S. pneumoniae to be fully resistant to lysozyme.

The researchers tested the importance of lysozyme and peptidoglycan modifications during colonization of the upper respiratory tract in mice. They found that wild-type S. pneumoniae outcompeted a mutant strain lacking both PgdA and Adr in mice with normal lysozyme levels, but not in mice with low lysozyme levels. This suggests that resistance to lysozyme's muramidase activity is crucial for S. pneumoniae to colonize mucosal surfaces. In contrast, single mutations in either PgdA or Adr provided a competitive advantage over the wild-type strain in both mice with normal and low lysozyme levels. This indicates that individual peptidoglycan modifications reduce bacterial fitness, but the benefits of resistance to lysozyme outweigh this cost. The study highlights the complex effects of peptidoglycan modifications on bacterial growth and survival in different environments.
A new approach to diagnosing dengue fatal cases has been developed using NS1 antigen capture tests in tissue specimens. Dengue is the most significant arthropod-borne viral disease in terms of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with Brazil accounting for approximately 80% of cases in the Americas. The study aimed to investigate the usefulness of NS1 capture tests as an alternative tool to detect dengue virus (DENV) in tissue specimens from 23 previously confirmed dengue fatal cases that occurred in Brazil in 2002. A total of 74 tissue specimens were analyzed, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes.

The study evaluated three tests for NS1 antigen capture: Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and the rapid test NS1 Ag Strip. The results showed that the NS1 Ag Strip was the most sensitive, detecting DENV in 78.3% of specimens, followed by Platelia NS1 at 60.8%, and Dengue Early ELISA at 34.7%. The NS1 Ag Strip was also the most sensitive in various tissues, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus. The study demonstrates that DENV NS1 capture assays are a valuable approach to postmortem dengue confirmation and may be used as a clinical/pathological diagnostic tool. This is the first study to evaluate ELISA and ICT for detecting DENV antigens in tissues, providing a new approach for diagnosing dengue fatal cases.
A recent study analyzed the genetic profiles of 718 multiple myeloma patients from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's CoMMpass study. The researchers found significant differences in the frequency of genetic mutations between patients of African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) descent. The study used somatic whole exome and RNA sequencing to compare the genetic profiles of AA and CA patients. The results showed that certain genes, such as BCL7A, BRWD3, and AUTS2, were more frequently mutated in AA patients, while TP53 and IRF4 were more frequently mutated in CA patients. These genes are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of multiple myeloma, particularly in patients of African descent. The study also found a higher frequency of FAM46C mutations in AA patients compared to CA patients, which may indicate a potential role of this gene in multiple myeloma biology among tumors derived from patients of African ancestry. These findings highlight the importance of studying diverse tumor cohorts to better understand the genetic mechanisms of multiple myeloma across different populations. The study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic landscape of multiple myeloma in patients of African descent, which may help address the disparities in incidence and outcomes observed in this population.
Researchers have found that most mutations in cancer cells are "passenger" mutations, which do not affect the cell's reproductive rate. These mutations can provide information about the cancer's evolutionary history and serve as a molecular clock. They can also become targets for immunotherapy or contribute to treatment resistance. By studying the growth of primary tumors or metastatic lesions, scientists have developed a method to calculate the fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive passenger mutations. This allows them to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree of cancer evolution in individual patients.

The researchers have also derived a formula to estimate the number of cancer cells present when a subclonal mutation arose. They found that the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells (δ) determines the shape of the cancer's phylogenetic tree. If δ is close to 1, the tree is star-shaped, indicating slow growth. If δ is close to 0.99, the tree is linear, indicating fast growth.

The study shows that the frequencies of the first and most abundant passenger mutations are influenced by both the mutation rate and the death-birth ratio. If δ is close to 1, several clonal passengers may not have been present in the first tumor cell but were collected during clonal expansion. In contrast, if δ is close to 0.99, there will be about 150 passenger mutations present in more than 1% of cancer cells.

The researchers applied their formula to the TCGA colorectal cancer dataset and found that the branching process model of neutral evolution describes the observed mutation frequencies well. They also found that the number of subclonal mutations with frequency above 50% is approximately equal to the number of clonal passengers collected during tumor progression. This suggests that subtracting the number of subclonal mutations with frequency above 50% from the number of all clonal mutations can estimate the number of clonal mutations present in the first malignant cell.
Researchers studied the misfolding of a protein called huntingtin, which is linked to Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. They used computer simulations to examine how the protein's structure changes when it has a large number of glutamine repeats, which is a hallmark of the disease. The study found that the longer the glutamine repeats, the more likely the protein is to form a misfolded state that can lead to the formation of amyloid aggregates, which are characteristic of the disease. The researchers also discovered that the regions surrounding the glutamine repeats, known as flanking sequences, play a crucial role in determining the protein's misfolding behavior. Specifically, they found that the polyproline regions in the flanking sequences can prevent the glutamine repeats from misfolding, while the N-terminal 17 residues of the protein are more likely to adopt a beta-sheet conformation as the glutamine repeats lengthen. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanism of huntingtin misfolding and aggregation, which could help in the development of strategies to prevent or treat Huntington's disease. The findings suggest that the flanking sequences of the protein are critical in determining its misfolding behavior, and that the length of the glutamine repeats is a key factor in the formation of amyloid aggregates.
Researchers have explored the diversity of CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) in the human microbiome using over 700 shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). CRISPRs are a defense system used by bacteria and archaea to protect against foreign DNA, such as viruses and plasmids. The researchers developed a targeted assembly strategy to identify CRISPRs in metagenomic sequences, which improved detection compared to whole-metagenome assemblies. This approach allowed them to identify known CRISPRs in more human microbiome datasets and discover new ones.

The study found that CRISPR distributions are largely body-site specific, with different body sites having distinct CRISPR profiles. For example, known streptococcal CRISPRs were found in most oral microbiomes, with samples from the same individual and oral site sharing the most spacers. The researchers also identified novel CRISPRs and new CRISPR variants in contigs from whole-metagenome assemblies and used targeted assembly to comprehensively identify these CRISPRs across samples.

The study demonstrates the importance of effective identification and characterization of CRISPR loci in understanding the dynamic ecology of microbiomes. The researchers suggest that CRISPR spacer sequences can be used to trace rare species and virus exposure in individuals. Further analysis is needed to confirm the identification of new virus genomes in metagenome assemblies. Overall, this study provides new insights into the diversity and distribution of CRISPRs in the human microbiome and highlights the potential applications of CRISPRs in understanding human and microbiome biology.
Researchers studied the internal biological clock of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans to understand how it responds to environmental signals like light and temperature. They used a technique called genome-wide expression profiling to identify genes that are turned on and off in a daily cycle. The study found that certain genes in C. elegans exhibit rhythmic expression with a 24-hour period, even when the environment is constant. This suggests that these genes are under the control of a circadian clock. The researchers also found that light and temperature cycles drive the expression of different sets of genes, with some genes responding to light and others responding to temperature. They discovered that a specific gene, TAX-2, plays a crucial role in transducing both light and temperature information to the clock. The study demonstrates that C. elegans has a circadian clock that is entrained by light and temperature, and provides new insights into the evolution and function of this biological mechanism. The findings suggest that C. elegans can be used as a model organism to further study the circadian clock and its role in regulating various biological processes. The study's results also imply that the circadian clock in C. elegans may be distinct from those found in other animals.
Researchers studied yeast cells with mutations in the RAD3 gene, which is similar to a human gene involved in DNA repair and transcription. They found that these yeast cells had a high rate of genetic recombination, which is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes. The researchers used a new method to detect the reciprocal products of mitotic recombination, which allowed them to map the locations of these events throughout the genome. They found that the yeast cells with RAD3 mutations had a 100-fold increase in reciprocal crossovers, which are a type of genetic recombination event.

The researchers also found that three-quarters of these crossovers occurred at the same position in both sister chromatids, while the remaining quarter occurred in single chromatids. They mapped 216 unselected genomic alterations, including crossovers, gene conversions, deletions, and duplications, and found a significant association between the location of these events and regions with elevated gamma-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage. The researchers also identified a hotspot for deletions and duplications at the IMA2 and HXT11 genes near the left end of chromosome XV.

The study suggests that the RAD3 mutations lead to an increase in recombinogenic DNA lesions, which are DNA breaks that can lead to genetic recombination. The researchers propose that these lesions are either unrepaired single-stranded nicks that are converted into single chromatid breaks by DNA replication or DSBs or TFIIH-bound DNA lesions in unreplicated chromosomes that are converted into double sister-chromatid breaks by DNA replication. Both types of lesions are repaired during the S or G2 phase of the cell cycle.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the bacteria Helicobacter pylori regulates the expression of a key protein called SabA. SabA helps the bacteria stick to the lining of the stomach and is important for the bacteria's ability to cause infection. The researchers found that a repetitive DNA sequence, called a T-tract, plays a crucial role in controlling SabA expression. This T-tract is located near the gene that codes for SabA and its length can vary between different strains of the bacteria.

The study found that the length of the T-tract affects the activity of the gene promoter, which is the region of DNA that controls gene expression. When the T-tract is a certain length, it allows the RNA polymerase enzyme to bind to the promoter more easily, resulting in higher levels of SabA expression. Conversely, when the T-tract is shorter or longer, the RNA polymerase has a harder time binding, leading to lower levels of SabA expression.

The researchers also found that the length of the T-tract can vary between different strains of H. pylori, and that this variation can affect the bacteria's ability to bind to sialyl-Lewis x receptors on the surface of stomach cells. This suggests that the T-tract acts as a "rheostat" to fine-tune SabA expression and allow the bacteria to adapt to different environments. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of H. pylori infection and may have implications for the development of new treatments.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the human papillomavirus (HPV) evades the immune system and amplifies its genome in infected cells. They found that the JAK-STAT transcriptional regulator, STAT-5, plays a crucial role in this process. Normally, STAT-5 helps regulate the inflammatory response and cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. However, in HPV-infected cells, the virus activates STAT-5, leading to the activation of the ATM DNA damage pathway. This pathway is responsible for repairing DNA damage, but in the case of HPV, it allows the virus to amplify its genome. The researchers found that inhibiting STAT-5 activation with a drug called pimozide prevents HPV genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating keratinocytes. They also discovered that the STAT-5β isoform is mainly responsible for this activity and that it is mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. Furthermore, they found that a downstream target of STAT-5, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), contributes to the effects on members of the ATM pathway. These findings suggest that STAT-5 is an important regulator of the HPV life cycle and that it promotes viral replication through the activation of the ATM DNA damage response.
Researchers in Nepal used a technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVIAT) to identify potential biomarkers of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi (S. Typhi) infection in individuals who carry the bacteria in their biliary tract without showing symptoms. Chronic carriers of S. Typhi can spread the infection to others and hinder efforts to control typhoid fever outbreaks. The study found 13 S. Typhi antigens that were recognized by the immune system of chronic carriers but not by healthy individuals living in a typhoid-endemic area. One of these antigens, called YncE, showed a strong immune response in 70% of chronic carriers, but not in healthy individuals or those with acute typhoid fever. YncE is an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, suggesting it may play a role in the survival of S. Typhi in the biliary tract. The study's findings could lead to the development of improved diagnostic tests to identify asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers, which is crucial for controlling typhoid fever outbreaks. Further evaluation of YncE and other identified antigens may also provide insights into the mechanisms of S. Typhi infection and persistence in chronic carriers.
Researchers have discovered a new epigenetic phenomenon called trans-reactivation, where a non-functional copy of a gene can reactivate a silenced version of the same gene. This occurs through the presence of homologous RNA molecules produced by the non-functional gene, which can influence the transcriptional state of the silenced gene. The study used the white gene in fruit flies as a model, where a non-functional allele of the gene was found to reactivate a wild-type copy of the gene that was silenced by heterochromatin. This phenomenon is heritable, meaning it can be passed on to future generations, and relies on the presence of diffusible homologous RNAs. Mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing also affect trans-reactivation. The study suggests that trans-reactivation is a new level of gene expression control that can occur in the context of heterochromatic genes. This phenomenon is distinct from other epigenetic reprogramming events, such as paramutation, transinduction, and transvection. The presence of non-functional white alleles was found to increase the expression of the wm4h gene and open up the chromatin structure at the wm4h locus. Overall, the discovery of trans-reactivation provides new insights into the complex regulation of gene expression and highlights the role of homologous RNA molecules in influencing gene activity.
Researchers have studied a protein called Boophilin, found in the midgut of a tick that transmits a disease called babesiosis. Boophilin is a multifunctional inhibitor that targets several enzymes involved in blood clotting and inflammation. These enzymes include thrombin, elastase, kallikrein, and factor XIa. The study found that Boophilin behaves as a classical, non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, meaning it blocks the enzyme's activity without competing with its substrate. Boophilin also inhibits platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in laboratory experiments. Additionally, it prevents the activation of factor XIa and kallikrein, which are involved in the contact pathway of blood clotting. Furthermore, Boophilin inhibits cathepsin G- and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and partially affects elastase-mediated cleavage of a protein called tissue factor pathway inhibitor. In animal experiments, Boophilin was shown to inhibit blood clot formation in a carotid artery and promote bleeding in a mouse tail transection model. The study suggests that Boophilin plays a crucial role in keeping the tick's midgut environment at a low level of blood clotting and inflammation, allowing the tick to successfully digest a blood meal. This is essential for the tick's metabolism and egg development. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Boophilin in tick biology and its potential as a target for antithrombotic therapies.
Researchers have developed a computational model called SEGMEnT to study the relationship between inflammation and tissue patterning in the gut. The model simulates the behavior of gut epithelial cells and their interactions to maintain and modify the enteric mucosal architecture. This architecture is crucial for the gut's function as an absorptive surface and defensive barrier. Inflammation is a significant factor in many gastrointestinal diseases, and understanding its role in tissue patterning is essential for diagnosis, characterization, and pathophysiology.

SEGMEnT integrates multiple functional modules, including morphogenic and inflammatory signaling pathways, cell state transitions, and spatial diffusion of morphogens. The model simulates the spatial dynamics of the crypt-villus tissue architecture, incorporating the effects of inflammation on morphogenic processes. SEGMEnT is designed to represent arbitrarily large and customizable epithelial surfaces and is a work in progress, representing a minimally sufficient set of components and interactions to achieve a face-valid representation of the mechanisms involved in maintaining the enteric mucosal architecture and its response to inflammation.

The model provides insights into clinically relevant cellular-molecular mechanisms, such as the role of PTEN/PI3K in crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis, the protective role of enterocyte sloughing in enteric ischemia-reperfusion, and chronic low-level inflammation as a driver for colonic metaplasia. SEGMEnT can serve as an integrating platform for the study of inflammation in gastrointestinal disease, potentially unifying a broad spectrum of intestinal diseases under a common framework.
Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are a major vector of diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. Traditional control methods like insecticide spraying and source reduction have limited effectiveness. Wolbachia, a bacterium that infects mosquitoes, has been proposed as a promising tool to reduce arbovirus transmission. The wMelBr strain of Wolbachia was released in a community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, but failed to establish itself in the local population due to the high level of pyrethroid resistance in the mosquitoes. The study found that the wMelBr strain had a maternal transmission rate of 97.56%, but the frequency of Wolbachia-positive mosquitoes plateaued at around 40% and then declined after releases stopped. The researchers discovered that the lab colony maintenance procedures had inadvertently selected for pyrethroid-resistant genotypes, which compromised the effectiveness of the Wolbachia invasion. A new strain, wMelRio, was developed by backcrossing wMelBr females with males from the field to introduce pyrethroid resistance alleles. The wMelRio strain was more successful in establishing itself in the local population, despite reducing fecundity traits such as egg clutch size and egg hatch. The study highlights the importance of matching the local population genetics, including insecticide resistance, to achieve Wolbachia invasion. The results suggest that Wolbachia deployment should be tailored to the specific insecticide resistance profile of the wild population to be effective.
Researchers studied the vaccinia virus, a type of poxvirus, to understand how it interacts with the host cell's defense mechanisms. They found that the B1 protein, a kinase, plays a crucial role in inactivating a cellular antiviral factor called BAF. However, they also discovered a pseudokinase, called B12, that represses viral DNA replication in a pathway that is antagonized by the B1 kinase. When the B1 gene was deleted from the virus, the researchers observed a significant increase in viral titer after several passages. They identified mutations that correlated with a loss of function of the B12 pseudokinase, which provided a fitness enhancement to the virus. These findings suggest that gene loss can be beneficial for the virus. The researchers also found that expression of the full-length B12 protein leads to a fitness reduction in viruses with a defect in B1, but has no apparent impact on wild-type virus or other mutant poxviruses. This indicates that B12 possesses a potent inhibitory activity that can be masked by the presence of the B1 kinase. Further investigation revealed that B12 primarily localizes to the nucleus and may enhance the antiviral activity of BAF. The study presents novel evidence that a paralogous kinase-pseudokinase pair can exhibit a unique epistatic relationship in a virus, which may serve to enhance B1 conservation during poxvirus evolution and orchestrate nuclear events during infection.
Researchers studied the behavior of two synthetic peptides, LK and EALA, with built-in secondary amphiphilicity, to understand how they fold and interact with their environment. These peptides are too short to form stable structures on their own and are often found in a disordered state in solution. The team used molecular dynamics simulations to analyze the peptides' conformational behavior in bulk water and in the presence of macroscopic and molecular interfaces.

In bulk water, the peptides were found to be neither random coils nor fully formed alpha-helices, but instead adopted multiple conformations and secondary structure elements with short lifetimes. The simulations showed that the peptides' conformational preferences were influenced by environmental conditions such as pH, salts, and the presence of interfaces. When exposed to a macroscopic vacuum/water interface, the peptides adopted a more stable alpha-helical form, with the hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues partitioning in a way that stabilized the helix.

The researchers found that the peptides' aggregation behavior was also affected by the presence or absence of an interface, as well as their surface charge and hydrophobicity. The study suggests that the peptides' conformational behavior is highly dependent on their environment, and that interfaces can play a crucial role in stabilizing specific conformations. Overall, the research provides insights into the complex behavior of intrinsically disordered peptides and their interactions with their surroundings.
Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and 6B (HHV-6B) are common viruses that infect humans in early childhood and remain dormant in various cell types. Research has shown that both viruses can integrate their genomes into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells, but the mechanism behind this process has been unclear. Telomeric repeats (TMR) in the HHV-6A and HHV-6B genomes are similar to human telomere sequences and have been proposed to facilitate integration. To investigate this, scientists deleted the TMR in the HHV-6A genome and found that the virus could still replicate, but its ability to integrate into host chromosomes was severely impaired. This suggests that TMR are crucial for the maintenance of the virus genome in latently infected cells. Further analysis revealed that the perfect TMR (pTMR) play a major role in integration, while the imperfect TMR (impTMR) make a minor contribution. The study provides new insights into the mechanism of HHV-6A integration and suggests that TMR facilitate integration into host telomeres through homologous recombination. The findings have implications for understanding the persistence of HHV-6 in the host and may shed light on the role of TMR in other herpesviruses.
Researchers have made a significant discovery in understanding how poxviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as smallpox and cowpox, assemble their outer membrane. Unlike other enveloped viruses, poxviruses do not acquire their membrane by budding through cellular compartments. Instead, they form immature particles from crescent-shaped precursors. A key component of these precursors is a protein called D13, which is a double-barrel scaffolding protein. The researchers have determined the 2.6 Å crystal structure of D13 and found that it folds into two jellyrolls with a novel head domain. When attached to artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice that resembles the structure of the viral crescents and immature particles. This suggests that D13 plays a crucial role in the assembly of poxviruses. The researchers also found that D13 has the ability to remodel lipids, which is essential for the formation of the viral membrane. This process is similar to that of other icosahedral DNA viruses that infect all kingdoms of life. The discovery of D13's structure and its lipid-remodeling abilities provides new insights into the assembly of poxviruses and could lead to the development of new antiviral therapies. The researchers also found that D13 is a target for the antibiotic rifampicin, which could be used to inhibit viral assembly.
Researchers studied a plant called Brachypodium distachyon, a distant relative of the well-studied plant Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that a mutation in a gene called BdTAR2L, which is involved in auxin biosynthesis, led to dramatic elongation of the plant's seminal roots. This was surprising because similar mutations in Arabidopsis resulted in reduced root growth. The researchers discovered that the Brachypodium mutant had elevated levels of auxin, a hormone that promotes cell growth, rather than reduced levels as expected. They also found that treating wild-type Brachypodium plants with a specific inhibitor of auxin biosynthesis, L-kynerunine, resulted in elevated auxin levels and exaggerated cell elongation, mimicking the mutant phenotype. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants treated with L-kynerunine had reduced auxin levels and impaired root growth. The researchers propose that in Brachypodium, ethylene, another hormone, inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis, leading to sub-optimal auxin levels for root cell elongation. This suggests an alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk in Brachypodium compared to Arabidopsis. The study reveals a delicate balance between auxin and ethylene activity in controlling cell elongation in Brachypodium roots.
Researchers studied how genes evolve at different rates in species of the budding yeast. They found that genes with a specific type of nucleosome organization, called Occupied Proximal Nucleosomes (OPN), vary widely in expression between species. In contrast, genes with Depleted Proximal Nucleosomes (DPN) have largely conserved expression levels. To investigate this difference, the researchers artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins in yeast. They found that selection was successful for both OPN and DPN genes, with about 80% of genes in each group increasing in expression by a similar amount. However, the two groups adapted to selection through different mechanisms: DPN genes duplicated large genomic regions, while OPN genes favored trans mutations not involving duplications. When selection was removed, DPN genes quickly returned to their original expression levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species. The study suggests that the organization of promoter nucleosomes constrains early evolutionary dynamics and biases the path of long-term evolution. This means that the structure of a gene's promoter region can influence how it evolves over time.
The human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) trans-activator/oncoprotein, Tax, activates the I-κB kinases (IKKs) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), promoting cell proliferation and transformation. However, in most cells, Tax expression leads to the up-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p21CIP1/WAF1 and p27KIP1, causing p53-/pRb-independent cellular senescence. Researchers found that p21CIP1/WAF1-/p27KIP1-mediated senescence acts as a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation. In HeLa cells, Tax-induced senescence was attenuated by mutations that reduce IKK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB using a degradation-resistant mutant of I-κBα. The study also showed that RelA induces this senescence program by acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex and RelB to stabilize p27KIP1 protein and p21CIP1/WAF1 mRNA, respectively. Furthermore, down-regulation of NF-κB by the HTLV-1 anti-sense protein, HBZ, delays or prevents the onset of Tax-induced senescence. The researchers propose that the balance between Tax and HBZ expression determines the outcome of HTLV-1 infection, with robust HTLV-1 replication and elevated Tax expression driving IKK/NF-κB hyper-activation and triggering senescence, while HBZ modulates Tax-mediated viral replication and NF-κB activation, allowing HTLV-1-infected cells to proliferate, persist, and evolve.
A new computational model of human executive function has been proposed to explain decision-making in everyday environments with uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations. The model, called the PROBE model, suggests that the human frontal lobe function monitors up to three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict action outcomes. When one strategy appears more reliable than others, it is chosen to guide the selection and learning of actions that maximize rewards. If no reliable strategy is found, a new behavioral strategy is tentatively formed from those stored in long-term memory, probed, and if competitive, used to drive action.

The model reveals that the human executive function has a limited monitoring capacity, which is compensated by a binary structure of executive control that promotes the exploration and creation of new behavioral strategies in ambiguous and unknown situations. The PROBE model integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in the service of decision-making and adaptive behavior. It suggests how the frontal lobes create and manage an expanding repertoire of flexible behavioral strategies for driving action in uncertain, changing, and open-ended environments.

The model also explains how the frontal lobe function manages task sets, or active representations of behavioral strategies stored in long-term memory, for driving action. According to the model, the task set is adjusted according to outcome values for maximizing action utility, and the frontal executive function continuously arbitrates between adjusting and staying with the current task set, switching to other learned task sets, and creating new task sets for driving action.
Researchers have developed a new modeling approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological interventions. This approach uses mathematical modeling to predict how molecular adaptations change over time in response to treatment. ADAPT introduces a concept of time-dependent descriptions of model parameters to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations, making use of experimental data obtained during different stages of an intervention. The approach aims to dynamically link different experimentally observed phenotypes as a function of time, providing an integrated understanding of the outcome of a pharmacological intervention or disease progression.

ADAPT was applied to a model of hepatic lipid and plasma lipoprotein metabolism to predict the metabolic adaptations induced upon pharmacological treatment of mice with the liver X receptor (LXR) agonist T0901317. The results showed that the hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol was reduced upon prolonged treatment, despite activation of LXR promoting cholesterol efflux and excretion. This prediction was confirmed experimentally by immunoblotting measurements of the scavenger receptor class B1 (SR-B1) in hepatic membranes.

The ADAPT approach can be used to identify potential unwanted side effects of pharmacological interventions and to design new target interventions to prevent these side effects. It can also be used to study the dynamics of molecular adaptations in response to treatment, providing insight into the underlying biological systems and identifying molecular events that should be studied in more detail to unravel the mechanistic basis of treatment outcome.
Researchers have proposed a new hypothesis to explain how the brain's cerebellum coordinates the movement of multi-segmented limbs and bodies. The cerebellum receives sensory and motor signals from the spinal cord, but it's unclear why these signals are combined in the neurons of origin of the spinocerebellar pathways. The researchers suggest that the spinal circuitry provides useful recombinations of these signals, which can be described as linear projections through the multi-dimensional sensorimotor input space. The cerebellar granule layer enhances the utility of these projections by allowing the Purkinje cell to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. This hypothesis provides a novel view on the function of the spinal circuitry and cerebellar granule layer, illustrating how the coordinating functions of the cerebellum can be supported by the recombinations performed by the neurons of the spinocerebellar systems. The researchers argue that the close correspondence between sensor signals and motor command signals in individual neurons allows the spinocerebellar system to avoid superfluous recombinations and form "good enough" recombinations with a high probability. They propose that the spinal circuitry makes sensorimotor functions available to the cerebellar cortex through its MF projections via the SCT/SRCT systems, and that the structure of the spinocerebellar network prior to the granule layer plays a crucial role in explaining how the curse of dimensionality can be lifted.
Researchers have used next-generation sequencing to study the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression and play a crucial role in various cellular processes. The study found that CHIKV infection alters the expression of 77 miRNAs in Aedes albopictus, with eight miRNAs showing significant changes. These miRNAs are involved in various pathways, including cell development, proliferation, and host defense.

The researchers identified 88 and 79 known miRNAs in uninfected and CHIKV-infected Aedes albopictus cells, respectively. They also discovered nine novel miRNAs in the mosquito cells. By comparing the miRNA profiles of infected and uninfected cells, the researchers found that CHIKV infection specifically altered the expression of eight miRNAs. These miRNAs were predicted to target various pathways, including those involved in cell development, proliferation, and host defense.

The study provides new insights into the role of miRNAs in the development of CHIKV in Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The findings suggest that miRNAs play a crucial role in the regulation of gene expression during CHIKV infection. The study also highlights the potential of miRNAs as targets for developing antiviral strategies against CHIKV. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of miRNAs in CHIKV infection and to explore their potential as therapeutic targets.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic infection affecting humans and livestock, has a significant economic impact in many developing countries, including Iran. A recent study aimed to determine the monetary burden of CE in Iran by analyzing epidemiological and economic data from 2000 to 2009. The study estimated that the mean number of surgical CE cases per year was 1,295, and the number of asymptomatic individuals living in the country was approximately 635,232. The overall annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at $232.3 million, including both direct and indirect costs. The cost associated with human CE was estimated at $93.39 million, while the annual cost associated with CE in livestock was estimated at $132 million. The cost per surgical human case was estimated at $1,539. The study found that CE has a considerable economic impact on Iran, accounting for approximately 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. The study suggests that establishing a CE surveillance system and implementing a control program are necessary to reduce the economic burden of CE on the country.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPyV) infection in mouse cells, providing new insights into the virus's life cycle and its impact on host cell gene expression. The study used deep sequencing to examine the viral and host transcriptomes at various times after infection, revealing a dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression. The analysis showed that both early-strand and late-strand RNAs are transcribed throughout the infection process, and that the virus undergoes widespread RNA editing, particularly at late times in infection.

The study found that 359 host genes are significantly upregulated and 857 are downregulated by 36 hours after infection. Gene ontology analysis revealed that transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, and RNA processing are upregulated, while those involved in extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, and zinc finger binding are downregulated. The levels of long noncoding RNAs, such as MALAT1, were also altered, with some being upregulated and others downregulated.

The findings provide a detailed picture of how viral gene expression changes throughout the life cycle of MPyV and how infection impacts host cell gene expression. The study also reveals new insights into viral gene regulation, including changes in apparent start sites of early transcripts and extensive RNA editing throughout the viral genome. These results contribute to our understanding of the MPyV life cycle and its effects on host cell growth and metabolism.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, but more than two-fifths experience severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as "hitting the wall." Previous studies have suggested that human glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making "hitting the wall" seem inevitable, or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon without exhaustion. However, a new computational study reveals that the energetic constraints on endurance runners are more subtle and depend on several physiologic variables, including muscle mass distribution, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed.

The study demonstrates that carbohydrate loading prior to marathon running influences performance by allowing runners to run at greater speeds without exhausting glycogen reserves. Typical levels of glycogen loading permit runners to complete a marathon safely in between four and five hours. The study also reveals the functional dependencies of the distance required to run glycogen stores to depletion and the fastest pace at which a given distance, such as the marathon, can be run without exhausting glycogen stores.

The model incorporates the metabolic cost of running and the known dependence of fat versus carbohydrate metabolism on relative exertion. This work provides a basis for guidelines ensuring the safety and optimizing the performance of endurance runners by setting personally appropriate paces and prescribing midrace fueling requirements for avoiding "the wall." The study also sheds light on important standards in marathon running, such as qualifying times for the Boston Marathon.
Researchers studied how different strains of the parasite Toxoplasma gondii interact with mouse immune cells called macrophages. They infected macrophages with 29 different Toxoplasma strains from around the world and used a technique called RNA-sequencing to analyze the genetic activity of both the parasite and the host cells. The study found that different Toxoplasma strains have unique interactions with macrophages, leading to varying levels of gene expression in both the parasite and the host cells. The researchers identified clusters of genes that are co-regulated in both the parasite and the host cells, and found that some strains of Toxoplasma are better at evading the host's immune response than others. They also discovered that some strains of Toxoplasma can activate an inflammatory response in macrophages, while others do not. The study suggests that the genotype of the parasite strain plays a significant role in the outcome of Toxoplasmosis, a disease caused by Toxoplasma infection. The researchers identified novel strain-specifically regulated host pathways, including the regulation of the type I interferon response, which is a key part of the immune response to viral infections. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between Toxoplasma and its host cells, and highlights the importance of considering the genetic diversity of the parasite in understanding the disease.
Researchers have investigated the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows these viruses to acquire new genetic material and adapt to their environment. They used a novel approach to study heterologous recombination in polioviruses, resulting in the isolation of intermediate chimeric viruses with extensive duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. By serially passing these viruses, the researchers found that progeny with increased fitness emerged, having lost the duplicated sequences. This suggests that recombination in enteroviruses is a biphasic process, where an initial recombination event is followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness.

The study analyzed a large panel of intertypic poliovirus recombinants and found that 70% of them contained additional sequences at the recombination junction. This is in contrast to previous reports of precise recombinants, which did not contain extra sequences. The researchers also found that mutations or inhibitors that altered polymerase fidelity or replication complex coalescence affected the yield of recombinants, indicating that the process is replicative.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of "evolution by duplication" in positive-strand RNA viruses. The researchers propose that extant recombinants result from a biphasic process, where an initial recombination event is followed by a process of resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing viral fitness. This process may have implications for the emergence of novel neuropathogenic variants of poliovirus and other enteroviruses.
Researchers have identified a new route for the clearance of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (NE), in white adipose tissue (WAT). This route is mediated by the organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3), which is highly expressed in WAT and has a high uptake rate of NE. Unlike other known routes, such as sympathetic neurons or macrophages, Oct3 is a selective non-neural route of NE clearance in white adipocytes. The study found that adipocytes express high levels of NE degradation enzymes, providing the molecular basis for NE clearance by adipocytes together with its reuptake transporter Oct3.

In mice, ablation of Oct3 resulted in higher body temperature, thermogenesis, and lipolysis compared to controls. After a prolonged cold challenge, WAT in Oct3-deficient mice showed stronger browning characteristics and elevated expression of thermogenic and mitochondrial biogenesis genes. This response involved enhanced β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase A (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding protein (Creb) pathway activation. The study also found that inhibition of β-AR largely abolished the higher lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct3-deficient WAT, indicating NE overload in the vicinity of adipocytes.

Reduced functional alleles in human OCT3 were associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). The study suggests that Oct3 governs β-AR activity as a NE recycling transporter in white adipocytes, offering potential therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders. The results demonstrate that Oct3 is essential for catecholamine clearance in adipocytes of WAT and blunts intracellular responses upon sustained catecholamine stimulation by regulating the activity of β-AR.
HP1 proteins play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by repressing transcription. These proteins contain two domains: the chromo-domain (CD) and the chromoshadow-domain (CSD). The CD binds to histone H3 tails that are methylated on lysine 9, a mark associated with transcriptional repression. However, the affinity of HP1 proteins to native methylated chromatin is relatively poor, and they require chromatin opening during DNA replication to bind to nucleosomes. Researchers investigated whether HP1 proteins have additional histone binding activities and found that the CSD interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome barrel. This region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the human SWI/SNF complex, Brg1 and Brm. In vitro experiments showed that efficient SWI/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited in the presence of HP1 proteins. The antagonism between SWI/SNF and HP1 proteins is also observed in vivo on interferon-regulated genes. Furthermore, SWI/SNF activity favors the loading of HP1 proteins to chromatin both in vivo and in vitro. The study suggests that HP1 chromoshadow-domains can benefit from the opening of nucleosomal structures to bind chromatin and that HP1 proteins use this property to detect and arrest unwanted chromatin remodeling.
Researchers have identified a property of modular RNA structures called self-containment, which refers to the tendency of an RNA sequence to maintain its optimal secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. To measure this property, a scoring method called the self-containment index was developed. The study found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway. In contrast, most other structured RNAs do not display high self-containment. Further analysis revealed a trend toward higher self-containment among clustered and conserved miRNAs, suggesting that high self-containment may be a characteristic of novel miRNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. The study also found that miRNAs display significantly enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and a trend toward natural selection for self-containment in most functional RNA classes. The researchers suggest that self-containment arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of structural function. The study's findings have implications for the annotation and design of functional RNAs, and a Python implementation and Web interface to calculate the self-containment index are available online.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of fungal necrotrophic pathogens. These TFs, named ZFP2, BHLH99, PAP2, and AT1G66810, were found to be essential for plant resistance to two types of fungal pathogens, Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaerella cucumerina. When these TFs are defective, Arabidopsis plants become more susceptible to disease, and a specific set of non-immune host processes are activated, contributing to plant disease susceptibility.

Transcriptome analyses revealed that the mutants share a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes, which encode peptides with a secretion signal. These peptides, named PROVIR factors, were found to be important for disease susceptibility of the host to fungal necrotrophs. Over-expression of many of the PROVIR factors in Arabidopsis increased susceptibility to the necrotroph P. cucumerina, while loss-of-function mutants conferred increased resistance.

The identification of these TFs and PROVIR factors provides new insights into the genetic determinants of plant disease susceptibility to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. These findings highlight the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-pathogen interactions and may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling fungal diseases in plants. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of these TFs and PROVIR factors in plant disease susceptibility and to explore their potential as targets for disease control.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the transcription factor FOXO1 in regulating uterine receptivity and embryo implantation. In a study using a mouse model, they found that ablation of FOXO1 in the uterus led to infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and increased apoptosis, preventing the embryo from penetrating the uterine lining. Analysis of the uterine transcriptome revealed changes in gene expression related to cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, and signaling pathways, including the β-catenin (CTNNB1) pathway and progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling.

The study also found that PGR expression was retained in the uterine epithelium during the window of receptivity, which inhibited FOXO1 expression in the nucleus. This reciprocal relationship between PGR and FOXO1 was also observed in human endometrial samples during the proliferative and secretory phases. The researchers propose that FOXO1 and PGR may be involved in a mutually regulatory relationship in the endometrial epithelium, with FOXO1 regulating the expression of multiple components of signaling pathways that establish the receptive phase.

The findings suggest that FOXO1 plays a critical role in regulating uterine receptivity and embryo implantation, and that dysregulation of this process may contribute to implantation failure in women experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss or unsuccessful in vitro fertilization cycles. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying uterine receptivity and embryo implantation, and highlights the importance of FOXO1 and PGR in this process.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the spread of dengue fever in Bangladesh, a country where many cases go unreported. They used data from 2000 to 2009 to create a model that accounted for the lack of reported cases, known as zero-inflation. The model showed that higher temperatures and lower temperature differences between day and night were associated with more dengue cases. It also found that densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher dengue incidence. The model estimated that 92% of dengue cases occurred between August and September, with the majority of cases reported in the capital city of Dhaka. However, less than half of the affected districts reported cases, and the proportion of reported cases varied by month and district. The study's findings provide valuable information for prioritizing and targeting dengue control and elimination interventions in Bangladesh. The model-based estimates of spatial variation in monthly dengue cases can help public health officials better understand the spread of the disease and allocate resources more effectively. The study's results also highlight the need to address under-reporting and consider other factors that contribute to geographical variation in dengue transmission, such as climate and socio-demographic factors.
Researchers have identified a new type of preferred place in mice that exhibit exploratory behavior in an open field arena. These places, called "knots," are characterized by high path tortuosity, with mice tracing tortuous paths full of twists and turns within them. Knots are distinct from "home bases," which are typically marked by long visits and high cumulative time spent in the area. Unlike home bases, knots are not characterized by long visits, but rather by sporadic recurrent visits and a higher speed on the way into the knot than on the way out. Mice tend to perform knot-scribbling, a behavior that involves tracing a tortuous path, at the point of introduction into the arena, even though they leave these places immediately after being placed there. The establishment of knots is enhanced by injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena, suggesting that stress and arousal play a role in consolidating a long-term contingency between a particular locale and knot-scribbling. Knot-scribbling may serve as a way for mice to obtain an overview of their environment, allowing them to re-calibrate their locale map and compass directions. The behavior also generates rich vestibular input, which could improve the interpretation of the visual scene.
Scientists have discovered a new potential treatment for fungal infections, which are responsible for more deaths worldwide than malaria. They found a compound called NGx04 that selectively kills fungal cells without harming human cells. Further research revealed that NGx04 targets a protein called Sec14p, which is essential for the growth and virulence of certain fungal pathogens, including Cryptococcus neoformans. This protein is involved in the transfer of lipids and the secretion of virulence factors, making it a promising target for antifungal therapy.

Studies showed that NGx04 inhibits the growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoformans and that related compounds have even higher potency against this pathogen. The researchers also found that NGx04 is effective against a strain of C. neoformans that is resistant to the commonly used antifungal medication fluconazole. The team used a combination of genetic and chemical assays to understand how NGx04 works and identified four key residues on the Sec14p protein that are essential for its activity.

The discovery of NGx04 and its mechanism of action provides a new starting point for the development of antifungal treatments. The researchers suggest that targeting Sec14p could be a effective way to combat fungal infections, particularly those caused by C. neoformans. Further research is needed to explore the potential of NGx04 and related compounds as antifungal therapies.
Researchers have identified a potential new treatment for schistosomiasis, a tropical disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, may not be effective in the long term due to the development of drug-resistant parasites. A study has found that mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, shows promising antischistosomal properties in mice. Mice infected with adult Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum parasites were given a single dose of mefloquine, resulting in significant reductions in worm burden, ranging from 72.3% to 100%. The study also found that mefloquine was effective against young developing stages of the parasites, which is an advantage over praziquantel.

The researchers tested mefloquine against other antimalarial drugs and found that it was the only one to show significant antischistosomal activity. The study suggests that mefloquine could be a potential new treatment for schistosomiasis. Further research is needed to understand the mechanism of action of mefloquine and to test its effectiveness against other types of schistosomes. The study's findings also raise the possibility that mefloquine could be used to treat schistosomiasis in areas where malaria and schistosomiasis co-exist, as mefloquine is already widely used to treat malaria.
Researchers conducted a study to map the geographical distribution of podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis causing massive swelling of the lower legs, in Cameroon. Podoconiosis was identified as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. The study aimed to generate data on the disease's distribution in Cameroon and contribute to the global atlas of podoconiosis. A multi-stage sampling design was used to survey 76 villages from 40 health districts across the country. All individuals aged 15 and older were screened for lymphedema, and a clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoconiosis, excluding filarial-associated lymphedema. Of the 10,178 participants, 83 individuals with lymphedema were identified, but none were found to be positive for Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis. After applying the clinical algorithm, 52 people were diagnosed with podoconiosis, resulting in an overall prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI: 0.4-0.7). Podoconiosis was found to be widespread in Cameroon, present in nine out of ten regions, with the highest prevalence in eight districts ranging from 1.2% to 2.7%. The study demonstrates the need for a health system response to the burden of podoconiosis, including case surveillance and morbidity management services.
Researchers have discovered that a signaling pathway called Notch plays a crucial role in the aging process of stem cells in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. Specifically, they found that Notch signaling increases with age in germline stem cells (GSCs), leading to their removal from their stem cell niche. The niche is a specialized environment that supports the growth and maintenance of stem cells.

The study showed that GSCs with low levels of Notch signaling are more adhesive to the niche, allowing them to outcompete their neighbors with higher levels of Notch. This adhesiveness is regulated by the expression of a protein called E-cadherin. The researchers also found that enhancing Notch signaling in GSCs accelerates their age-dependent loss from the niche, while disrupting Notch signaling in GSCs does not delay their loss.

Interestingly, the study revealed that Notch signaling in the niche itself decreases with age, contributing to the loss of GSCs. This suggests that Notch signaling regulates GSC-niche adhesion both from within the stem cells and from the niche itself. The findings have implications for our understanding of how stem cells age and may also be relevant to the behavior of cancer cells, which often have altered Notch signaling. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex interactions between stem cells and their niche, and highlights the importance of Notch signaling in regulating stem cell aging.
Researchers studied a group of proteins called conserved herpesvirus-encoded protein kinases (CHPKs), which are found in all eight human herpesviruses. These proteins have a similar structure and sequence, but their functions were not well understood. The study found that the CHPKs from the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus families can phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor protein and disrupt the nuclear lamina, similar to cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). This Cdk-like activity was not found in the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs. The researchers also found that the beta- and gamma-herpesvirus CHPKs can act as Cdks in yeast cells, while the alpha-herpesvirus CHPKs cannot. However, the study also found that the non-Cdk-like activities of the CHPKs, such as disrupting promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies and aggresomes, are not well conserved among the different herpesviruses. The study suggests that the CHPKs may have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions during viral infections, and that some of these proteins are targets for approved or developmental antiviral drugs. Overall, the study provides new insights into the functions of the CHPKs and their role in human herpesvirus infections.
A systematic review and consensus guidelines for environmental sampling of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, have been developed to improve the detection of this pathogen in the environment. Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative bacillus found in many tropical countries and is a Tier 1 Select Agent. The global distribution of B. pseudomallei is crucial for developing a risk map for melioidosis, which can inform preventive measures and raise awareness among healthcare workers in affected areas.

A review of 61 environmental studies found that global coverage was patchy, with a lack of studies in areas where melioidosis is suspected to occur. The sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable and not all were robust. To address these issues, an international working party developed consensus guidelines for soil sampling. The guidelines aim to reduce the probability of false-negative results and provide affordable and "low-tech" methodology applicable in both developed and developing countries.

The review found that 82% of environmental studies reported the detection of B. pseudomallei using culture and/or PCR. Strains collected in several countries, including France, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, and Niger, were later confirmed as B. pseudomallei by genotyping. Environmental sampling has been used to identify areas where people are at risk of melioidosis, even before cases are recognized. For example, an environmental survey in Vientiane City, Lao PDR, in 1998 detected B. pseudomallei prior to the recognition of human disease, leading to the identification of over 560 culture-positive melioidosis patients in the following 12 years.
Researchers have discovered a new way to block the entry of dengue virus into cells by targeting a specific step in the virus's fusion process. The virus uses a protein called E to fuse with the cell membrane, allowing it to release its genetic material inside the cell. The researchers found that peptides, short chains of amino acids, derived from the E protein can bind to the virus and prevent it from fusing with the cell membrane. These peptides specifically target a conformational intermediate, or a temporary shape, of the E protein that occurs during the fusion process.

In experiments, the researchers showed that the peptides can block the virus's ability to infect cells, even when the peptides are removed from the virus before it enters the cell. This suggests that the peptides bind to the virus before it attaches to the cell and are carried with the virus into the cell's endosomes, where the fusion process occurs. The researchers propose a two-step model for how the peptides work: first, they bind to the virus and prevent it from fusing with the cell membrane, and second, they are carried with the virus into the endosomes, where they continue to block the fusion process.

The discovery of these peptides could lead to new strategies for preventing dengue virus infection. The researchers suggest that targeting the fusion process could be an effective way to block the virus's entry into cells, and their findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of flavivirus entry.
Researchers have developed a method to sequence the entire genome of Vibrio cholerae, the bacteria responsible for cholera, directly from dried filter paper. This breakthrough has significant implications for controlling and eliminating cholera, a disease that causes an estimated 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths worldwide each year. The new method allows for the analysis of stool specimens preserved on filter paper, which is a low-cost, safe, and sustainable way to collect and store samples in resource-limited settings.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used to recover nearly complete sequences of the V. cholerae O1 genome from stool specimens enriched in alkaline peptone water and culture isolates spotted on filter paper. The minimum concentration of V. cholerae DNA required to produce quality genomic information was 0.02 ng/μL. The genomic data confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci.

WGS also identified a variety of diarrheal pathogens from alkaline peptone water-enriched specimen spotted filter paper, highlighting the potential for this technique to explore the gut microbiome and identify co-infections that may impact the severity of disease. The WGS results allowed for the mapping of short reads from alkaline peptone water-enriched specimen and culture isolate spotted filter papers, providing valuable molecular epidemiological sequence information on V. cholerae strains from remote, low-resource settings.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Dynein plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and organization of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells line the surfaces and cavities of the body and are essential for many bodily functions. Dynein is a motor protein that moves along microtubules in the cell, helping to transport other proteins and molecules to specific locations within the cell. In a study using fruit flies, scientists found that Dynein is necessary for the proper localization of a protein called Stardust (Sdt), which is involved in maintaining epithelial polarity. Epithelial polarity is the arrangement of cells in a specific orientation, which is essential for the proper functioning of epithelial tissues.

The researchers used a genetic screen to identify the role of Dynein in epithelial polarity and found that it is required for the localization of Sdt to the apical surface of epithelial cells. They also discovered that Dynein acts through Sdt to target another protein called Crumbs to the apical surface. Crumbs is a transmembrane protein that is essential for maintaining epithelial polarity. The study also found that the localization of Sdt mRNA, the genetic material that encodes the Sdt protein, is regulated by an alternative splicing mechanism, which is a process that allows for the creation of different versions of a protein from the same gene. This mechanism is used to control the localization of Sdt mRNA during development, with apical transcripts present only during early stages of epithelial development and unlocalized transcripts present in mature epithelia.
Researchers have found evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease spread by sand flies. This exchange occurs within the sand fly vector, where the parasite undergoes a non-obligate sexual cycle. To study this phenomenon, the researchers created transgenic Leishmania infantum lines that expressed drug resistance markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters. They then fed sand flies a mixture of these transgenic lines and found that the cells with identical genotypes could recognize each other and exchange genetic material. The resulting hybrid progeny were triploid, meaning they had three sets of chromosomes, and were stable throughout the parasite's life cycle. The researchers also found that the hybrid clone was less virulent than the parental strains, causing a reduction in parasite loads in mice and lower arginase activity, an enzyme involved in the parasite's virulence. This study provides the first evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in Leishmania infantum and suggests that the parasite can recognize and mate with cells of the same genotype within the sand fly vector. The findings have implications for our understanding of the parasite's life cycle and the development of new treatments for leishmaniasis.
Researchers studied Leishmania donovani parasites from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV-VL co-infections in Ethiopia. They analyzed DNA from 63 strains using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), cysteine protease B (cpb), and HASPB (k26). The results showed that the k26-PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic origin. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290-bp product, while strains from southwestern Ethiopia produced a 450-bp product. Strains from Sudan produced amplicons identical to those in northwestern Ethiopia, and Kenyan strains produced larger products. High-resolution melt (HRM) analysis distinguished the different PCR products. Sequence analysis revealed that the k26 repeat region in L. donovani is comprised of polymorphic 13 and 14 amino acid motifs. The number and order of the repeats in L. donovani varies between geographic regions. The study found considerable polymorphism in the HASPB repeat region among L. donovani strains from different regions in East Africa. This polymorphism should be taken into account when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen. The findings suggest that the genetic diversity of L. donovani strains may impact the effectiveness of these tools.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model to predict the distribution of HIV-1 recombination breakpoints, which are the boundaries that define the mosaic structure of the virus's genome. The model is based on the idea that recombination is influenced by local sequence identity, and it accurately predicts the observed frequencies of inter-subtype recombination across much of the HIV-1 genome. However, in certain regions, such as the env gene, the observed frequencies of recombination breakpoints deviate from the predicted distribution, suggesting that natural selection is influencing the recombination pattern. Specifically, there is a paucity of recombination breakpoints within most of the envelope gene, indicating that recombinants generated in this region are less likely to be successful. On the other hand, there is an over-representation of breakpoints at either side of the env gene, suggesting that recombination events in this region may be favored due to its tendency to be recombined as an entire unit. These findings provide the first clear indication of specific genomic regions that deviate from a probabilistic null model for recombination, and suggest that only a minority of recombination events appear to be significant to the evolution of HIV-1. The study's results have implications for understanding the mechanisms of HIV-1 evolution and the emergence of new viral strains.
Researchers have traditionally used separate statistical methods to address two interconnected problems in computational modeling: estimating individual variation in model parameters and comparing candidate models. However, these methods are interdependent, as the relevant population for estimating model parameters depends on which subjects express the model. A new hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework is proposed to address both problems concurrently. This framework combines previous approaches and has several advantages, including smaller errors in parameter estimation and robust model comparison that is not biased towards overly simplistic models. The HBI method uses variational techniques and a fully Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty at both individual and group levels, enabling statistical tests about group parameters and corresponding statistical errors. The framework is hierarchical, with individual parameters regularized by statistics across all individuals in the group, and Bayesian, with all uncertainties represented by probability distributions. This approach addresses issues of statistical inference over both parameters and models, which have remained elusive with previous hierarchical methods. The HBI framework is shown to outperform other methods in both parameter estimation and model comparison, making it a valuable tool for researchers in neuroscience and other fields.
Researchers have discovered that a specific group of genes called Hox genes play a crucial role in the development of the auditory circuitry in the mouse brainstem. These genes help determine the fate of cells in the rhombomeres, which are the building blocks of the brainstem. The study found that the rhombomere r4 contributes to the formation of sensory and motor components of the auditory system, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, posterior ventral cochlear nuclei, and motor olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of these components is essential for sound perception and depends on the interaction between two specific Hox genes, Hoxb1 and Hoxb2.

In mice with mutated Hoxb1 and Hoxb2 genes, the transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is disrupted, leading to hearing impairments. On the other hand, another Hox gene, Hoxa2, regulates the axon guidance receptor Rig1 and controls contralateral projections from the anterior ventral cochlear nuclei to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. The study suggests that individual rhombomeres and their associated Hox codes control the assembly of distinct, functionally segregated sub-circuits in the developing auditory brainstem. This research provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of the auditory system and highlights the importance of Hox genes in shaping the structure and function of the brain.
Scientists have sequenced the complete genome of a marine bacterium called Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 (Sde 2-40). This bacterium is unique because it can break down a wide variety of complex carbohydrates, including those found in plant cell walls. The genome analysis revealed that Sde 2-40 has an unusually large number of enzymes that can degrade over 10 different complex polysaccharides. Many of these enzymes have novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules, which are thought to be adaptations that help the bacterium break down complex carbohydrates in the marine environment.

The researchers found that the enzymes in Sde 2-40 are regulated by multiple mechanisms, including glucose repression. This means that the bacterium can adjust its enzyme production based on the type of carbohydrate it is breaking down. The study also showed that Sde 2-40 can grow on plants as its sole source of carbon, making it the first marine prokaryote to do so. This is significant because it suggests that Sde 2-40 plays a key role in the marine carbon cycle by breaking down complex polysaccharides from plants, algae, and invertebrates.

The discovery of Sde 2-40's capabilities has important implications for our understanding of the marine ecosystem. The bacterium's ability to break down complex carbohydrates suggests that it may be a "super-degrader" that helps to recycle marine biomass carbon and contribute to atmospheric CO2 inputs. Further study of Sde 2-40 and its enzymes could lead to new insights into the marine carbon cycle and the development of new technologies for breaking down complex carbohydrates.
Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype I (GI) has become the dominant strain in Asia over the past 20 years, replacing genotype III (GIII). To investigate the role of mosquitoes in this shift, researchers exposed Culex pipiens mosquitoes from China to either GI or GIII JEV strains. The study found that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were competent vectors for both GI and GIII JEV infection, with similar infection rates, growth kinetics, and dissemination rates. Both genotypes were detectable in the salivary glands of infected mosquitoes, suggesting a potential for transmission of both viruses. The study also found no significant difference in the transmission rate between GI- and GIII-infected mosquitoes. The results suggest that Cx. pipiens mosquitoes from China may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift, as both GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in these mosquitoes. However, further studies with more JEV strains are needed to confirm this conclusion.
A two-year review of dengue deaths in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014 found that the majority of fatalities occurred in adults between the ages of 15 and 59 years. The study, which analyzed 322 dengue-related deaths, revealed that the median age of those who died was 40.7 years, with half of the victims being female. The most common warning signs reported were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more prevalent in children and abdominal pain more common in adults. However, 22.4% of the patients did not exhibit any warning signs.

The study found that dengue shock syndrome (DSS) was the leading cause of death, accounting for more than 70% of fatalities, followed by severe organ involvement and severe bleeding. The majority of patients (54%) suffered from multi-organ involvement, while 20.2% had no organ involvement. The median duration from first medical contact to death was three days, and only 34% of patients were suspected of having dengue at their initial presentation.

The study highlights the need for early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent dengue-related deaths. It also emphasizes the importance of strengthening the surveillance system to capture dengue-related deaths that occur outside of hospital settings. The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of dengue deaths in Malaysia, which can inform public health strategies to mitigate the impact of this disease.
Researchers studied how female fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, choose their mates and what makes them attractive to males. They found that insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, plays a key role in determining female attractiveness. Insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells sends signals to pheromone-producing cells called oenocytes, which produce cuticular hydrocarbons that make up the female's pheromone profile. The researchers manipulated insulin signaling in different tissues to see how it affected attractiveness and found that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells increased attractiveness, while insulin signaling in the fat body decreased it. They also found that manipulating insulin signaling in the fat body produced opposite effects on attractiveness compared to manipulating it in the ovarian follicle cells. This suggests that insulin signaling in the fat body and ovarian follicle cells work together to create a system where female attractiveness is linked to an organismal state of high fecundity. The researchers also found that the cues themselves, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded distinctly to fat body and follicle cell manipulations, indicating independent readouts of the pathway activity from these two tissues. This study provides new insights into how female attractiveness is determined and how it is linked to an organismal state of high fecundity.
Researchers analyzed data from the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone to understand how the virus spread at a local level. They used statistical modeling to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0), which measures how easily the virus spreads, for each district in the three countries. The results showed that R0 varied significantly between districts, ranging from 0.36 to 3.37. At the national level, the estimated R0 was 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra Leone. The study found that districts with higher population density and wealth index had a higher R0, suggesting that rapid urbanization may have contributed to the spread of the virus. The researchers used a mixed effects model to account for differences between and within countries, and found that this approach was effective in quantifying local epidemic growth. The study's findings support the idea that geographical heterogeneity played a significant role in the transmission of EVD in West Africa. The results also highlight the importance of considering local factors, such as urbanization, in understanding the spread of infectious diseases.
Researchers studied how the age of a protein and its structure influence its rate of evolution. They used a large dataset of proteins from humans and mice to examine the relationship between protein age, structure, and evolutionary rate. The study found that proteins with certain structural properties, such as high solvent accessibility, evolve more quickly, regardless of their age. However, the age of a protein also plays a significant role in determining its evolutionary rate. Younger proteins tend to evolve faster than older proteins, even if they have similar structural properties.

The researchers also found that older proteins are more stable and robust to mutations than younger proteins. They used a new computational method to study the stability of proteins and found that older proteins are more stable in their native structure and more resistant to mutations. The study suggests that both intrinsic factors, such as a protein's structure, and historical factors, such as its age, contribute to its evolutionary rate.

The researchers ruled out the possibility that differences in structural properties among age groups could explain the relationship between age and evolutionary rate. Instead, they found that age modulates the relationship between solvent accessibility and evolutionary rate, and that younger proteins, despite being less designable, tend to evolve faster than older proteins. Overall, the study highlights the complex interplay between protein age and structure in determining evolutionary rates.
Researchers have identified a new component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), called Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl3), that plays a crucial role in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). PRC2 is a complex of proteins that helps regulate gene expression by adding a chemical tag to histone proteins, called H3K27me3, which silences gene expression. Pcl3 interacts with the core components of PRC2, including Suz12, and promotes the formation of H3K27me3, which is essential for ESC self-renewal.

Studies have shown that knocking down Pcl3 in ESCs leads to increased spontaneous differentiation, but does not affect early differentiation decisions. This suggests that Pcl3 has a specific role in regulating ESC self-renewal. Furthermore, reducing Pcl3 levels decreases H3K27me3 levels, while overexpressing Pcl3 increases H3K27me3 levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that Pcl3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of Pcl3 decreases Suz12 binding at over 60% of PRC2 targets.

The researchers also found that Pcl3 binds to a subset of PRC2 targets, particularly CpG islands, which are regions of the genome that regulate gene expression. Mutation of conserved residues within the Pcl3 Tudor domain, which is involved in recognizing methylated histones, compromises H3K27me3 formation. This suggests that the Tudor domain of Pcl3 is essential for its function. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Pcl3 in PRC2 function and its role in regulating ESC self-renewal and gene expression.
Researchers studied how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans adjusts its chemosensory behavior in response to changes in its feeding state. They focused on a specific chemoreceptor gene called srh-234, which is expressed in a type of sensory neuron called ADL. The team found that the expression of srh-234 is regulated by two types of transcription factors: MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors. These factors work together to control the expression of srh-234 as a function of the worm's feeding state.

The researchers identified a specific DNA sequence, known as a MEF2 binding site, that is necessary and sufficient for the starvation-induced downregulation of srh-234 expression. They also found that another DNA sequence, an E-box motif, is required to drive srh-234 expression in ADL neurons. Furthermore, the team discovered that bHLH transcription factors, including HLH-2, HLH-3, and HLH-4, act in ADL neurons to regulate srh-234 expression.

Interestingly, the researchers found that the expression of srh-234 in ADL neurons is also regulated remotely by transcription factors in the worm's intestine, specifically MXL-3 and HLH-30. This regulation is dependent on insulin signaling in ADL neurons and involves a subset of insulin-like peptides. These findings suggest that chemoreceptor gene expression in C. elegans is regulated by both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms, allowing the worm to fine-tune its chemosensory responses to changes in its feeding state.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the presence of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer disease in humans in southeastern Australia. They collected mosquitoes from seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria, Australia, from 2004 to 2009 and tested them for M. ulcerans using real-time PCR. During the same period, they tallied the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Buruli ulcer in permanent residents of these towns to determine the average cumulative incidence of the disease in each location.

The study found a strong correlation between the detection of M. ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer disease in humans. The results showed a dose-response relationship between the proportion of M. ulcerans-positive mosquitoes in each town and the incidence of Buruli ulcer in the same location. The association was strongest in towns with the highest incidence of Buruli ulcer and the highest proportion of M. ulcerans-positive mosquitoes.

The study suggests that mosquitoes play a role in the transmission of M. ulcerans to humans in southeastern Australia. The findings have implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent Buruli ulcer disease. The researchers recommend that public health measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged in endemic areas. The study's results also raise questions about the potential role of mosquitoes in the transmission of M. ulcerans in other regions, such as Queensland and Africa, where Buruli ulcer is also prevalent.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in rats that causes demyelination, a condition where the protective covering of nerve fibers in the central nervous system breaks down. This mutation, known as dmy, results in severe demyelination after normal myelination is complete. The researchers used positional cloning to pinpoint the mutation to a gene called Mrs2, which encodes a magnesium (Mg2+) channel in mitochondria. The mutation creates a novel splice acceptor site, leading to the inactivation of the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2-cDNA confirmed the findings.

The researchers found that rats with the dmy mutation have significant mitochondrial deficits, including elevated lactic acid levels, reduced ATP production, and increased numbers of swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocytes. They also observed that MRS2, the protein encoded by the Mrs2 gene, is predominantly expressed in neurons, not oligodendrocytes, and is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria.

The study suggests that the demyelination in dmy rats is likely caused by a mitochondrial disease, and that Mg2+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for maintaining myelin. The researchers propose that the dmy rat could be a useful model for investigating the pathophysiology of demyelination diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, which also involves mitochondrial dysfunction.
Microarray gene expression signatures have the potential to improve disease diagnosis and prognosis, but current documentation standards hinder their application in clinical practice. A study analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies and found that discrepancies between study-internal and study-external diagnoses can be as high as 30% in the worst-case scenario and 18% on average. This is due to the lack of clear documentation of the signatures, which makes it difficult to apply them to patients outside of the original study.

The researchers propose a new documentation strategy, called "documentation by value," which involves documenting quantitative preprocessing information. This approach significantly reduces the discrepancy between study-internal and study-external diagnoses, from 18% to 1% on average. The study highlights the importance of clear documentation in evaluating microarray gene expression diagnostic signatures and bringing them to clinical practice.

The researchers analyzed eight clinical microarray studies involving different disease types and diagnostic classification problems. They found that the consistency of diagnoses based on gene expression diagnostic signatures depends heavily on the documentation of the signature. The proposed documentation by value strategy was found to be the most effective in achieving optimal consistency.

The study emphasizes the need for unambiguous documentation of gene expression signatures to facilitate their use in clinical practice. This includes communicating the signatures to other healthcare centers for external evaluation and ultimately to practitioners for use in clinical routine. The researchers believe that documentation does not receive sufficient attention and propose guidelines and methodology for building and documenting signatures unambiguously.
Researchers have gained new insights into the structure of curli amyloid fibrils, which are secreted by certain bacteria and play a key role in biofilm formation. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are resistant to environmental stressors. The major curli subunit, CsgA, was found to form steric zipper fibrils composed of tightly mated beta-sheets, revealing a structural link between curli and human pathological amyloids, such as those associated with Alzheimer's disease.

Two D-enantiomeric peptides, originally designed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-beta, were found to inhibit CsgA fibrillation and reduce biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Additionally, CsgA fibrils were shown to cross-seed fibrillation of amyloid-beta, suggesting a potential for cross-species amyloid interactions. These findings provide a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms and suggest that anti-amyloid compounds could be repurposed as anti-biofilm agents.

The study also highlights the conserved nature of amyloid protein folding and aggregation patterns across different species. The curli biogenesis machinery is designed to secrete, nucleate, and elongate extracellular amyloid fibrils that participate in biofilm formation and stability. The structural insights gained from this study may have implications for understanding the formation of self-propagating prion-like species originating from a microbial source that could influence neurodegenerative diseases.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a significant cause of encephalitis in most of Asia, with high case fatality rates and long-term health consequences for survivors. In the Philippines, JEV has been identified as a cause of encephalitis since 1943, but the epidemiology of the disease in the country has not been well defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 found that JEV was the causative agent in 7-18% of cases of clinical meningitis and encephalitis combined, and 16-40% of clinical encephalitis cases. The disease predominantly affects children under 15 years of age, with 6-7% of cases resulting in death. Surveillance data from 2011 to 2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed JE cases out of 497 tested.

The review found that JEV is endemic in all regions of the Philippines, with epidemiologic characteristics comparable to those found in other endemic countries in Asia. The evidence suggests that JE constitutes a significant public health burden in all regions of the Philippines, supporting consideration of the inclusion of JE vaccine in the national immunization program. The review also highlights the need for continued and improved surveillance with laboratory confirmation to quantify the burden of JE, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and measure the impact of preventive measures, including immunization.
Researchers conducted a large-scale computational study to investigate the origins of genetic robustness in bacterial species. They analyzed the metabolic networks of hundreds of bacterial species across various simulated growth environments. The study found that variations in genetic robustness among species reflect ecological adaptations. The researchers decoupled metabolic robustness into two components: environmental-dependent and environmental-independent. The environmental-dependent component accounts for at least 20% of non-essential reactions and is associated with a species' lifestyle, with specialized species showing higher robustness. The environmental-independent component is associated with a species' intrinsic metabolic capacities, with faster-growing species and those producing more secondary metabolites showing higher robustness. The study also identified reactions in human pathogens that are uniquely susceptible to perturbations, potentially serving as novel drug targets.
Researchers conducted a study in Uganda to investigate the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the immune response to measles vaccination in pre-school children. The study involved 193 children infected with S. mansoni and 61 uninfected children, aged 3-5 years, who received measles catch-up immunization. The researchers found that S. mansoni-infected children had lower levels of antibodies against measles one week after immunization compared to uninfected children. This suggests that S. mansoni infection may impair the immune response to measles vaccination.

The study also examined the effect of praziquantel treatment on the immune response to measles vaccination in S. mansoni-infected children. The results showed that children who received praziquantel treatment before or at the time of immunization had higher levels of antibodies against measles one week after immunization compared to those who did not receive treatment. However, children who were still infected with S. mansoni at 24 weeks after immunization had lower levels of antibodies against measles compared to those who became stool-negative.

The study's findings suggest that S. mansoni infection may contribute to impaired vaccine responses in endemic populations, and that effective schistosomiasis control may be beneficial for vaccine efficacy. The researchers recommend further exploration of this relationship to better understand the impact of S. mansoni infection on vaccine responses in tropical settings.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the evolution of bacterial populations through large-scale sequencing of population samples. However, traditional statistical methods for evolutionary inference, such as phylogenetic analysis, have limitations when dealing with extensive sampling scenarios and high levels of recombination. To address this, new statistical tools have been developed to detect and represent recombination between populations. These tools are part of the BAPS 5.2 software, which is freely available for download.

The new approach combines population genetic tools with phylogenetic analysis to provide a more comprehensive understanding of bacterial population structures. This is demonstrated using extensive real data from the Neisseria genus, which is known to have high levels of recombination and horizontal gene flow. The researchers used a simplified evolutionary model to generate a population sample of 5086 strains, representing Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria lactamica species.

The new statistical tools in BAPS 5.2 enable the analysis of bacterial population structures on a large scale, which was previously not possible due to computational complexity. This approach can be applied to other bacterial genera, such as those hosted on the MLST (Multilocus Sequence Typing) database, which is growing rapidly. The Neisseria species were chosen for validation due to their high levels of recombination and horizontal gene flow, making them an ideal test case for the new approach.
Researchers have found that rhythmic brain activity in the beta frequency band, around 20 Hz, plays a crucial role in our ability to focus attention. This activity, known as top-down beta rhythms, is generated in higher cognitive areas and delivered to earlier sensory areas. A computational model of sensory cortical areas was built to investigate the functional roles of beta rhythms and the underlying mechanisms. The simulation results showed that top-down beta rhythms can activate ascending synaptic projections from layer 5 (L5) to layers 4 and 2/3, which are responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons in L5 were found to resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner. The model predicted that these cells play a critical role in attentional gain, providing a potential mechanism by which cholinergic drive can support selective attention. The results suggest that top-down beta rhythms can enhance gamma rhythms, reduce beta rhythms, and increase spiking activity in layer 2/3, consistent with neural response modulation induced by attention. This study provides evidence that interlaminar interaction, regulated by top-down beta rhythms, supports selective attention. The findings contribute to our understanding of the neural correlates of attentional gain control and the mechanisms underlying biased competition.
Researchers have developed a new method for calibrating and predicting the spread of epidemics using stochastic compartmental models. These models take into account the role of chance events in the early stages of an outbreak, when the number of infected individuals is small. The new method, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), uses a linear noise approximation to describe the fluctuations in the model and updates the estimate of the epidemic state with each new surveillance observation. The researchers tested MSS using simulated outbreaks of a novel viral pathogen and found that it produced accurate estimates of key epidemic parameters, such as the mean duration of infectiousness, the basic reproduction number (R0), and the effective reproduction number (Reff). MSS also accurately predicted the number and timing of future hospitalizations and the overall attack rate. The method outperformed three state-of-the-art benchmark methods in the majority of epidemic scenarios tested. The researchers suggest that MSS could improve current approaches for calibrating and predicting the spread of epidemics, which is crucial for public health decision-making during the early stages of an outbreak.
Researchers have discovered that human visual perception is influenced by two opposing forces: sensory adaptation and past decisions. Sensory adaptation causes perception to move away from previous stimuli, while past decisions attract perception towards the recent past. This phenomenon is known as serial dependence. In a series of experiments, the researchers used multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during adjustment and forced-choice tasks. The results showed that each perceptual report is shaped by a hierarchy of serially dependent processes, with low-level adaptation repelling perception away from previous stimuli and decisional traces attracting perceptual reports towards the recent past. This finding is consistent with a two-process model of serial dependence, where the persistence of readout weights in a decision unit compensates for sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. The researchers propose a unified account of serial dependence, suggesting that functionally distinct mechanisms operating at different stages promote the differentiation and integration of visual information over time. The study provides a comprehensive characterization of visual serial dependence, revealing two contrasting forces that interact in shaping our perception, biasing the appearance of visual stimuli towards or away from the past.
Researchers studied the role of circadian transcription in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, to understand its contribution to core circadian timekeeping. They created a fusion protein called CYC-VP16 by combining the DNA-binding domain of the CYC protein with a potent viral transcriptional activator called VP16. This fusion protein enhanced the transcriptional activity of the CLK-CYC heterodimer, a key circadian transcription complex in Drosophila. Flies expressing CYC-VP16 had increased levels of CLK-CYC direct target gene mRNAs, including those from the per and tim genes, which are crucial for circadian rhythm regulation. These flies also exhibited a short period, indicating that circadian transcription plays a role in period determination. The researchers found that the short period in CYC-VP16-expressing flies was due to a more rapid transcriptional phase, rather than generally higher levels of the PER protein. This suggests that the timing of transcriptional activation, rather than the activation itself, is the key event responsible for the behavioral effects observed in CYC-VP16-expressing flies. The results indicate that circadian transcription contributes to core circadian function in Drosophila, and that the CLK-CYC-VP16 complex drives increased per transcription, leading to more rapid accumulation of PER and a consequent advanced phase of per repression.
Researchers have discovered that the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer new traits in a species can be controlled by ancestral genes. They studied the pmrD gene, which is acquired through horizontal transfer, and its interaction with the PmrA/PmrB two-component system in Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli. In Salmonella, the pmrD gene product activates the PmrA/PmrB system, leading to the transcription of genes that confer resistance to polymyxin B. However, in E. coli, the pmrD gene is highly divergent and cannot activate the PmrA/PmrB system.

The researchers found that the E. coli PmrB protein has higher phosphatase activity than its Salmonella homolog, which means it can dephosphorylate and inactivate the PmrA protein more quickly. This difference in phosphatase activity prevents the pmrD gene from activating the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli. By replacing the E. coli pmrB gene with the Salmonella homolog, the researchers were able to restore the ability of the pmrD gene to activate the PmrA/PmrB system in E. coli, leading to resistance to polymyxin B.

These findings suggest that the ability of a horizontally acquired gene to confer new traits in a species can be controlled by quantitative differences in the biochemical activities of ancestral proteins. The study provides a unique example of how horizontal gene transfer can potentiate selection at ancestral loci.
Researchers have developed a new method called the Differentiation-Test to identify genes involved in the early stages of cell differentiation. This process occurs when a less specialized cell becomes a more specialized cell type. The test analyzes gene expression data from a mixture of differentiating cells, allowing for the detection of genes that promote or inhibit differentiation. Unlike previous methods, the Differentiation-Test does not require separating the cells into different types, making it a more efficient approach.

The researchers applied the Differentiation-Test to mouse embryonic stem cells and identified a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal called Smarcad1. They used short hairpin RNA to further study Smarcad1 and another regulator, Pias2, and found that they play a role in the early stages of differentiation. The researchers also identified two modules of genes: one that is upregulated during differentiation and another that is downregulated, indicating a loss of pluripotency.

The Differentiation-Test assumes that the initial cell mixture is relatively homogeneous and that the differentiation process progresses into a more heterogeneous mixture with identifiable gene expression changes. This approach allows for the detection of critical regulators of pluripotency and self-renewal, which are essential for understanding the complex process of cell differentiation. The researchers formalized the Differentiation-Test as a statistical method that can be applied to other differentiation processes, providing a valuable tool for the scientific community.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify functional associations between genes that are mutated in the same disease. This method, called the phenotypic-linkage network, uses a combination of data types, including protein-protein interactions and gene co-expression networks, to examine the relationships between genes. The researchers found that genes mutated in the same disease tend to cluster together more significantly in the phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. However, they also discovered a confounding bias in coding-sequence length, which can lead to false positive findings in functional studies. To address this bias, the researchers developed a tool that controls for coding-sequence length and uses over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations to identify functional associations between genes. This tool is more powerful than existing methods and can identify functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease, even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this tool by applying it to a polygenic disorder and found that it was able to functionally subcluster the gene variants underlying the disorder. This new method has the potential to improve our understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases and could lead to the development of new treatments.
Mexico implemented an 8% tax on nonessential energy-dense foods and a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) in January 2014 to combat rising obesity and diabetes rates. This study evaluated the impact of the tax on household purchases of taxed and untaxed foods from January 2012 to December 2014 using data from The Nielsen Company's Mexico Consumer Panel Services. The analysis found that the mean volume of purchases of taxed foods decreased by 25 grams per capita per month, or 5.1%, in 2014 compared to what was expected based on pre-tax trends. This decline was not observed in purchases of untaxed foods. Low socioeconomic status (SES) households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected, while medium SES households purchased 5.8% less. High SES households did not show a statistically significant change in purchases. The study also found that lower SES households were more responsive to the tax than middle SES households. The results suggest that the tax had a positive impact on reducing the purchase of nonessential energy-dense foods, particularly among lower SES households. However, the study notes that the impact of the tax on overall energy intake, dietary quality, and food purchase patterns remains to be studied. The findings can inform policymakers in Mexico and other countries considering the implementation of food taxes.
Researchers developed a biophysically plausible model to explain the response properties of collision-sensitive neurons, specifically the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD) neuron in locusts. The model, called "n-ψ", assumes that each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold. By pooling these channels, an approximate power law is obtained, which is a common characteristic of collision-sensitive neurons. The model successfully predicts many response characteristics of the LGMD neuron, including its response to objects approaching on a collision course. The results depend critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway, but are robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The n-ψ model is based on its predecessor model Ψ, which used an exact power law for re-scaling inhibitory input. However, the n-ψ model is more biophysically plausible and does not require an exact power law. The model assumes that the integration process, or pooling, is carried out by the dendritic tree of the LGMD neuron. The preconditions for each channel are the presence of noise, which is uncorrelated across channels, and a response threshold. The n-ψ model provides a possible explanation for the biophysical principles underlying the computations carried out by the LGMD neuron.
Cameroon has made significant progress in controlling Buruli ulcer (BU) since the national control programme (NBUCP) began in 2002. Over 14 years, 3,700 cases were reported, and the detection rate decreased from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic health districts increased from two to 64, and five diagnostic and treatment centers are now operational, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and research and education on BU have gained momentum in the country. However, the reduction in programme resources and activities has led to a decline in performance indicators since 2010.

The NBUCP aims to detect cases early, confirm 70% of clinical cases by PCR, treat all active cases according to standard guidelines, and heal at least 95% of patients without limitation of joint movement. The programme's objectives have evolved over time, adapting to new developments and orientations in the domain. The current goal is to reduce the suffering of the population due to BU, ensuring accessibility to quality health services in endemic areas to reduce morbidity and disability linked to BU in Cameroon.
Researchers investigated how people's confidence in their choices is influenced by the context in which they make those choices. They found that people are more confident in their choices when they are learning to seek gains rather than avoid losses, even when the difficulty and performance are the same in both contexts. This bias is driven by the context-value, a measure of the average expected value of choice options, which is updated dynamically during learning. The researchers used a reinforcement-learning task where participants learned to associate stimuli with outcomes, either gains or losses. They found that participants were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains than when learning to avoid losses, despite equal performance in both contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias is due to the context-value, which is necessary to explain the equal performance in both gain and loss domains. This bias has important implications for learning and decision-making, particularly in volatile environments where the flexibility of individuals' learning strategies differs when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. The study highlights the importance of considering the context in which people make choices and the potential consequences of biases in confidence judgments on learning and decision-making processes.
Alphaviruses, a group of viruses that cause diseases such as chikungunya and dengue fever, have a protein called nsP3 that plays a crucial role in their replication. However, the function of nsP3 was not well understood until now. Researchers have discovered that nsP3 binds to a protein called amphiphysin, which is found in host cells. This binding is mediated by a specific sequence of amino acids in nsP3 called the PIPPPR motif. The interaction between nsP3 and amphiphysin is essential for the replication of alphaviruses, as mutations that disrupt this binding site lead to impaired viral RNA synthesis and reduced virus replication in cell culture and in infected mice.

The researchers found that the PIPPPR motif is conserved across different alphaviruses, including Semliki Forest, Sindbis, and Chikungunya viruses. They also showed that amphiphysin is recruited to the sites of RNA replication in infected cells, and that mutations in the nsP3 SH3 binding motifs lead to reduced virus replication in cell culture and attenuated pathogenicity in infected mice. These findings suggest that the interaction between nsP3 and amphiphysin is a key host-virus interaction that promotes alphavirus replication. The discovery of this interaction provides new insights into the mechanisms of alphavirus replication and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat these diseases.
Researchers in Brazil studied 123 strains of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis, a disease that can lead to disfiguring skin lesions. They used DNA sequencing to identify the types of fungi and found that most of the strains belonged to the family Herpotrichiellaceae. Within this family, the most common fungus was Fonsecaea pedrosoi, which was found in 80% of the strains. Other common fungi included Fonsecaea monophora, Fonsecaea nubica, and Fonsecaea pugnacius.

The researchers also found two new species of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis, which were identified as members of the genera Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora. These fungi were less common, making up only 3% and 1% of the strains, respectively. The study found that the fungi causing chromoblastomycosis in Brazil are polyphyletic, meaning they do not form a single group. Instead, they are spread across three different clades, or groups, within the order Chaetothyriales.

The study's findings suggest that Fonsecaea pedrosoi is the most common cause of chromoblastomycosis in Brazil, particularly in humid tropical climates. The researchers also found that Fonsecaea nubica and Fonsecaea pugnacius are less common causes of the disease, while Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora are rare causes. Overall, the study provides new insights into the diversity of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis in Brazil and highlights the need for further research into the causes and treatment of this disease.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes can dampen the body's natural response to DNA damage caused by infection. This response, known as the DNA damage response (DDR), is a critical mechanism that helps maintain genetic integrity by detecting and repairing DNA lesions. When Listeria monocytogenes infects a host cell, it induces DNA breaks, but surprisingly, the DDR is only moderately activated. The researchers found that the listerial toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) plays a key role in blocking the DDR by degrading a protein called Mre11, which is a sensor of DNA damage. By knocking out or inactivating proteins involved in the DDR, the researchers observed an increase in bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism in controlling infection. This study shows that Listeria monocytogenes subverts the DDR to facilitate its own growth and survival within the host. The findings suggest that the DDR can actually be a negative regulator of bacterial infection, and that dampening this response is critical for a successful Listeria infection. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between bacteria and host cells, and has implications for the development of new therapeutic strategies to combat Listeria infections.
Researchers have identified a protein called BRD4 as a key player in the replication of two common human viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2. These viruses are responsible for a range of diseases, including cold sores and genital herpes. By screening a library of chemicals that regulate gene expression, the researchers found that a compound called JQ1 can enhance the replication of these viruses. JQ1 works by blocking a part of the BRD4 protein called the BD1 domain, which normally helps to regulate the activity of other proteins involved in gene expression. When the BD1 domain is blocked, BRD4 is able to form a complex with other proteins, including CDK9 and RNA polymerase II, that helps to promote the replication of viral genes. This complex is normally involved in regulating the expression of cellular genes, but in the presence of JQ1, it is redirected to viral gene promoters, allowing the viruses to replicate more efficiently. The researchers found that suppressing the expression of BRD4 or inhibiting the activity of CDK9 also impeded the replication of the viruses. This suggests that BRD4 plays a crucial role in the replication of HSV-1 and HSV-2, and that targeting this protein with compounds like JQ1 could potentially be used to develop new treatments for these diseases. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of viral replication and highlights the potential of epigenetic regulation as a target for antiviral therapy.
Researchers studied the oral microbial communities of children in Niger affected by noma, a devastating disease that causes severe facial disfigurement in over 140,000 malnourished children each year. The cause of noma is still unknown, but a combination of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and a weakened immune system is thought to contribute to its development. To better understand the microbial ecology of noma, the researchers analyzed 16S rRNA gene fragments from 60 samples of gingival fluid from 12 healthy children, 12 children with noma, and 12 children with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG), a related periodontal disease. The results showed that noma lesions were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted of Proteobacteria compared to healthy individuals. The microbial communities in noma and ANG lesions were dominated by the same Prevotella intermedia OTU, which was less abundant in healthy sites from the same mouths. Multivariate analysis confirmed that bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were significantly different. Several OTUs in the Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaetales were identified as indicators of noma, suggesting that one or more microbes within these Orders may be associated with the development of noma lesions. The study's findings provide new insights into the microbial ecology of noma and highlight the need for further research on the role of viral and microbial components in the development of the disease.
Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that infects insects, uses a communication system called quorum sensing to adapt to its environment. Quorum sensing helps the bacteria decide whether to form spores or engage in a necrotrophic lifestyle, where they break down the insect's body to survive. Researchers have identified a key player in this process, a protein called NprR, which is regulated by a signaling peptide called NprX. In the presence of NprX, NprR acts as a transcriptional activator, turning on genes that help the bacteria survive in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of NprX, NprR acts as an inhibitor of sporulation, the process of forming spores. This inhibition is achieved by preventing the phosphorylation of a protein called Spo0F, which is necessary for the initiation of sporulation. This dual function of NprR is similar to that of Rap proteins, which also belong to the same protein family. The structure of NprR has been determined, and it shows a flexible structure similar to that of Rap proteins. The researchers propose that the binding of NprX to NprR switches its function from an inhibitor of sporulation to a transcriptional activator, allowing the bacteria to adapt to their environment and ensure their survival and dissemination during infection. This study provides new insights into the complex regulation of sporulation and necrotrophism in Bacillus thuringiensis.
Researchers have developed a new approach to predict the effectiveness of HIV treatment for individual patients. Currently, HIV cannot be cured, but it can be controlled with combination treatment using multiple anti-retroviral drugs. However, each patient has a unique viral genotype, making it challenging to determine the best treatment regimen. To address this issue, scientists have created computational models that use viral genotypic data and clinical phenotypic data to predict an optimal treatment plan. Previous models were based solely on sequence data from viral genotyping and did not consider the chemical similarity of drugs.

The new approach, called proteochemometric modeling, combines chemical and protein target properties in a single bioactivity model. Using a large-scale clinical database of over 300,000 drug-mutant bioactivity data points, the researchers developed models that achieved a prediction error below 0.5 Log Fold Change. When compared to previous models based on sequence data, the proteochemometric models performed better in resistance classification and prediction of Log Fold Change. The models were also able to identify previously unpublished resistance-conferring mutations of HIV Reverse Transcriptase and HIV Protease.

The researchers applied their models to a public HIV resistance database and achieved a correct resistance prediction rate of 84% on the full set, compared to 80% in previous work on a high-quality subset. The models can accurately predict phenotypic resistance based on genotypic data, even for novel mutants and mixtures, and provide an applicability domain to inform users about the reliability of predictions.
A new computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis, based on a self-generated cycle of pseudopod formation, has been developed to explain the complex behavior of cells in chemotaxis. The model, which simulates cell polarization and persistence without external stimuli, accurately predicts various aspects of cell movement and chemotaxis, including the selection of accurate pseudopods in the presence of chemoattractant gradients. The model also predicts the bias of pseudopod position in low chemoattractant gradients and the initiation of lateral pseudopods in high gradients, both of which were confirmed by experiments on Dictyostelium cells. The model's predictive ability was further tested by measuring the angles between successive pseudopods at the front of the cell, which increased in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient, as predicted by the model. The results suggest that the mechanism behind chemotaxis relies on the modification of intrinsic pseudopod behavior rather than the generation of new pseudopods or actin polymerization by chemoattractants. The model's simplicity and robustness to parameter changes emphasize that much of the complex behavior of cells may be an emergent property derived from relatively simple pathways, implying a need for a change in experimental approach to understand chemotaxis.
Fleas can transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes the plague, through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and biofilm-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species, and previous studies have yielded inconsistent results. Researchers investigated how the type of rodent blood used for the infectious blood meal affects EPT. They fed fleas bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, or gerbils and assessed the location and characteristics of the infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pestis one to three days after infection. The study found that fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea pig blood were more likely to regurgitate a portion of the infected blood meal into the esophagus within 24 hours of feeding, a phenomenon called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). This was not observed in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER was associated with the accumulation of a dense mixture of Y. pestis, red blood cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin crystals in the proventriculus. At their next feeding, fleas with PIER were more likely to appear partially blocked, with fresh blood retained in the esophagus. The study suggests that EPT results from the regurgitation of Y. pestis from a partially obstructed flea foregut and that EPT and BDT can sometimes occur simultaneously. The researchers propose that the relative insolubility of the hemoglobin in rat and guinea pig blood may promote regurgitative transmission, which may explain why these rodents are prominent in plague ecology.
Researchers have found that positive correlations between the activity of neurons in the brain can actually improve the accuracy of population codes, rather than hindering them as previously thought. In fact, these correlations can enhance coding performance by astronomical factors, suppressing discrimination errors by many orders of magnitude and increasing the number of stimuli that can be encoded by more than tenfold. This effect does not require unrealistically high correlation values and can occur in populations with just a few dozen neurons. The researchers also found that heterogeneity in population activity, which is common in the brain, can further benefit from these correlations. The key to this improvement lies in a specific pattern of correlation, which can lead to a "lock-in" of response probabilities that eliminates variability in the subspace relevant for stimulus discrimination. This pattern can be achieved by tuning one or several effective parameters, resulting in a limit of perfect coding. The study suggests that this phenomenon, referred to as high-fidelity coding, is a general feature of population coding and can be observed in various approaches.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against cholera, a severe diarrheal disease caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. The vaccine, called OSP:rTTHc, combines the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of the V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain with a fragment of the tetanus toxin heavy chain. This conjugate vaccine was tested in mice to assess its ability to induce an immune response and provide protection against cholera.

The study found that mice immunized with OSP:rTTHc developed antibodies against the OSP component of the vaccine, as well as against the tetanus toxin fragment. These antibodies provided protection against cholera in a mouse survival model, with 55% of vaccinated mice surviving a challenge with the bacteria. The vaccine also induced memory B cell responses, which are important for long-term immunity.

The researchers tested different variations of the vaccine, including different doses, molar ratios of OSP to tetanus toxin fragment, and routes of administration. They found that intradermal administration of the vaccine induced intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses, which are important for mucosal immunity. The study also found that the vaccine was effective in the presence or absence of an adjuvant, a substance that enhances the immune response.

Overall, the results suggest that the OSP:rTTHc vaccine is a promising candidate for preventing cholera, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. The development of an effective cholera conjugate vaccine that induces high-level and long-term immune responses against OSP would be a significant advancement in the fight against this disease.
Researchers conducted a study in Cameroon to investigate the effectiveness of immunochromatographic card tests (ICT) in mapping lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with varying levels of Loa loa and Mansonella perstans endemicity. The study involved 2,190 participants from 42 villages across three regions of the Cameroon rainforest domain. The results showed that ICT positivity was strongly associated with high Loa loa microfilaria (Mf) intensity, with 21 individuals having more than 8,000 Loa loa Mf per milliliter of blood. The study also found a strong positive association between the prevalence of Loa loa and ICT positivity by area, with a rate of 1% or more of positive ICT results found only in areas with a Loa loa Mf prevalence above 15%. In contrast, there was no association between ICT positivity and Mansonella perstans prevalence or Mf density. The study suggests that the main confounding factor for positive ICT test card results is high levels of Loa loa. The findings indicate that Wuchereria bancrofti may be less prevalent in the Central African region where Loa loa is highly endemic than previously assumed, and accurate re-mapping of the region would be useful for shrinking the map of LF distribution.
Researchers have discovered a complex network of modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes in cells infected with the SARS-coronavirus. This network, called a reticulovesicular network, is made up of convoluted membranes, double-membrane vesicles (DMVs), and "vesicle packets" that form when DMVs merge. The researchers used a technique called electron tomography to study the three-dimensional structure of the network at high resolution. They found that the convoluted membranes, which were not previously known to be involved in viral RNA synthesis, were primarily labeled with antibodies that recognize viral replicase subunits. In contrast, the DMVs, which were previously thought to be isolated vesicles, were found to be associated with double-stranded RNA, which is likely the site of viral RNA synthesis. However, the researchers were unable to detect a connection between the DMV interior and the cytosol, raising questions about the mechanism of DMV formation and the actual site of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. The discovery of the reticulovesicular network provides new insights into the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and its interactions with host cells. The network may also play a role in hiding replicating RNA from the host's antiviral defense mechanisms.
Researchers have long believed that suberin, a waxy substance found in plant roots, acts as a barrier to control the movement of water and minerals from the soil into the plant. However, until now, there was no direct genetic evidence to support this theory. A new study in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research, has provided the first direct evidence that suberin plays a critical role in regulating water and mineral ion uptake and transport to the leaves.

The study used a mutant plant called esb1, which has increased levels of suberin in its roots. The researchers found that these plants had reduced daytime transpiration rates, meaning they lost less water through their leaves, and increased water-use efficiency. They also found that the plants accumulated less calcium, manganese, and zinc, but more sodium, sulfur, potassium, arsenic, selenium, and molybdenum in their leaves.

These findings suggest that suberin acts as a barrier to the extracellular transport of water and mineral ions in the roots, controlling the amount of water and minerals that reach the leaves. The study's results also indicate that a significant portion of the radial transport of certain minerals, such as calcium, manganese, and zinc, occurs in the apoplast, a region outside of the plant cells.

The study's findings have implications for the development of drought-resistant crops with improved water-use efficiency. The researchers suggest that increasing suberin levels in roots may be a potential approach to achieving this goal.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms behind the reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. They used a mathematical model to study the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the recovery and reproducibility of the SPR. The model, based on the biochemistry of rhodopsin activation and deactivation, was able to reproduce the SPR in both wild-type and mutant mice with varying numbers of phosphorylation sites.

The study found that the randomness of the sojourn times in each phosphorylated state of rhodopsin contributes to the variability of the SPR, while the randomness of the number of rhodopsin turnoff steps has a negligible effect. This result contradicts the prevailing view that the larger the number of decay steps of rhodopsin, the more stable the photoresponse is. Instead, the study suggests that the diffusion of second messengers acts as a variability suppressor.

The researchers used a stochastic framework to analyze the randomness of each phosphorylation state of rhodopsin and interfaced it with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model was able to track the diffusion of second messengers in the cytoplasm and detect the effects of geometrical changes of the rod outer segment on the photoresponse. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the mechanisms behind the reproducibility of the SPR and the role of rhodopsin deactivation in regulating the photoresponse.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical framework to analyze stochastic reaction networks within cells. These networks are influenced by external factors, such as fluctuations in ribosome copy numbers, which can be difficult to account for in models. The new framework allows for the separation of the network from its dynamic environment, incorporating only the environment's effect on the network into a new model. This is achieved by "marginalizing" the system dynamics with respect to the extrinsic fluctuations.

The resulting decoupled model can be used to perform an uncoupled analysis of a reaction network subject to extrinsic noise. This approach provides a novel analytical tool to study how environmental stochasticity is propagated through coupled reaction networks. The researchers have shown that the total environmental noise can be split into two terms: one that is suppressed and another that quantifies the effective noise sensed by the target network.

The decoupled process can also reduce computational effort in Monte Carlo simulations, especially when the environmental network is costly to simulate. This highlights the framework's potential as a general tool to split stochastic biochemical networks into individual parts that are easier to simulate. The researchers demonstrate the significance of the approach through several case studies. The new framework provides a self-contained stochastic model that summarizes all system behaviors attainable under all possible realizations of the extrinsic fluctuations.
Researchers have developed a new brain-machine interface (BMI) design that uses optimal feedback control modeling and adaptive point process filtering to improve control and adaptation in BMIs. The new design, called adaptive optimal feedback-controlled point process filter (OFC-PPF), incorporates two main components: a point process model of spikes and an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model of the brain's control behavior in the BMI paradigm. The OFC model infers the user's motor intention during closed-loop BMI control, a process called intention estimation, and is used to design an autonomous and dynamic assisted training technique. The point process model allows for neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every spike event and at a faster time-scale than current decoders.

The researchers conducted closed-loop experiments in a non-human primate over tens of days to test the new design. The results showed that the OFC intention estimation improved BMI performance compared to current intention estimation techniques. The OFC-assisted training allowed the subject to consistently achieve proficient control. Spike-event-based adaptation resulted in faster and more consistent performance convergence compared to batch-based methods, and was robust to parameter initialization. The new design also extended control to tasks beyond those used for training. These results have significant implications for the development of clinically-viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers investigated how the retina processes stimuli with varying levels of correlation, such as natural movies and white noise checkerboards. They recorded responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells to these stimuli and found that the cells' responses were more correlated when presented with structured stimuli than with unstructured ones. However, the level of correlation was not as high as predicted by a non-adapting model of neural response.

The study found that the retina reduces redundancies in correlated stimuli but does not completely eliminate them. Instead, the output correlations are reduced to a lower level, similar to those seen in responses to uncorrelated stimuli. This suggests that the retina maintains a moderate level of output correlation across a wide range of correlated stimuli.

The researchers also found that the gain of retinal ganglion cells changes with the "effective contrast" of the stimulus, which is the standard deviation of the input to the nonlinearity in a linear-nonlinear model of ganglion cells. This suggests that the retina adjusts its coding strategy to represent the new stimulus class efficiently.

The study's findings are consistent with previous research on the structure of receptive fields in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex, which differ when probed with natural movies versus random stimuli. Overall, the study provides new insights into how the retina processes correlated stimuli and how it adjusts its coding strategy to represent different types of stimuli.
Researchers have developed a new approach to predict genetic interactions, specifically synthetic lethal (SL) interactions, which occur when a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. This approach, called the Multi-Network and Multi-Classifier (MNMC) framework, improves upon existing methods by using a large number of features from various data sources to characterize the relationships between pairs of genes. These features are independent of known SL interactions, unlike some previous approaches. The MNMC framework uses a non-parametric multi-classifier system to predict SL interactions, enabling the simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that this approach outperformed the current state-of-the-art method, particularly for gene pairs not well-connected to known SL interactions. The MNMC framework was used to derive the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network, which was partially supported by literature. Additionally, it was used to predict SL interactions between all non-essential gene pairs in yeast. This approach is expected to be more effective and robust in uncovering new genetic interactions in yeast and higher organisms, such as mouse and human, where few genetic interactions have been identified.
The BRCA Challenge is a global data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to aggregate and analyze genetic variations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, which are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The project aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk. The BRCA Exchange, a newly created website (www.brcaexchange.org), integrates over 20,000 reported variants in BRCA1 and BRCA2 from public databases, including the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database (LOVD). Approximately 7,250 of these variants have been expertly classified.

The BRCA Challenge has brought together an international team of experts, including clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers, to advance our understanding of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variation. The project has developed an open-access web portal, the BRCA Exchange, which provides a reliable and easily accessible record of variants interpreted for a high-penetrance phenotype. The BRCA Challenge represents an important step in sharing and collaborative annotation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 variants to advance human health globally. By linking molecular variants with electronic patient records, the project aims to build an unbiased prospective knowledge base of cancer predisposition. The BRCA Challenge serves as a demonstration project to bring together clinicians, researchers, data scientists, patients, and advocates to work toward a new model of data sharing and improve clinical care for clinicians, patients, and their families.
Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in over one million deaths annually. To understand how Plasmodium maintains its redox balance and pathogenicity, researchers studied the subcellular localization of antioxidant and redox regulatory proteins in the parasite. They found that two peroxiredoxins and a glyoxalase system are targeted to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid found in Plasmodium. The study also mapped the compartmentation of thioredoxin- and glutaredoxin-like proteins in the parasite. Notably, Plasmodium uses alternative translation initiation (ATI) to target two major antioxidant enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase, to different locations within the cell. This dual localization is likely to occur in other Apicomplexa parasites and may provide new avenues for therapeutic intervention. The study provides the first comprehensive picture of the subcellular compartmentation of cellular redox metabolism in malaria parasites. The apicoplast, a unique organelle found in Plasmodium, plays a crucial role in maintaining the parasite's redox balance and is a potential target for chemotherapeutic agents. The research highlights the importance of understanding the cellular functions and interactions of the redox system in Plasmodium, which could lead to the development of new treatments for malaria.
Researchers studied how a protein called PUMA binds to its partner protein Mcl-1. PUMA is an intrinsically disordered protein, meaning it doesn't have a fixed shape. When it binds to Mcl-1, it folds into a specific shape. The study used computer simulations to understand the role of electrostatic interactions in this binding process. Electrostatic interactions are the attractive and repulsive forces between charged particles.

The simulations showed that electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in the binding of PUMA to Mcl-1. The researchers found that the binding process is accelerated by electrostatic interactions, which are weakened at higher salt concentrations. They also discovered that non-native electrostatic interactions, which are interactions between charged particles that are not part of the native binding interface, are involved in the formation of the initial encounter complex between PUMA and Mcl-1.

The study suggests that these non-native electrostatic interactions are important for describing the binding reactions of intrinsically disordered proteins like PUMA. The researchers used a structure-based coarse-grained model to simulate the binding process, which was calibrated with experimental data on the helical content and affinity of the PUMA-Mcl-1 complex. The study provides new insights into the binding mechanism of PUMA and Mcl-1, and highlights the potential importance of non-native electrostatic interactions in protein binding reactions.
Researchers have studied the behavior of Polycomb group (PcG) proteins, which play a crucial role in silencing genes during development. These proteins form structures called Polycomb bodies in the nucleus, which contain silenced genes. The study used a combination of techniques, including immunostaining and live imaging, to analyze the formation and movement of Polycomb bodies in fruit fly embryos. The results show that Polycomb bodies form on specific regions of the genome, called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs), and that they move in a coordinated manner with the surrounding chromatin. Two types of motion were observed: long-range movements that may correspond to the movement of entire chromosome territories, and fast, constrained movements within smaller volumes. The study found that the motion of Polycomb bodies decreases in later developmental stages, suggesting that chromatin dynamics play a role in maintaining stable gene silencing. The researchers also found that the motion of Polycomb bodies is less sensitive to temperature changes than chromatin domains, which may be an important factor in maintaining the stability of gene silencing during development. Overall, the study provides new insights into the behavior of Polycomb proteins and their role in regulating gene expression during development.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the livers of mice that age normally and those that age prematurely due to a genetic mutation. The study found that mice with a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase had 10 times more point mutations in their mtDNA than their normal counterparts. These mice also had high levels of linear mtDNA molecules with deletions, but low levels of circular mtDNA molecules with deletions, which have been suggested to contribute to aging. The study suggests that these linear deletions may not be the primary cause of premature aging in these mice. The researchers also found that the majority of mtDNA mutations in these mice were inherited from their mothers, indicating that they occur during development rather than as a result of damage accumulation in adult life. In contrast, normal mice showed no increase in mtDNA mutations with age, casting doubt on the idea that these changes contribute to aging. The study's findings argue against oxidative damage as a major cause of mtDNA mutations and suggest that most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development rather than as a result of damage accumulation in adult life. Overall, the study provides new insights into the origins of mtDNA mutations and their role in aging.
Researchers have discovered a new type of ATP synthase enzyme in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum that uses sodium ions (Na+) to generate energy for the cell. This enzyme, called F1Fo-ATP synthase, is different from other ATP synthases that use protons (H+) to produce energy. The researchers found that the Na+-binding site in the enzyme's c-ring is unique, with two carboxylate groups instead of one, which allows it to bind Na+ ions. This new type of Na+-binding site is also found in other human pathogens, making it a potential target for new treatments.

The researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the c-ring and found that Na+ ions occupy all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water molecule. They also used molecular modeling and free-energy simulations to confirm that the enzyme is specific to Na+ ions in physiological settings. Experiments showed that the enzyme is stimulated by Na+ ions and that ATP synthesis is sensitive to the Na+ ionophore monensin. Additionally, the researchers found that Na+ ions have a protective effect against inhibitors targeting the ion-binding sites.

The discovery of this new type of Na+-binding site in the c-ring of the F1Fo-ATP synthase from F. nucleatum provides new insights into the mechanism of ion transport and the specificity of the enzyme. This finding has implications for the development of new treatments against opportunistic pathogens that use this type of ATP synthase.
Researchers studied how T cells, a type of immune cell, respond to foreign substances in the body. They used peptides, short chains of amino acids, that bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on the surface of immune cells called antigen-presenting cells (APCs). The peptides were designed to interact with T cell receptors (TCRs) in different ways, with varying levels of strength and duration. The goal was to understand how these interactions affect T cell activation and the body's immune response.

The study found that T cells responded best to peptides with intermediate levels of interaction with TCRs, rather than those with the strongest or weakest interactions. This was unexpected, as previous studies suggested that stronger interactions would lead to more effective immune responses. The researchers also observed that T cells exposed to the strongest peptide ligand showed reduced activation, expansion, and function over time.

These findings suggest that the way T cells interact with foreign substances in the body is more complex than previously thought. The study highlights the importance of considering how T cells respond in the body, rather than just in laboratory settings, when designing vaccines or treatments. The results may lead to a reevaluation of strategies that aim to elicit strong T cell responses using engineered peptide ligands.
The genome of the fungus Nectria haematococca, also known as Fusarium solani, has been extensively studied. This fungus is part of a group of over 50 species known as the Fusarium solani species complex, which can cause disease in plants and opportunistic infections in humans. Researchers analyzed the genome of N. haematococca mating population VI (MPVI) and found that it has 17 chromosomes, ranging in size from 530 kilobases to 6.52 megabases. The physical size of the genome is 54.43 megabases, making it one of the largest reported for ascomycetes, a group of fungi. The number of predicted genes, 15,707, is also among the highest for ascomycetes.

Two classes of genes have contributed to the expansion of the N. haematococca genome. Some genes are unique to this species and are not found in its closest relative, Fusarium graminearum. Others are found in other fungi but are present in multiple copies in N. haematococca MPVI. Some of these additional genes may have resulted from gene duplication events, while others may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. Three supernumerary chromosomes, 14, 15, and 17, were found to be absent in some isolates and lacked chromosome-specific sequences. These supernumerary chromosomes contain more repeat sequences, unique and duplicated genes, and have a lower G+C content compared to other chromosomes. The origin of the extra genes and supernumerary chromosomes is unknown, but the gene expansion and large genome size are consistent with the species' diverse range of habitats.
Researchers used live-cell fluorescence microscopy to study how alpha herpesviruses, such as pseudorabies virus (PRV), exit infected cells. They developed a method to visualize the final steps of PRV particle transport and exocytosis in non-polarized epithelial cells. The study used total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy to selectively image fluorescent virus particles near the plasma membrane and a pH-sensitive probe to visualize the moment and location of particle exocytosis.

The researchers found that individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside small, acidified secretory vesicles. These vesicles are regulated by Rab GTPases, which are key regulators of the plasma membrane-directed secretory pathway. The vesicles undergo fast, directional transport directly to the site of exocytosis, which is often near patches of LL5β, a complex that anchors microtubules to the plasma membrane. The vesicles are tightly docked at the site of exocytosis for several seconds before membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a small distance across the plasma membrane.

After exocytosis, particles remain tightly confined on the outer cell surface. The study proposes an integrated model that links together the intracellular transport pathways and exocytosis mechanisms that mediate alpha herpesvirus egress. This research contradicts an earlier study that suggested a different mechanism of viral egress and provides new insights into the dynamics and molecular mechanisms of alpha herpesvirus egress.
A recent study investigated the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on the intestinal microbiota and host immune response in 109 primary school children. The researchers found that pinworm infection was associated with increased intestinal bacterial diversity, which peaked after administration of mebendazole. At the phylum level, pinworm infection and mebendazole treatment were linked to a decrease in Fusobacteria and an increase in Actinobacteria. Specifically, the relative abundance of the probiotic Bifidobacterium increased after enterobiasis and mebendazole treatment.

The study also showed that the intestinal secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) level was lower in the pinworm-infected group, but was elevated in half of the individuals after mebendazole deworming treatment. However, a higher proportion of pre-treatment Salmonella spp. was associated with a non-increase in SIgA after mebendazole treatment. The findings suggest that childhood exposure to pinworm and mebendazole is associated with increased bacterial diversity, an increased abundance of Actinobacteria, and a decreased proportion of Fusobacteria. The study highlights the complex interactions between pinworm infection, intestinal microbiota, and host immune responses, and emphasizes the need for further research to fully understand these relationships.
Researchers studied the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research. They found that most of the genetic variation in root length was not due to individual genetic differences, but rather to how different genes interacted with each other. This type of genetic interaction is called epistasis. The researchers used a statistical approach to identify pairs of genes that interacted to affect root length. They found four pairs of genes that interacted in this way, involving seven different locations on the plant's chromosomes. These interactions cancelled out the individual effects of the genes, making it difficult to detect them using standard genetic analysis methods. The researchers used a new statistical approach to estimate the likelihood that these interactions were real, and found that at least half of them were likely to be true. They then tested the function of the genes involved in these interactions and found that four of them affected root development. This study highlights the importance of considering how genes interact with each other when studying complex traits like root length. It also shows that standard genetic analysis methods may not be enough to identify the genetic factors contributing to these traits.
Researchers analyzed 30,506 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from around the world to understand how background mtDNA haplogroups influence the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mtDNA mutations. They found that the mean pathogenicity score for known disease-causing mutations was significantly different between mtDNA macro-haplogroups. This suggests that the background mtDNA haplogroup plays a role in the likelihood of acquiring or retaining a disease-causing mutation. The study also showed that disease-causing mutations were more frequent on young sequences and that genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected by chance. This implies that mtDNA background has been purified through natural selection in older populations, leading to the low frequency of mtDNA disease reported in specific ethnic groups. The researchers found that some disease-causing mutations were observed across all haplogroup backgrounds, while others were only seen on specific clades. In some cases, this was due to a founder effect, but in others, the mutation recurred within the same phylogenetic cluster. The study suggests that the mtDNA background is more generally involved in recurrent mutation events that have been purified through natural selection in older populations.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study how cells interact with each other when migrating in a coordinated manner, a process known as collective motility. This phenomenon is crucial in various biological processes, including cancer metastasis, embryonic development, and wound healing. To understand these interactions, scientists often use micropatterned substrates that restrict cell migration to linear paths, allowing for controlled collisions between cells.

The model, which incorporates the mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), was able to reproduce all possible outcomes of two-cell collisions, including cells reversing direction, sticking together, or passing each other. The study found that a delicate balance between internal cell polarization, CIL, and cell-cell adhesion determines the outcome of these collisions.

The researchers identified key parameters that control the transitions between different collision outcomes, including cell-cell adhesion, propulsion strength, and the rates of CIL. These findings suggest hypotheses for why different cell types exhibit distinct collision behaviors and how interventions can modulate these outcomes. However, the study also highlights the importance of considering cell-to-cell variation in key parameters, such as cell-cell adhesion, to accurately reproduce the heterogeneity observed in experimental data.

The model's ability to capture the complexity of cell-cell interactions provides new insights into collective cell migration, which is essential for various biological functions, including the immune system, embryonic development, and cancer invasion.
Scientists have been trying to understand how a protein called thioredoxin (Trx) breaks down its mixed disulfide complex with another protein, arsenate reductase (ArsC), for over 20 years. A mixed disulfide is a type of chemical bond that forms between two cysteine amino acids in proteins. In this study, researchers used a combination of theoretical analysis, computer simulations, and biochemical experiments to investigate how Trx breaks down its mixed disulfide with ArsC. They found that a specific cysteine residue in Trx, called Cys32, plays a crucial role in breaking down the mixed disulfide. Cys32 forms a hydrogen bond with another cysteine residue in Trx, Cys29, which helps to activate it as a nucleophile. This allows Cys32 to attack and break the mixed disulfide bond between Cys29 and ArsC. The researchers found that Cys32 is more reactive than another cysteine residue in ArsC, Cys82, and that it directs its attack on Cys29 rather than Cys89 in ArsC. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of thiol/disulfide exchange reactions, which are important for many cellular processes. The findings suggest that the activation of Cys32 as a nucleophile is key to breaking down the mixed disulfide complex and releasing the reduced substrate and oxidized Trx.
Researchers investigated how people use social information to learn about their own preferences, specifically in the context of inter-temporal preferences, or the tendency to value immediate rewards over future rewards. They found that people's preferences are not fixed personality traits, but rather uncertain beliefs that can be updated based on evidence, such as the preferences of others. In a study of over 700 young people, the researchers tested a model that assumes people are uncertain about their own preferences and update their beliefs based on social information. The results showed that people's choice variability, or the tendency to make different choices in similar situations, reflects their uncertainty about their own preferences. This uncertainty decreases with age, suggesting that people become more confident in their preferences as they get older. The researchers also found that observing others' choices can lead to a shift in one's own preferences, and that this shift is more pronounced in people who are more uncertain about their own preferences. The study suggests that people use Bayesian reasoning to update their beliefs about their own preferences based on social information, and that this process is an important aspect of decision-making. The findings have implications for our understanding of how people make decisions and how social influence can shape our preferences.
Biologists have long sought to understand how different cellular pathways work together to produce a coordinated response to environmental changes. A recent study in budding yeast sheds light on this question by examining the regulation of filamentous growth, a complex differentiation response that occurs under specific conditions. Researchers used a novel screening approach called secretion profiling to measure the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2p, the signaling mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway.

The study found that multiple pathways, including RAS, RIM101, OPI1, and RTG, are required for filamentous growth and converge on the FG pathway. This convergence of signals sensitizes the FG pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizes it with the global signaling network. The researchers also identified the MSB2 promoter as a key "hub" where multiple signals converge, and found that the histone deacetylase Rpd3p positively regulates FG pathway activity and filamentous growth.

The study provides the first glimpse of a global regulatory hierarchy among the pathways that control filamentous growth. The findings suggest that systems-level integration of signaling circuitry is likely to coordinate other regulatory networks that control complex behaviors. The research also highlights the importance of understanding how different pathways work together to produce a coordinated response to environmental changes.
Researchers studied the development of fruiting bodies in five species of filamentous fungi to understand how changes in gene expression contribute to the evolution of different morphologies. They grew the fungi in a controlled environment and measured the expression of thousands of genes at five stages of development. By comparing the gene expression patterns of the different species, the researchers were able to reconstruct the ancestral gene expression phenotypes and identify genes that had increased in expression over time. They then knocked out these genes in two of the species and observed changes in fruiting body development. This approach allowed them to refine a network of genes that control fruiting body development, which is a complex and poorly understood process in multicellular organisms. The study found that many genes involved in fruiting body development have evolved to perform different functions in different species, but some genes retain similar functions across species. The researchers suggest that changes in gene expression are a key driver of morphological innovation in fungi, and that understanding these changes can provide insights into the evolution of complex traits in other organisms. By combining gene expression measurements with knockout phenotypes, the researchers were able to build a more detailed understanding of the relationships among genes involved in fruiting body development and how these relationships have evolved over time.
Researchers have found a way to introduce genetic material into the eggs of a parasitic flatworm called Schistosoma mansoni, which causes schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. They used a technique called electroporation, which involves applying an electric pulse to the egg, to deliver genetic material into the egg. This technique was more effective than simply soaking the egg in the genetic material. The researchers were able to introduce various types of genetic material, including fluorescent RNA, messenger RNA, and viral particles, into the egg. They found that the genetic material was able to penetrate the eggshell and reach the germ cells inside, which are responsible for passing on genetic traits to the next generation. The researchers were able to detect the presence of the genetic material in the eggs and in the larvae that hatched from them. They also found that electroporation was more effective at introducing viral particles into the egg than simply soaking the egg in the particles. This technique has the potential to be used for germ line transgenesis, which is the process of introducing genetic material into the germ cells of an organism in order to study its development and behavior. This could lead to a better understanding of the biology of Schistosoma mansoni and potentially to the development of new treatments for schistosomiasis.
Researchers have developed a new approach called the Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PMT) model to study the dynamic properties of large macromolecular assemblies. These assemblies are crucial for various biological processes in cells, and understanding how they respond to signals is essential for understanding cellular signaling. The PMT model involves probing the assembly with an initial perturbation, which is transmitted through the connected network of atoms and residues. This allows researchers to monitor the time-dependent responses of all residues simultaneously, from the moment of perturbation until equilibrium is reached.

The PMT model can identify key residues involved in macromolecular movement, signal mediation, and binding interactions. By analyzing the GroEL-GroES chaperone system, the researchers found that their predictions were accurate 71-84% of the time when compared to independent experimental studies. This approach can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries, such as virus capsids and ribosomal complexes. The PMT model is particularly effective for large assemblies, requiring relatively small amounts of computational time. It can also be modified to study signal transmission pathways by applying initial perturbations to specific local regions, such as binding surfaces. Overall, the PMT model provides a powerful tool for understanding the dynamic behavior of large macromolecular assemblies and their role in cellular signaling.
Researchers have discovered that a type of carbohydrate-binding protein called galectin, found in fungi, can be toxic to a specific type of worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. The galectin, called CGL2, was isolated from the mushroom Coprinopsis cinerea and was shown to inhibit the worm's development and reproduction, ultimately leading to its death. The researchers found that the toxicity of CGL2 depends on its interaction with a specific type of sugar molecule attached to the worm's cells. This sugar molecule, called a glycoconjugate, contains a fucose sugar attached to a galactose sugar in a specific arrangement. The researchers identified this glycoconjugate as a key component of the worm's N-glycan core, a type of sugar molecule found on the surface of cells. They also found that a specific gene, M03F8.4, is involved in the production of this glycoconjugate. The researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the complex between CGL2 and the glycoconjugate, revealing how the galectin binds to the sugar molecule. These findings suggest that fungal galectins like CGL2 may play a role in defending fungi against predators, such as nematodes, by binding to specific sugar molecules on their surfaces.
Researchers have investigated how the presence of a latent reservoir of HIV-infected cells affects the evolution of the virus within an individual and at the population level. They found that the latent reservoir can cause a significant delay in the within-host evolutionary process, allowing the virus to evolve intermediate levels of virulence that optimize transmission at the population level. This delay is influenced by the size of the reservoir and the rate of cell proliferation within it.

The study used a mathematical model to simulate the evolution of HIV within a single host and at the population level. The results showed that the presence of a latent reservoir can fundamentally change the dynamics of the virus, leading to the evolution of intermediate viral loads that are consistent with maximizing transmission. This is in contrast to previous models that predicted very high viral loads.

The researchers also found that the delay in within-host evolutionary dynamics can be sufficient to explain the unexpectedly high heritability of HIV set-point viral load despite considerable within-host evolution between transmission events. The study suggests that the latent reservoir plays a crucial role in determining the within-host evolutionary rate and the outcome of population-level evolution of virulence. Overall, the findings highlight the importance of considering the latent reservoir in understanding the evolution of HIV.
Researchers studied how the virus coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) interacts with the immune system, specifically how it affects the presentation of antigens to T cells. Antigens are substances that trigger an immune response, and T cells are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. The study found that CVB3 almost completely inhibits the presentation of antigens to CD8+ T cells, which are a type of T cell that helps to kill infected cells. This inhibition is due to the virus's ability to block the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway, a process by which antigens are presented to CD8+ T cells.

In contrast, the presentation of antigens to CD4+ T cells, another type of T cell, is relatively unaffected by CVB3. CD4+ T cells help to coordinate the immune response and activate other immune cells. The study found that CVB3 induces a normal immune response in CD4+ T cells, with these cells displaying an effector phenotype and producing cytokines, which are signaling molecules that help to coordinate the immune response. The researchers also found that CVB3-specific CD4+ T cells expand and differentiate into memory cells, which can provide long-term protection against future infections.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how CVB3 infection affects the immune system and how the virus evades the immune response. The results suggest that CVB3's ability to inhibit MHC class I antigen presentation is a key factor in its ability to evade CD8+ T cell immunity.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the effectiveness of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (MP) in treating leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Leprosy Type 1 reactions can cause nerve damage and disability, and corticosteroids are commonly used to treat the condition. However, the optimal dose and duration of treatment are not well established. The study involved 42 participants who were randomly assigned to receive either high-dose intravenous MP followed by oral prednisolone or oral prednisolone alone. The results showed that there were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or clinical improvement between the two groups. However, individuals who received MP were less likely to experience a decline in sensory function compared to those who received prednisolone alone.

The study also found that 50% of participants required additional prednisolone despite receiving a 16-week course of corticosteroids. This suggests that longer courses of corticosteroid treatment may be necessary to manage leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. The study's findings support the use of prolonged corticosteroid treatment and highlight the need to investigate risk factors for the recurrence of Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment during and after treatment.
Researchers investigated how regulatory T cells (Treg) affect CD8+ T cell responses in people with chronic HIV infection. They found that Treg from HIV-infected individuals (Treg/HIV+) did not suppress CD8+ T cell function as effectively as Treg from HIV-negative individuals (Treg/HIV-). Specifically, Treg/HIV+ did not inhibit the activity of CD8+ T cells responding to HIV-specific antigens, but did suppress the activity of CD8+ T cells responding to other antigens, such as CMV, EBV, and flu. The researchers also found that Treg/HIV+ did not affect the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8+ T cells, which are markers of T cell exhaustion. In contrast, Treg/HIV- suppressed the expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 on CD8+ T cells responding to other antigens. The study suggests that Treg/HIV+ are defective in modulating HIV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, which may contribute to the exhaustion of these cells and the failure to control HIV infection. The results also indicate that HIV-specific CD8+ T cells are less sensitive to Treg-mediated suppression than CD8+ T cells responding to other antigens. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex interactions between Treg and CD8+ T cells in chronic HIV infection.
Researchers investigated the potential of a protein called glutathione-S-transferase (GST) from the Wuchereria bancrofti parasite as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. Lymphatic filariasis is a parasitic disease that affects millions of people worldwide, causing severe swelling and damage to the lymphatic system. The study found that individuals living in areas where the disease is common have antibodies against the WbGST protein, which suggests that the protein may be a good target for a vaccine.

The researchers cloned the WbGST gene from the parasite and expressed it in the lab, creating a recombinant version of the protein (rWbGST). They then tested the ability of antibodies from individuals living in endemic areas to neutralize the enzymatic activity of rWbGST. The results showed that these antibodies could indeed neutralize the enzyme activity, which is critical for the parasite's survival in the host.

The researchers also tested the vaccine potential of rWbGST in a jird model, a small mammal commonly used in scientific research. The results showed that approximately 61% of the jirds immunized with rWbGST were protected against a challenge infection with the Brugia malayi parasite, which is closely related to Wuchereria bancrofti. These findings suggest that rWbGST may be a promising vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis.
Researchers used a new approach to investigate potential off-target effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing tool in mice. They sequenced the genomes of 8 parents and 19 embryos, including 10 that had been edited with CRISPR-Cas9 to target a specific gene. The study aimed to determine if CRISPR-Cas9 was causing unintended mutations in the edited embryos. The researchers found that if CRISPR-Cas9 were causing off-target mutations, the number of these mutations would be statistically indistinguishable from the background rate of mutations that occur naturally. This suggests that CRISPR-Cas9 may not be causing significant off-target effects under the conditions used in this study. The study's findings support the development of CRISPR-Cas9 as a therapeutic tool. The researchers also addressed a limitation of previous studies, which used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish between generational or colony-related differences and true off-target effects. By using a trio design, where parents and offspring are sequenced together, the researchers were able to more accurately assess the impact of CRISPR-Cas9 on the genome.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), that play a crucial role in regulating the opening and closing of stomatal pores on plant leaves. These pores control the exchange of carbon dioxide and water between the plant and its environment, affecting photosynthesis, water use efficiency, and crop yields. The study found that HRB1 and PP7 interact with each other and work together to regulate stomatal aperture in response to blue light. Mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 disrupt this process, leading to misregulation of stomatal aperture and increased water loss.

The researchers discovered that HRB1 is phosphorylated in the dark and dephosphorylated in the light, and that PP7 is responsible for this dephosphorylation. They also found that HRB1 and PP7 co-localize in the nucleus of guard cells, the cells responsible for regulating stomatal aperture. The study suggests that the modification of HRB1 by PP7 under blue light is essential for the proper functioning of the stomatal opening response.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex signaling pathways that control stomatal aperture and may lead to the development of strategies to improve crop yields and water use efficiency in plants. This could be particularly important for crops grown under water-limiting conditions.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called MDT-15 plays a crucial role in how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans adapts to the food it ingests. MDT-15 is a subunit of the Mediator complex, a group of proteins that help regulate gene expression. The study found that MDT-15 is involved in the expression of genes related to detoxification and metabolism, particularly in response to toxins and heavy metals. When MDT-15 is depleted or mutated, the worms become more sensitive to toxins and are unable to properly respond to certain environmental stressors. However, MDT-15 does not affect other types of stress responses, such as thermotolerance. The researchers propose that MDT-15 integrates multiple transcriptional regulatory pathways to monitor the quality and availability of ingested materials, including nutrients and toxins. This suggests that MDT-15 plays a key role in maintaining the worm's health and longevity. The study also found that MDT-15 targets genes involved in energy metabolism and detoxification, which are linked to the worm's life span. The researchers speculate that MDT-15 is part of a regulatory system that coordinates systemic adaptation to ingestion-related stress, ensuring the worm's overall health and longevity.
Researchers investigated how the brain's hippocampus creates a mental map of an animal's environment. They proposed that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information. Using computer simulations of rat trajectories in different environments, they found that patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic length of time. A computational algorithm based on algebraic topology was used to analyze the data. The study revealed a "learning region" where the interplay between firing rate, place field size, and number of neurons affects the ability to form a map. Within this region, adjustments in one parameter can compensate for changes in another, but beyond a certain point, map formation fails. The researchers propose that this learning region provides a theoretical framework for understanding conditions that impair spatial learning. They suggest that the hippocampus creates a topological map derived from place cell co-firing patterns, which can be reconstructed from the pattern of overlaps between place fields. This study provides new insights into how the brain encodes spatial information and has implications for understanding conditions that affect spatial learning.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding how the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is secreted from infected cells. The current model of HCV production involves the assembly of virions on or near lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements for and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion were incomplete. To address this, researchers combined RNA interference (RNAi) analysis of host factors for infectious HCV secretion with live cell imaging of HCV core trafficking. The RNAi studies identified multiple components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid and protein kinases that regulate budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP1 vesicles and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. These findings support a model where HCV is infectious upon envelopment at the ER and exits the cell via the secretory pathway. The researchers also developed a live cell imaging approach to study HCV core trafficking using an infectious HCV with a tetracysteine (TC) tag insertion in the core protein. The results show that HCV core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and localizes to the Golgi and recycling endosome. The majority of dynamic core traffics in association with apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and VAMP1 vesicles. This study identifies many new host cofactors of HCV egress and presents dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells.
Researchers have identified a link between the loss of a specific gene, Grb10, and the development of tumors in mice with a genetic mutation that predisposes them to cancer. Grb10 is an imprinted gene, meaning it is expressed from only one parental allele, and its loss can have a significant impact on tumor growth. In mice with a mutation in the Neurofibromatosis I (NF1) gene, which is a tumor suppressor gene, the loss of Grb10 was found to promote tumor formation. The researchers found that Grb10 acts as a negative regulator of the Ras signaling pathway, which is involved in cell growth and division. When Grb10 is lost, the Ras pathway becomes hyperactivated, leading to increased cell proliferation and tumor growth. Restoring Grb10 in tumors decreased proliferation and downregulated the Ras signaling pathway, while silencing Grb10 in normal cells increased cell proliferation and activated the Ras pathway. The study suggests that Grb10 loss can occur during tumorigenesis and independently promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation, which is an early feature of tumor development. The findings have implications for understanding the role of imprinted genes in cancer and suggest that mutations in imprinted genes, such as Grb10, should be considered in the context of parental origin.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues through Pavlovian fear conditioning. They used a statistical framework to analyze autonomic nervous system (ANS) responses, such as skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PSR), in three experiments. The team compared different computational models of learning, including non-probabilistic, simple probabilistic, and non-learning models, to see which one best explained ANS responses.

The results showed that a probabilistic learning model, which assumes a Bayesian agent that represents threat predictions probabilistically, best explained ANS responses. This model suggests that humans use probabilistic inference to form and maintain Pavlovian threat predictions, including estimating uncertainty. SCR and PSR responses reflected different quantities of the same model, with SCR tracking a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty, and PSR tracking expected outcome alone.

The study provides systematic evidence that Pavlovian threat learning in humans relies on probabilistic inference and includes estimation of uncertainty. This finding could inform theories of neural implementation of aversive learning and has implications for understanding how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues. The study's use of a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling allowed for precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses, providing a more detailed understanding of the learning process.
Researchers have identified a protein called PomA in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans that plays a crucial role in regulating asexual reproduction. PomA acts as a suppressor of another protein called SepH, which is involved in the septation initiation network (SIN). The SIN is essential for cell division and asexual reproduction in fungi. The study found that PomA and SepH work together to regulate the phosphorylation of a protein called HogA, which is part of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK pathway helps the fungus respond to stress and environmental changes.

Under normal conditions, SepH promotes the phosphorylation of HogA, while PomA has the opposite effect. However, when the fungus is under osmotic stress, the phosphorylation of HogA can bypass the need for SepH. This suggests that there is a connection between the SIN and MAPK pathways. The researchers found that PomA and SepH indirectly regulate HogA phosphorylation by affecting the upstream kinases that activate HogA.

The study also showed that the absence of PomA can cure defects in septation and conidiation caused by a mutation in SepH. Conversely, overexpressing PomA can abolish septation and conidiation. These findings suggest that PomA and SepH play a key role in regulating the phosphorylation of HogA, which is essential for septation and conidiation. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between the SIN and MAPK pathways in fungal reproduction.
A recent study investigated the relationship between the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 (LRV1) and the severity of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in patients in Brazil. Tegumentary leishmaniasis is a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania, which can lead to various clinical manifestations, including cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), mucosal leishmaniasis (ML), and diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). The study analyzed 156 patients with TL and found that LRV1 was present in 71.1% of patients with mucosal lesions and 36.7% of patients with cutaneous lesions. The presence of LRV1 was significantly associated with the development of mucosal leishmaniasis, with a 2.93-fold increased risk compared to patients without LRV1. The study also identified five different Leishmania species, with Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis being the most common. The results suggest that LRV1 is an important factor in the development of mucosal leishmaniasis, but it is not the only factor contributing to the disease outcome. The study provides new evidence on the relationship between LRV1 and the different species of Leishmania with the clinical manifestations of TL.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumococcal invasive disease by inhibiting the transmigration of bacteria from the lung to the blood. Researchers found that mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar1−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody against the type I interferon receptor exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection. In contrast, treatment with IFNβ or IFN-I-inducing synthetic double-stranded RNA (poly(I:C)) reduced the development of bacteremia. The study suggests that IFN-I regulates two mechanisms involved in pneumococcal invasion: platelet-activating factor receptor (PAF receptor)-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration. IFN-I upregulates tight junction proteins and downregulates PAF receptor expression, which reduces bacterial invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers. The findings indicate that IFN-I is an important component of the host immune defense against pneumococcal infection, limiting the progression from a site-restricted lung infection to invasive, lethal disease.
Researchers developed a neural network with multiple layers of plastic connections to learn a complex foraging task. The network used a type of synaptic plasticity called spike time dependent plasticity (STDP), which allows connections between neurons to strengthen or weaken based on the timing of their activity. The network consisted of three layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The hidden layer used non-rewarded STDP to learn patterns in the input data, while the output layer used rewarded STDP to make decisions based on the patterns learned by the hidden layer.

The researchers found that the network was able to learn and perform a complex foraging task, involving pattern classification and decision making, without labeled training data. The addition of a hidden layer with non-rewarded STDP allowed the network to respond to specific combinations of inputs, enabling basic classification of input patterns. When combined with a layer using rewarded STDP, the network was able to learn to distinguish between rewarding and punishing patterns.

The network's ability to learn from trial and error, through synaptic noise, allowed it to identify effective goal-oriented strategies for solving the task. The study suggests that a network with multiple layers of plastic connections, using both rewarded and non-rewarded STDP, is capable of solving complex tasks involving pattern recognition and decision making.
Researchers have found that the ETS transcription factor ELF5 plays a key role in driving lung metastasis in luminal breast cancer. In a study using a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, the team discovered that increased levels of ELF5 led to the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) to the tumor. These cells, which are immature neutrophils, promote vasculogenesis and metastasis. Depletion of MDSCs prevented ELF5 from driving metastasis, suggesting that ELF5 co-opts the innate immune system to facilitate the spread of cancer cells to the lungs.

The study also found that ELF5 expression is associated with increased inflammation and myeloid cell invasion in luminal A breast cancers. High levels of ELF5 were linked to shorter metastasis-free and overall survival in patients with luminal A breast cancer. The researchers used an inducible mouse model to investigate the role of ELF5 in mammary carcinogenesis and progression to metastatic disease. They found that ELF5 promotes a supportive environment for metastatic cells in the lungs, characterized by the absence of cellular stress, necrosis, and innate immune system recruitment.

These findings suggest that ELF5 is a key determinant of the lethal phenotype in luminal A breast cancer. The study's results are consistent with previous observations in human breast cancer cells and indicate that ELF5's effects are coupled with the immune system in both the mouse model and human breast cancer. The researchers propose that the previously described role of ELF5 in the progression to antiestrogen insensitivity in luminal breast cancer may lead to metastasis through the attraction of the innate immune system.
Recent experiments have shown that the interaction between chromatin loops plays a significant role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Chromatin loops are characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication form. However, the impact of these factors on gene expression variability is not fully understood. To address this issue, researchers developed a stochastic model that maps connection patterns between interacting DNA loops into a multistate model of gene expression.

The model shows that the connection pattern between loops affects gene expression, with nested loops enhancing mRNA expression and reducing expression noise, while alternating loops have the opposite effect. The study also compared the effects of facilitated tracking and direct looping on gene expression, finding that facilitated tracking performs better in controlling mean expression and tuning expression noise. However, this control is distance-dependent, and there is a limit to loop length beyond which the difference in effect between the two communication forms disappears.

The analysis and results support the facilitated chromatin-looping hypothesis. The study highlights the importance of considering the interaction between chromatin loops in understanding cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. The model provides a systematic approach to understanding how changes in loop connection patterns, distance, and communication form affect gene expression variability. The findings have implications for understanding the complex biochemical interactions that lead to stochastic gene transcription and cell-to-cell variability in gene expression.
Researchers have developed a new approach to create "pure" riboregulators, which are RNA molecules that can control gene expression without the need for a separate protein. These riboregulators work by blocking translation initiation, the process by which cells convert RNA into protein. The new approach uses a design of experiments (DOE) to explore the features of riboregulators and identify which ones are most effective at repressing gene expression. The researchers analyzed 12 structural and thermodynamic features of riboregulators and identified six key features that are important for their function. They then used these features to design and construct 18 new riboregulators, which were tested for their ability to repress gene expression. The results showed that the riboregulators were able to repress gene expression to levels as low as 6% of the original level. The researchers used a statistical model to link the features of the riboregulators to their function, and found that both structural and thermodynamic features were important for efficient gene repression. This new approach enables the reliable design of effective riboregulators, which can be used to control gene expression in a variety of applications, including metabolic engineering. The development of pure riboregulators has the potential to reduce the metabolic burden on cells and improve the efficiency of gene expression modulation.
Researchers have discovered a new way that neurons in the brain communicate with each other, called coherence potentials. These events occur when a group of neurons in the cortex, the outer layer of the brain, work together and their activity exceeds a certain threshold. When this happens, the activity pattern of the group is transmitted to other parts of the cortex without losing any information, similar to how action potentials work at the single-cell level. However, unlike action potentials, coherence potentials can have different waveforms, which allows them to carry more information and identify specific associations between neurons.

The study used recordings of local field potential activity in awake monkeys and organotypic cultures of cortex to observe these events. The researchers found that coherence potentials can extend for hundreds of milliseconds and preserve the temporal characteristics of the underlying neuronal activity. This is consistent with the idea that coherence potential propagation represents the transfer of meaningful information in the cortical network.

The study also found that the temporal properties of the LFP waveform are often better predictors of behaviors than individual spikes, suggesting that coherence potential propagation is an important mechanism for information transfer in the brain. The researchers looked for evidence of a preservation of the underlying pattern of spike activity associated with coherence potential propagation and found that the LFP recordings represent the aggregate activity of several hundred neurons, but only a small number of units close to the electrode can be resolved.
Scientists have long known that the size of a cell's nucleus is closely linked to the size of the cell itself, but the exact mechanisms behind this relationship have remained unclear. To shed light on this process, researchers conducted a genetic screen in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe to identify essential factors involved in controlling nuclear size. The study found 25 genes that, when deleted, significantly altered the size of the nucleus. Analysis of these genes revealed that RNA processing and LINC complexes, which connect the nucleus to the cytoplasm, play a crucial role in regulating nuclear size.

The researchers used fission yeast because of its genetic tractability and simple cell shape, making it an ideal model organism for studying nuclear size control. They found that the ratio of nuclear volume to cell volume remained constant across a wide range of cell sizes, suggesting that nuclear size is closely tied to cell size. The study also showed that the regulation of global cellular processes, such as transcription and translation, and the levels of specific structural components of the nucleus are important for maintaining a stable nuclear size.

These findings have implications for our understanding of nuclear size control in multicellular organisms, where the nucleocytoplasmic ratio varies between cell types but is generally restricted to a narrow range. The study suggests that nuclear volume is determined by cell volume, rather than directly by DNA content, and highlights the importance of RNA processing and LINC complexes in regulating nuclear size.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on patients with neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET). The model uses coupled oscillators to represent neurons in areas of the brain that generate pathological oscillations. By analyzing how brain oscillations change when stimulation is applied, the model predicts that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and that stimulation should have a greater effect when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. This prediction is based on a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, which has been shown to generalize to other models and biologically realistic neural circuits.

The researchers compared their predictions with data from ET patients and found that the phase-dependent effects of stimulation were consistent with the model. They also proposed a new hybrid strategy that combines two existing closed-loop DBS approaches: phase-locked and adaptive DBS. Phase-locked DBS delivers stimulation according to the instantaneous phase of the oscillations, while adaptive DBS applies high-frequency stimulation when the amplitude of oscillations exceeds a certain threshold.

The model's predictions have not been directly compared with experimental effects of closed-loop DBS before. The researchers' findings suggest that a phase-specific stimulation strategy could improve the efficiency and efficacy of DBS, while reducing side effects. The proposed hybrid strategy aims to combine the benefits of both phase-locked and adaptive DBS approaches.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool to detect the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, which causes intestinal and hepatic schistosomiasis, a disease affecting over 230 million people worldwide. The tool, called Biompha-LAMP, is a rapid and sensitive loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay that can detect the parasite's DNA in snails, the intermediate hosts of the disease. The assay uses a simple DNA extraction method and can detect as little as 0.1 femtograms of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes.

The researchers tested Biompha-LAMP on snails infected with S. mansoni at different stages of infection, including early prepatent period, light infections, and detection of infected snails in pooled samples. The assay was able to detect S. mansoni DNA in all groups of snails using a simple DNA extraction method. Biompha-LAMP is specific, sensitive, and rapid, making it a cost-effective method for screening intermediate hosts infected with S. mansoni in both individual snails and pooled samples.

This new diagnostic tool has the potential to be used in large-scale field surveys for schistosomes control campaigns in endemic areas. The researchers suggest that Biompha-LAMP could be used to monitor infected snails in areas where schistosomiasis is common, allowing for more effective disease control measures to be put in place. The development of Biompha-LAMP is an important step towards the elimination of schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide.
A recent study in Sri Lanka estimated the costs of dengue control activities and hospitalizations in the public health sector during an epidemic year in the country's most heavily urbanized district, Colombo. The study found that the total cost of dengue control and hospitalizations was approximately $3.45 million, or $1.50 per capita, in Colombo district in 2012. Personnel costs accounted for the largest share of the total costs, making up 79% of the costs of dengue control activities and 46% of the costs of hospitalizations. The average cost per hospitalization ranged from $216 to $609 for pediatric cases and $196 to $866 for adult cases, depending on the severity of the disease and the treatment setting. The study suggests that dengue poses a significant economic burden on the public health sector in Sri Lanka, with a per capita cost of $0.42 for dengue control activities. This analysis is the first attempt to assess the economic burden of dengue response in the public health sector in Sri Lanka and highlights the need for country-specific evidence to inform public health priorities and resource allocation. The study's findings indicate that the resources used for dengue prevention and hospital care services are substantial and could be reallocated to other health services.
A recent study has reevaluated the origins of European paternal lineages, specifically the haplogroup R1b1b2 (R-M269), which is the most common Y-chromosomal lineage among European men. Previous research suggested that this lineage originated in the Paleolithic era, but the new study found that its geographical distribution is best explained by its spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic period. This indicates that most European Y chromosomes originated in the Neolithic expansion, making Europe a prime example of how technological and cultural change is linked with the expansion of a Y-chromosomal lineage. The study also found that other lineages, such as hgE1b1b1 (E-M35) and hgJ, show evidence of European Neolithic expansion. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA diversity presents a different picture, with no east-west cline and most lineages having a Paleolithic time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). The study suggests that the predominance of Neolithic-expansion lineages among Y chromosomes is not reflected in other parts of the genome, indicating a unique role for males in the transition. The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of European population history and the relationship between technological and cultural change and the expansion of Y-chromosomal lineages.
A recent study investigated the relationship between movement variability and the speed of motor learning. Contrary to previous suggestions, the research found that movement variability does not consistently increase the speed of motor learning. In fact, simulations and experiments showed that increased variability can sometimes slow down learning. The study used computational modeling and a meta-analysis of published papers to examine the relationship between movement variability and learning rate. The results suggest that the relationship between the two is complex and can vary depending on the specific task and factors involved. The study proposes that motor variability is correlated with learning rate in a task-specific way, meaning that the relationship between the two can be positive, negative, or zero, depending on the dominant factor affecting task performance. The research also highlights the importance of considering sensory uncertainty and observation noise when studying the relationship between movement variability and learning rate. Overall, the study suggests that the relationship between movement variability and motor learning is more complex than previously thought, and further research is needed to understand the relative importance of the involved factors.
Researchers have studied the interaction between RelA, a key protein in the NF-κB pathway, and its co-activators CBP and p300. NF-κB plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses, cell survival, and proliferation by regulating gene transcription. The interaction between RelA and CBP/p300 is essential for the transcription of certain genes involved in these processes. To understand this interaction, the researchers used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to determine the structure of the RelA:CBP complex. They found that RelA's transcriptional activation domain (TAD) binds to the TAZ1 domain of CBP/p300 through well-conserved hydrophobic sites on the TAZ1 surface. The researchers also designed RelA mutants that selectively disrupted the interaction between RelA and CBP/p300. Using cell-based techniques, mathematical modeling, and genome-wide gene expression analysis, they found that a larger set of RelA-activated genes is affected by this interaction than previously thought. The study also showed that the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction controls the nuclear response of NF-κB through a negative feedback loop. Additionally, chromatin analysis revealed that CBP/p300 is constitutively recruited to RelA target gene promoters, suggesting a role in recruiting RelA to its target sites. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of NF-κB-driven transcription and the role of the RelA:CBP/p300 interaction in regulating gene expression.
Researchers have developed a new method called Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TcGSA) to analyze gene expression data collected over time. Unlike previous methods, TcGSA can handle repeated measurements and missing data, making it suitable for longitudinal studies. The method uses random effects modeling to identify predefined groups of genes (gene sets) that show significant changes in expression over time. TcGSA can detect subtle changes in gene expression and account for heterogeneity within gene sets.

The method was applied to two real-life datasets: an HIV vaccine trial and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the HIV trial, TcGSA identified 69 gene sets with significant changes in expression over time, whereas other methods failed to detect any significant patterns. In the influenza and pneumococcal vaccine study, TcGSA identified 4 gene sets linked to the influenza vaccine, which were previously associated with the pneumococcal vaccine.

A simulation study showed that TcGSA has good statistical properties and increased power compared to other methods for analyzing time-course expression patterns of gene sets. The method is available as an R package for the research community. TcGSA can be used to detect and interpret subtle changes in gene expression over time, making it a valuable tool for analyzing longitudinal gene expression data.
A new map of the global distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a parasite that causes malaria, has been created using data from 9,970 geopositioned surveys collected between 1985 and 2010. The map shows that P. vivax is found in a relatively narrow range of areas around the world, with the highest levels of transmission in Central Asia, particularly in India and Myanmar. The Americas contribute 22% of the global area at risk of P. vivax transmission, but high-endemic areas are sparsely populated and account for only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk globally. In Africa, stable transmission is limited to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, contributing 3.5% of the global population at risk.

The map was created using a spatiotemporal Bayesian model-based geostatistical approach, which incorporates data on Duffy negativity, a genetic trait that makes some people resistant to P. vivax infection. The model predicts that the point estimate of P. vivax parasite rate rarely exceeds 7% in areas of stable transmission. The map is intended to contribute to a shift towards geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for P. vivax control and elimination. The study found that the predicted endemicity values for most of the continent were highly certain, but the pockets of higher endemicity in Madagascar and northern East Africa were predicted with less certainty. The map provides a comprehensive evidence-base for P. vivax infections worldwide and will inform global risk maps for this neglected disease.
Staphylococcus aureus is a type of bacteria that can cause skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). Researchers have identified a protein called clumping factor B (ClfB) as a key player in the bacteria's ability to infect the skin. ClfB helps S. aureus stick to the skin and evade the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off the infection. In this study, scientists investigated the role of ClfB in SSTIs and found that it plays a crucial role in determining the structure and bacterial burden of skin abscesses. They also discovered that ClfB interacts with a protein called loricrin, which is found in the skin, to facilitate this process. This interaction is specific to the skin and does not occur in other parts of the body. The study suggests that targeting ClfB with a vaccine could be an effective way to prevent SSTIs. In fact, a model vaccine that induced both humoral and cellular responses against ClfB provided protection against S. aureus skin infection. These findings identify ClfB as an important antigen for future SSTI vaccines. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of S. aureus infection and highlights the potential of ClfB as a target for vaccine development.
Researchers have developed a new tool to predict the effectiveness of different HIV prevention strategies, including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). The tool, called a hybrid stochastic framework, takes into account various factors such as the medication's pharmacokinetics, viral characteristics, and host factors to estimate the likelihood of HIV transmission. The researchers applied this framework to the medication dolutegravir (DTG), a second-generation integrase inhibitor, and found that a daily dose of 50mg DTG could prevent 99-100% of HIV infections when taken as PrEP, and 85% of infections when 50% of dosing events were missed. They also found that PrEP "on demand" could prevent 79-84% of infections, and PEP could prevent more than 80% of infections if initiated within 6 hours after virus exposure and continued for as long as possible. These results suggest that DTG could be a viable alternative to the current PrEP medication, Truvada. The researchers believe that their framework can be adapted to other PrEP candidates and can help guide the development of new HIV prevention strategies.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been found to induce autophagy, a cellular process that helps the virus replicate. However, how HCV regulates autophagy was not well understood. Researchers discovered that HCV infection triggers the expression of two proteins, Rubicon and UVRAG, which have opposing effects on autophagy. Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophagosomes, while UVRAG stimulates it. As a result, autophagosomes accumulate in the early stages of HCV infection. The study found that Rubicon plays a positive role in HCV replication, as suppressing its expression reduces HCV replication, while over-expressing it enhances it. In contrast, over-expressing UVRAG, which facilitates the maturation of autophagosomes, suppresses HCV replication. The researchers also found that the HCV NS4B protein is sufficient to induce Rubicon and autophagosomes. The study suggests that HCV differentially regulates the expression of Rubicon and UVRAG to temporally regulate autophagic flux and enhance its replication. The results indicate that autophagosomes serve as sites for HCV RNA replication, and Rubicon enhances HCV RNA replication by increasing the pool of autophagosomes in infected cells. Overall, the study provides new insights into how HCV manipulates autophagy to facilitate its replication.
Cyclin Y-like 1 (CCNYL1), a newly identified member of the cyclin family, plays a crucial role in regulating spermatogenesis in mice. Unlike its homologue, Cyclin Y (CCNY), CCNYL1 is specifically expressed in the testis and is essential for male fertility. Mice lacking CCNYL1 (Ccnyl1-/-) are infertile, while mice lacking CCNY (Ccny-/-) have normal fertility. Sperm cells from Ccnyl1-/- mice display impaired motility and structural defects, suggesting that CCNYL1 is necessary for proper sperm function.

The interaction between CCNYL1 and cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16) is essential for spermatogenesis. CCNYL1 and CDK16 form a protein complex that increases the stability and kinase activity of CDK16. The interaction between CCNYL1 and CDK16 also leads to the phosphorylation of CDK16, which is necessary for their binding and the modulation of CDK16's kinase activity. The phosphorylation sites of CDK16 were identified, and several modifications on the N-terminal region of CDK16 were found to be crucial for the interaction with CCNYL1 and the modulation of CDK16's kinase activity.

The CCNYL1 and CDK16 protein complex is essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility in mice. CCNYL1 may be a potential target for the development of male contraceptives or drugs that specifically inhibit CCNYL1 expression or CCNYL1/CDK16 activity. The study suggests that CCNYL1 plays a unique role in regulating spermatogenesis, distinct from its homologue CCNY.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated microvascular endothelial injury. EHEC hemolysin (EHEC-Hly), a virulence factor, exists in two forms: free and associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by EHEC. While the free toxin is lytic to human endothelium, the effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, the primary targets during EHEC infection, are unknown. Researchers investigated the biological effects of OMV-associated EHEC-Hly on human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) and Caco-2 cells. They found that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly does not lyse these cells but triggers their apoptosis. The toxin is internalized by the cells via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs and trafficked to endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon endosome acidification, EHEC-Hly separates from OMVs, escapes from lysosomes, and targets mitochondria, leading to a decrease in mitochondrial transmembrane potential and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, resulting in apoptotic cell death. This study reveals a novel mechanism of EHEC-Hly involvement in the pathogenesis of EHEC diseases, where OMV-mediated intracellular delivery allows the toxin to target mitochondria. The findings suggest that OMV-associated EHEC-Hly irreversibly injures human microvascular endothelial and intestinal epithelial cells, key players in the pathogenesis of EHEC-mediated diseases.
Research in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has uncovered a complex relationship between two proteins involved in gene expression: P-TEFb/Cdk9 and histone H2B ubiquitylation. P-TEFb/Cdk9 is a positive transcription elongation factor that helps RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) move along the DNA template, while histone H2B ubiquitylation (H2Bub1) plays a key role in coordinating histone modifications during transcription. The study found that H2Bub1 and P-TEFb/Cdk9 interact in a bidirectional manner, with each influencing the activity of the other. Lowering P-TEFb/Cdk9 activity or preventing it from phosphorylating its substrate, Spt5, reduces H2Bub1 levels. Conversely, mutations in the H2Bub1 pathway impair P-TEFb/Cdk9 recruitment to chromatin and decrease Spt5 phosphorylation. Genome-wide analyses revealed that P-TEFb/Cdk9 and H2Bub1 have opposing effects on the distribution of transcribing RNAPII. The study suggests that a balance between P-TEFb/Cdk9 and H2Bub1 is necessary to regulate elongation, and that loss of H2Bub1 disrupts this balance, leading to aberrant gene expression and cell morphologies. The findings imply that other pathways can modulate the functions of P-TEFb/Cdk9 and H2Bub1, and that P-TEFb activity is required to overcome repressive effects of histone modifications.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) remains a significant cause of illness and death in South America and Africa. Researchers analyzed the largest collection of YFV genetic data to date, covering 133 isolates from 22 countries over 76 years. The study found that the current strains of YFV originated in Africa around 1,500 years ago and were introduced to the Americas through the slave trade around 300-400 years ago. From there, the virus spread westward across the continent and persists in the jungles of South America.

The researchers used a technique called phylogenetic analysis to reconstruct the evolutionary history of YFV. They found that the virus can be divided into two groups, one in Africa and one in the Americas, with distinct lineages in each region. The study also found that the virus has not undergone significant changes in diversity in either Africa or South America, suggesting that it has been present in these regions for a long time.

The researchers suggest that the introduction of YFV to the Americas was facilitated by the slave trade, which brought infected individuals from Africa to the New World. The virus then established a cycle of transmission in the Amazon, Araguaia, and Orinoco river basins, where it is still present today. The study highlights the importance of gene sequence data in understanding the spread of infectious diseases and the role of human migration in their introduction to new regions.
Researchers studied how the bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae causes disease in infant mice, both with and without the presence of influenza A virus (IAV) co-infection. They found that when IAV is present, the bacteria must pass through single cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and in transmission between hosts. This means that only a small number of bacteria are able to survive and continue to cause disease.

The researchers used an infant mouse model to study the effects of IAV co-infection on pneumococcal colonization, disease, and transmission. They found that IAV increases the burden of colonizing pneumococci, consistent with previous observations in infant mice. The study suggests that the bottleneck in transmission occurs between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, and that the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming this bottleneck.

The researchers also found that passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. This means that the bacteria do not undergo significant genetic changes as they pass through these bottlenecks. The study demonstrates how viral infection, and the immune responses it stimulates, drive bacterial contagion. The findings have implications for understanding how pneumococcal disease is transmitted and how it can be controlled.
Researchers have identified two proteins from the saliva of Phlebotomus orientalis, a sand fly species that transmits Leishmania donovani, the parasite responsible for visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa. The proteins, mYEL1 and mAG5, were found to be effective in detecting antibodies against P. orientalis in human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia, countries where visceral leishmaniasis is prevalent. These proteins were produced using recombinant DNA technology and were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblotting. The results showed that the combination of mYEL1 and mAG5 was the most effective in detecting antibodies against P. orientalis, with a high correlation coefficient and specificity compared to the whole sand fly salivary gland homogenate. This is the first study to use recombinant salivary proteins to screen human sera for exposure to P. orientalis bites. The researchers found that 52% of the sera samples from Sudan and 34.5% from Ethiopia tested positive for anti-P. orientalis antibodies, indicating a high level of exposure to the sand fly bites. The study suggests that the combination of mYEL1 and mAG5 can be used as a valid tool to screen for exposure to P. orientalis bites in human populations from endemic areas.
Researchers have found that Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI1), a mobile genetic element, can modify the mating apparatus of IncC conjugative plasmids to enhance its own transfer. IncC plasmids are commonly found in pathogenic bacteria and contribute to antibiotic resistance. SGI1 is not self-transmissible, but it carries genes that encode proteins similar to those found in IncC plasmids, which are essential for conjugative transfer. The researchers discovered that SGI1's traNS, traHS, and traGS genes are under the control of the AcaCD transcriptional activator complex, which is also found in IncC plasmids. They found that these genes are essential for SGI1's transfer and that they can replace the corresponding genes in IncC plasmids. The researchers also found that SGI1 remodels the mating pore encoded by IncC plasmids, allowing it to transfer more efficiently than the helper plasmid. This remodeling also disables an IncC-encoded entry exclusion mechanism, allowing SGI1 to invade cells bearing IncC plasmids. The study suggests that SGI1's ability to modify the mating apparatus of IncC plasmids is a key factor in its ability to spread in bacterial populations. The findings have implications for understanding the spread of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria.
Researchers have discovered that the Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 plays a crucial role in allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage by inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53. When cells are exposed to persistent or irreparable DNA damage, they can escape the cell-cycle arrest imposed by the DNA damage checkpoint through a process called adaptation. However, the precise mechanism of adaptation remained unknown until now. The study found that Cdc5 overproduction promotes faster adaptation, indicating that high levels of Cdc5 modulate the ability of the checkpoint to inhibit the downstream cell-cycle machinery. Further investigation revealed that Cdc5 acts to attenuate the DNA damage checkpoint through the loss of Rad53 hyperphosphorylation, allowing cells to adapt to DNA damage. This mechanism is likely conserved in other organisms, including vertebrates, as polo-like kinase homologs have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to facilitate the activation of downstream checkpoint kinases. The study suggests that Cdc5 does not inhibit the formation of the Rad9-Rad53 complex, but rather blocks the ability of Mec1-primed Rad53 molecules to produce hyperphosphorylated Rad53 in vivo. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of adaptation to DNA damage and highlight the importance of Cdc5 in regulating the DNA damage checkpoint.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework, called the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nernst-Planck (KNP) framework, to study the movement of ions in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain. The ECS is the space outside of brain cells, and changes in ion concentrations in this space are associated with various pathological conditions, such as seizures and stroke. The KNP framework allows for the simultaneous tracking of ion concentrations and electric potential in the ECS, which is currently unfeasible experimentally. By assuming electroneutrality, the framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes and makes it possible to run simulations on large spatiotemporal scales using a standard desktop computer. The framework was used to simulate the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the 3-D KNP framework and its potential to explore pathological conditions associated with large concentration variations in the ECS. The framework can be applied to more complex and biologically realistic systems, making it a valuable tool for understanding brain function and disease. The KNP framework is the first simulation framework that can handle 3-D electrodiffusion in neuronal tissue at large spatiotemporal scales without requiring excessive computer power.
A recent proposal to cut funding for mosquito-borne disease surveillance and research at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) could leave the country ill-prepared to handle new emerging diseases and manage existing ones. To demonstrate the consequences of this measure, researchers evaluated the impact of delayed control responses to dengue epidemics in an economically developed urban environment. They used a mathematical model to simulate hypothetical scenarios of delayed response to a dengue introduction in the City of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The results showed that halting mosquito surveillance can increase the management costs of epidemics by up to an order of magnitude compared to a strategy with sustained surveillance and early case detection. The study found that the total costs of preparedness through surveillance are far lower than the costs needed to respond to the introduction of vector-borne pathogens. In fact, the costs of a delayed response to a dengue outbreak in Cairns would have been up to $382 million, compared to $1.1 million with sustained surveillance. The researchers emphasize the need for improved and sustainable systems for vector-borne disease surveillance and argue that the proposed budget cut would jeopardize the capability of the existing health infrastructure for early detection of other exotic mosquito-transmitted pathogens. The study provides a science-based justification for re-assessing the proposal to slash the CDC vector-borne diseases program budget and highlights the importance of continued funding for vector-borne disease research and surveillance.
A study conducted in western Nicaragua found that dengue fever is a significant cause of acute febrile illness in children and adults, particularly in rural areas. Researchers collected data from 740 patients aged 1 year and older who presented with fever, and found that 63.5% of them were seropositive for dengue at enrollment. The seroprevalence of dengue increased with age, reaching over 90% in people over 20 years old. Acute dengue was identified in 5.1% of patients, with serotypes 1 and 2 being the most common. Notably, only 8.1% of confirmed cases were suspected clinically, indicating that dengue is a largely unrecognized cause of fever in the region. The study also found that dengue was the only flavivirus circulating in humans in Nicaragua during the study period, reducing the likelihood of serologic cross-reactions with other flaviviruses. The results suggest that dengue is an important public health concern in western Nicaragua, particularly given the region's vulnerability to the Zika virus, which is transmitted by the same vector and has been associated with severe congenital infections. The study's findings highlight the need for increased awareness and surveillance of dengue in the region.
Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant damage to crops, resulting in billions of dollars in losses each year. To defend against these pests, plants have an innate immune system that recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through surface-localized receptors, triggering a response called PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). However, the role of PTI in plant-nematode interactions is not well understood. Researchers have identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR-RLK) in Arabidopsis, called NILR1, which is essential for PTI responses initiated by nematodes. NILR1 is specifically regulated upon nematode infection and is dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. Loss-of-function mutants of NILR1 are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nematodes, indicating that NILR1 plays a crucial role in plant defense against nematodes. This is the first example of an immune receptor involved in the induction of basal immunity (PTI) in plants or animals in response to nematodes. The discovery of NILR1 provides new options for nematode control in crop plants and sheds light on the molecular mechanisms underlying plant-nematode interactions.
Researchers have found that the anti-cancer drug miltefosine can enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and fight Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic worm that causes schistosomiasis. In a laboratory study, miltefosine was used to treat adult S. mansoni worms in a dish, and the researchers found that it caused the worms to expose certain proteins on their surface. These proteins, which are normally hidden from the immune system, can trigger an immune response and help the body fight the parasite. The researchers identified four specific proteins that were exposed by miltefosine treatment: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. They also found that antibodies against these proteins were able to bind to the surface of young schistosomula, the larval stage of the parasite, and cause them to clump together. This suggests that these antibodies may play a role in protecting against schistosomiasis. The study's findings provide new insights into how miltefosine works against S. mansoni and could lead to the development of new treatments for the disease. The researchers propose that targeting these exposed proteins with antibodies could enhance the effectiveness of miltefosine and help prevent re-infection.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the bacterium Bacillus cereus acquires iron from its host. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and survival, but it is often scarce in the environment. To overcome this limitation, B. cereus uses a surface protein called IlsA to bind to ferritin, a protein that stores iron in the host's cells. IlsA causes ferritin to aggregate on the bacterial surface, making it easier for the bacterium to access the iron inside. The researchers used a technique called isothermal titration calorimetry to show that IlsA directly interacts with the shell subunits of ferritin. They also found that IlsA enhances the release of iron from ferritin, a process that has never been observed before in bacteria. The researchers propose a new model of iron acquisition in B. cereus, where IlsA binds to ferritin, destabilizing its structure and allowing the siderophore bacillibactin to extract the iron. This process is crucial for the bacterium's growth and virulence. Disrupting the production of bacillibactin reduced the bacterium's ability to use ferritin for growth and its virulence in insects. The study provides new insights into how B. cereus adapts to its host and how bacteria in general acquire iron from their environment. Further research is needed to determine if IlsA's ability to bind ferritin is a common feature of other pathogenic bacteria.
A new mathematical model of the post-translational Kai circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus has been developed. The clock is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two domains, CI and CII, which can bind and hydrolyze ATP. The model suggests that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic driving force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active and inactive conformational state. Phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for the hydrolysis in the CI domain. The model also explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC and how the differential affinity of KaiA for different KaiC phosphoforms generates the characteristic temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. The model shows that as the phosphorylation level in the CII domain rises, the release of ADP from CI slows down, making the inactive conformational state of KaiC more stable. In the inactive state, KaiC binds KaiB, which stabilizes this state and leads to the sequestration of KaiA, resulting in KaiC dephosphorylation. The model is thermodynamically consistent and can describe a wealth of experimental data using a dedicated kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a stealthy virus that can evade the host's immune system and cause chronic infection. Researchers have been trying to understand how HBV suppresses the innate immune response, which is the body's first line of defense against viral infections. Specifically, they wanted to know why HBV doesn't trigger the production of interferon-beta (IFN-β), a protein that helps fight off viral infections.

   The study found that HBV recruits a protein called parkin to the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells. Parkin then interacts with another protein called MAVS, which is involved in triggering the innate immune response. The interaction between parkin and MAVS leads to the formation of unanchored linear polyubiquitin chains on MAVS, which disrupts its ability to activate the immune response.

   As a result, the production of IFN-β is suppressed, allowing HBV to establish a persistent infection. The researchers also found that silencing parkin in cells infected with HBV restored the production of IFN-β, suggesting that parkin plays a key role in suppressing the innate immune response during HBV infection. This study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which HBV evades the host's immune system and highlights the importance of mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity.
Researchers have identified a novel superantigen, pfiT, associated with Crohn's disease, a type of inflammatory bowel disease. PfiT is encoded by the pfiT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, a type of bacteria found in the gut. The study found that pfiT binds to human immune cells, specifically to a type of protein called class II MHC, and stimulates the proliferation of lymphocytes. This binding is specific to class II MHC and is inhibited by antibodies that target this protein. The researchers also found that pfiT directly interacts with HLA-DR1, a specific type of class II MHC. Additionally, pfiT competes with another superantigen, Mycoplasma arthritidis mitogen (MAM), for binding to HLA-DR, suggesting that their binding sites overlap. The structure of pfiT was determined to be distinct from other known superantigens, indicating that it belongs to a new family of T cell superantigens. The study suggests that pfiT plays a role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease and may serve as a biomarker for the disease. The discovery of pfiT and its interaction with human immune cells provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying Crohn's disease and may lead to the development of new treatments.
Researchers have found that the gene Nanog plays a crucial role in determining the heterogeneity of embryonic stem cell populations. Nanog is a key regulator of pluripotency, which is the ability of stem cells to develop into any cell type in the body. The study used a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of stem cells and found that the heterogeneity of Nanog expression is influenced by two main factors: allelic control and gene expression noise. Allelic control refers to the different versions of the Nanog gene that are present in each cell, while gene expression noise refers to the random fluctuations in the amount of Nanog protein produced by each cell.

The researchers found that the combination of allelic control and gene expression noise leads to a bimodal distribution of Nanog expression in stem cell populations. This means that some cells have high levels of Nanog, while others have low levels. The study also found that the dynamics of Nanog expression are state-dependent, meaning that the rate at which Nanog is turned on or off depends on the current state of the cell.

The researchers used a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of stem cells and found that allelic regulation is a key determinant of stem cell population heterogeneity. They also found that the use of stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in a single allelic locus can lead to inaccurate results due to differences in the half-lives of the reporter and native proteins. The study suggests that allelic control of Nanog expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance between self-renewing and differentiating cells in stem cell populations.
Scientists have long known that the costs and benefits of protein expression play a crucial role in the evolution and regulation of the proteome, the complete set of proteins produced by an organism. In bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, the rate of cellular growth is a key component of fitness, and much of the proteome is devoted to growth in certain environments. However, the percentage of the proteome that is unused in a given environment and how much this unused protein fraction can vary across environments has remained unknown.

To address this challenge, researchers combined a genome-scale model of proteome allocation in E. coli with genome-scale absolute proteomics measurements to quantify proteome allocation across 16 distinct environments. They found that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments, and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains more than 95% of the variance in growth rates of E. coli across these environments.

The researchers also discovered that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. They classified the unused protein and found that it encodes several nutrient- and stress-preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. This suggests that unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to investigate the genetic factors contributing to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) in three major ethnic populations in Southeast Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Asian Indians. The study analyzed data from over 6,000 individuals, including 2,010 cases and 3,945 controls. The researchers aimed to assess the transferability and relevance of previously identified genetic variants associated with T2D in European populations to these Asian populations.

The study found that two genetic loci, CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11, showed strong associations with T2D in all three ethnic groups. However, the effect sizes of these associations varied across populations. The study also detected variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for these loci, which may contribute to the failure to detect associations across diverse ethnic groups.

The researchers used a meta-analysis to combine the results from the three ethnic groups and found that the associations at CDKAL1 and HHEX/IDE/KIF11 loci were consistent with previous studies in European populations. However, the signals of association at CDKAL1 were stronger in the Chinese and Indian populations compared to European studies. The study highlights the importance of conducting GWAS in diverse populations to better understand the genetic architecture of T2D and to identify population-specific genetic variants contributing to the disease.
Researchers studied the process of nuclear division in the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. They found that a protein called Aurora B kinase Ipl1 plays a crucial role in this process. Ipl1 helps to break down the nuclear envelope, allowing the nucleus to move to the daughter cell during mitosis. Without Ipl1, the nuclear envelope does not break down properly, and the nucleus does not move to the daughter cell in a timely manner. This leads to defects in kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. The researchers also found that Ipl1 is essential for the stability of microtubules, which are important for cell division. When Ipl1 is depleted, the microtubules become unstable, leading to further defects in nuclear division. The study suggests that Ipl1 regulates the activity of other proteins, such as Bim1 and dynein, which are involved in nuclear migration. By regulating these proteins, Ipl1 helps to ensure that the nucleus moves to the daughter cell in a timely and accurate manner. The researchers propose that the timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope by Ipl1 is necessary for its own nuclear entry and for the regulation of nuclear division during mitosis in C. neoformans.
Researchers studied a rare and aggressive form of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in a patient who had a specific genetic mutation in the RET proto-oncogene. The mutation, known as p.Cys634Arg, is a known driver of MTC, but the patient also had a second mutation, p.Cys630=, which was initially thought to be harmless because it did not change the amino acid sequence of the protein. However, next-generation sequencing revealed that the two mutations were located close to each other on the same chromosome, suggesting they were inherited together. The researchers found that the p.Cys630= mutation increased the production of the RET protein, making the cancer more aggressive. Further analysis showed that the p.Cys630= mutation created new binding sites for a protein called SRp55, which enhanced the maturation of the RET pre-mRNA and increased the production of mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET receptor. This is a novel mechanism by which a synonymous mutation can contribute to cancer progression. The study highlights the importance of considering the effects of synonymous mutations, which are often overlooked in large-scale cancer genome studies. The findings suggest that the p.Cys630= mutation played a significant role in the development and progression of the patient's MTC.
Researchers have developed a new bioinformatics system to remove contaminants and low-complexity genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens. This is crucial for accurate diagnosis of human infections using metagenomic sequencing, a method that captures all DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a human sample. Contamination in reference genomes can lead to false identification of pathogens, hindering diagnosis. The new system identifies and removes human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences, as well as low-complexity genomic sequences, from a comprehensive database of sequenced eukaryotic pathogen genomes. This results in a "clean" database of eukaryotic pathogen genomes for use with bioinformatics classification and analysis tools.

The system was tested on a large set of eukaryotic pathogen genomes, yielding a cleaned and filtered database ready for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including those intended for next-generation sequencing (NGS) diagnostics. The new database provides better sensitivity and a significant reduction in false positives compared to using the original genomes. The method can be applied to both complete and draft reference genomes and has the potential to improve the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosis of human infections.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals, in Uganda. They analyzed 269 parasite isolates collected from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya between 1959 and 2011. The isolates were genotyped at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the presence of a gene that confers human infectivity to the parasite.

The results showed that the parasite isolates from Uganda and southwestern Kenya can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters. Two of the clusters contain isolates from central and southern Uganda, while the third cluster contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. The clusters are not sorted by subspecies designation, host, or date of collection. The analysis also revealed genetic admixture among the clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and ongoing gene flow between them.

The study found that the expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of the subspecies T. b. rhodesiense. The results also confirmed the emergence of human-infective strains from non-infective T. b. brucei strains of different genetic backgrounds, and the importance of cattle as a reservoir for the parasite. The study's findings have implications for the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) plays a crucial role in regulating the inflammatory response, particularly in the context of endotoxic shock. Researchers found that mice lacking TXNIP (Txnip−/−) are highly susceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. This increased susceptibility is due to excessive production of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in Txnip−/− macrophages. An inhibitor of iNOS rescued Txnip−/− mice from endotoxic shock-induced death, indicating that NO is a major factor in TXNIP-mediated endotoxic shock.

The study suggests that TXNIP regulates NO production via the NF-κB/iNOS pathway, and its absence leads to excessive NO production. This excessive NO inhibits the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is responsible for the production of IL-1β, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine. The researchers found that S-nitrosylation of NLRP3 by NO reduces IL-1β production, making Txnip−/− mice more susceptible to endotoxic shock.

The study demonstrates that TXNIP is a novel molecule that links NO synthesis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during endotoxic shock. The findings suggest that TXNIP plays a critical role as a negative modulator of NO and iNOS expression during LPS-induced endotoxic shock. Overall, the study highlights the importance of TXNIP in regulating the inflammatory response and its potential role in disease states associated with sepsis.
Researchers have identified a new protein called ZTF-8 that plays a crucial role in repairing damaged DNA in the reproductive cells of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. This protein is conserved across species, from worms to humans, and is essential for fixing breaks in DNA that occur during cell division. When ZTF-8 is missing, the worm's reproductive cells are unable to properly repair DNA damage, leading to genetic mutations and impaired fertility. The researchers found that ZTF-8 interacts with a complex of proteins called the 9-1-1 complex, which helps to detect and respond to DNA damage. Without ZTF-8, the worm's cells are unable to activate a critical checkpoint that prevents damaged cells from dividing, leading to increased cell death and reduced fertility. The researchers also found that ZTF-8 is involved in repairing DNA breaks that occur during meiosis, a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells. They propose that ZTF-8 helps to promote the repair of stalled replication forks and meiotic DNA breaks by transmitting signals through the 9-1-1 pathway. The discovery of ZTF-8's role in DNA repair has important implications for understanding how genetic mutations occur and how they can be prevented. The researchers also found that the human version of ZTF-8, called RHINO, can rescue the defects caused by the loss of ZTF-8 in the worm, suggesting that the protein's function is conserved across species.
Scientists have discovered a key mechanism that controls the development of motor neurons in the neural tube. Motor neuron progenitors differentiate more quickly than other progenitors, and researchers used single-cell transcriptomics to study this process. They found that the transcription factor Olig2 plays a crucial role in the transition of neural progenitors into motor neurons. Olig2 represses the expression of Hes1 and Hes5, which are effectors of the Notch signaling pathway. This repression is direct, as Olig2 binds to a specific regulatory element in the Hes5 locus, preventing its expression in motor neuron progenitors. By modulating the Notch pathway, Olig2 not only specifies motor neuron identity but also determines the rate at which these progenitors differentiate, controlling the spatial and temporal pattern of motor neuron generation. The study reveals a tight coupling between the regulatory networks that control patterning and neuronal differentiation. The findings suggest that Olig2 acts as a developmental pacemaker, coordinating the production of motor neurons. The research also shows that Notch signaling controls the transition between distinct phases of Olig2 expression, and that inhibiting Notch signaling up-regulates Olig2, leading to motor neuron differentiation. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex process of motor neuron development and the role of Olig2 in regulating this process.
Researchers used a nonhuman primate model to study the role of T cells in protecting against the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. They first infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal human H1N1 isolate to "prime" their cellular immunity. Four months later, the animals were challenged with the H1N1pdm virus. The results showed that the "primed" animals had a stronger and faster cellular immune response against the H1N1pdm virus compared to naive animals. This response involved both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and peaked earlier in the "primed" animals. The "primed" animals also cleared the H1N1pdm virus from their upper and lower respiratory tracts significantly faster than the naive animals, even before the appearance of H1N1pdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. The study suggests that cross-reactive T cell responses can mediate early clearance of an antigenically novel influenza virus in primates. The findings have implications for the development of vaccines that can induce such cross-reactive T cells to protect humans against severe disease caused by newly emerging pandemic influenza viruses.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool to detect Q fever, a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii. The new method, called Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), is a rapid, simple, and sensitive test that can detect the presence of C. burnetii in human and animal samples. The LAMP assay targets the htpAB gene of C. burnetii and can detect as few as one copy of the gene per reaction. The test is specific to C. burnetii and does not cross-react with other bacteria.

In a study, the LAMP assay was compared to real-time PCR, a more commonly used diagnostic method, and found to be more sensitive and rapid. The LAMP assay was able to detect C. burnetii in 33.3% of unknown febrile patients, compared to 8.3% detected by real-time PCR. Similarly, the LAMP assay detected C. burnetii in 7.9% of animal samples, compared to 0.8% detected by real-time PCR. The LAMP assay was also used to confirm Q fever cases in the Yi Li area of Xinjiang Province, China.

The LAMP assay is a potential tool for diagnosing Q fever in humans and animals, particularly in rural areas of China where access to sophisticated equipment and complicated protocols may be limited. The test is cost-effective and can be performed without the need for specialized equipment, making it a valuable diagnostic tool for areas with limited resources.
Researchers have discovered a new class of regulatory elements called embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers (ESSEs) that play a key role in the expression of genes in cancer. These enhancers are normally active in embryonic stem cells but are silenced in differentiated cells. However, in cancer, ESSEs are often reactivated, leading to the expression of genes that are typically turned off in normal cells. The researchers found that ESSEs are prone to DNA methylation changes, which can either silence or activate gene expression. In cancer, ESSEs that are normally methylated in differentiated cells are often hypomethylated, leading to the up-regulation of genes involved in developmental signaling pathways. Conversely, ESSEs that are normally unmethylated in embryonic stem cells are often hypermethylated in cancer, leading to the silencing of genes. The researchers identified a specific ESSE downstream of the VEGFA gene, which is involved in blood vessel formation, and found that its methylation state affects VEGFA expression levels in cancer. The study suggests that ESSEs provide a framework for the reactivation of embryonic stem cell genes in cancer, which may contribute to the development and progression of the disease. The findings have implications for understanding the epigenetic mechanisms underlying cancer and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.
Researchers investigated how dividing a population into smaller groups, or demes, affects the time it takes for the population to overcome obstacles in its genetic makeup, known as fitness valleys or plateaus. They used a simplified model to study the effect of subdivision on a population's ability to adapt to its environment. The study found that subdividing a population into demes connected by migration can significantly speed up the process of crossing fitness valleys or plateaus. However, this effect only occurs when the demes are in a state of sequential fixation, where one deme adapts faster than the others.

The researchers used mathematical equations to determine the conditions under which subdivision accelerates the crossing of fitness valleys or plateaus. They found that the optimal speedup occurs when the demes are in the sequential fixation regime. The study also showed that subdivision can accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus in a wide range of parameters, even beyond the optimal window. Additionally, the researchers found that the degree of subdivision affects the magnitude of the optimal speedup and the width of the parameter range over which it occurs.

The study's results also apply to the case of a population connected by migration to one or several smaller islands. The researchers demonstrated that subdivision with migration alone can significantly accelerate the crossing of fitness valleys and plateaus, shedding light on the quantitative conditions necessary for this to occur. The study's findings have implications for understanding how populations adapt to their environments and may help in inferring the structure of fitness landscapes from evolution experiments.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the primary vector for dengue, Zika, chikungunya, and yellow fever viruses. They used high-resolution mass spectrometry to examine the metabolic changes that occur in the midgut tissue after dengue virus infection. The midgut is the primary site of infection and replication, and the metabolic environment within this tissue plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to replicate and disseminate.

The study found that dengue virus infection leads to a dynamic remodeling of lipids in the midgut, including an increase in glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and fatty acyls. This lipid remodeling is coincident with the kinetics of viral replication. The researchers also observed an elevation of glycerolipid levels, suggesting a diversion of resources from energy storage to synthetic pathways. Additionally, they identified a central hub in the sphingolipid pathway that influences dihydroceramide to ceramide ratios, which is critical for the virus life cycle.

This study provides the first insight into the metabolic environment induced during arbovirus replication in Aedes aegypti. The findings highlight biochemical choke points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by these mosquitoes. The study also reconstructed the sphingolipid pathway in Aedes aegypti, which could have implications for understanding the replication mechanisms of several flaviviruses transmitted by this vector.
Researchers have developed a new, simplified model of the rabbit heart's electrical activity, known as the action potential (AP). This model, called a "parsimonious" model, uses fewer parameters than existing models and is based on data from the same species under physiological conditions. The new model combines a novel formulation of the rapid sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization, similar to the rectifying potassium current (IK). The model was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit myocytes, including dynamic current-voltage relationships, rapid recovery of AP excitability, and steady-state INa inactivation. Simulations using the model reproduced several important phenomena, including cellular alternans at high heart rates, reentrant spiral waves, and spiral wave breakup. The study found that the minimal requirements for these phenomena are the kinetics of INa inactivation and the non-linear rectification of IK. The simplicity and physiological relevance of the model make it a useful tool for understanding the underlying mechanisms of fatal cardiac arrhythmias. The model can also serve as a building block for more detailed ionic models to represent complex rabbit electrophysiology.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the complex process of genome assembly in the ciliate Paramecium. During its sexual cycle, Paramecium's genome undergoes precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding sequences called Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs). These excisions are initiated by DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that depend on a domesticated transposase called PiggyMac. However, the molecular steps involved in the final assembly of somatic genes had remained unknown. Researchers have now discovered that Ligase IV and Xrcc4p, core components of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, are essential for the repair of IES excision sites and the circularization of excised IESs. The transcription of LIG4 and XRCC4 is induced early in the sexual cycle, and a Lig4p-GFP fusion protein accumulates in the developing somatic nucleus by the time IES excision takes place. RNAi-mediated silencing of either gene results in the persistence of free broken DNA ends. The researchers found that the Lig4p-Xrcc4p complex carries out DSB repair during developmentally programmed IES excision in Paramecium, and that end joining is highly precise at the nucleotide level. This precision is critical for the assembly of functional open reading frames in the somatic genome. The study provides strong evidence that the NHEJ pathway has cooperated with domesticated transposases for the emergence of new mechanisms involved in genome dynamics.
A recent study analyzed the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas heart disease, comparing it to non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. The study used data from the REMADHE trial, which included 342 patients. The results showed that 185 patients (54.1%) died, with 56.4% of deaths occurring in Chagas patients and 53.7% in non-Chagas patients. The study found that the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality and heart failure mortality was significantly higher in Chagas patients compared to non-Chagas patients. However, there was no difference in the cumulative incidence of sudden death mortality between the two groups.

The study used Cox regression models to identify factors associated with heart failure and sudden death mortality. The results showed that Chagas etiology, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, creatinine clearance, and the use of amiodarone were independently associated with heart failure mortality, while left ventricular end-diastolic diameter and the use of beta-blockers were independently associated with sudden death mortality. The study concluded that in severe Chagas heart disease, progressive heart failure is the most important mode of death. These findings challenge the current understanding of Chagas heart disease and may have implications for the selection of treatment choices, considering the mode of death.
Scientists have discovered a new way that plant cells defend against a type of virus called a geminivirus. This defense mechanism involves a protein called NIK1, which interacts with a ribosomal protein called rpL10A. When NIK1 is activated, it phosphorylates rpL10A, causing it to move from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of the plant cell. This movement is crucial for the plant's defense against the virus, as it prevents the virus from replicating and spreading.

However, the virus has a way to counter this defense mechanism. The virus produces a protein called NSP, which binds to NIK1 and prevents it from phosphorylating rpL10A. As a result, rpL10A remains in the cytoplasm, allowing the virus to replicate and spread more easily. This interaction between NIK1, rpL10A, and NSP is a key part of the plant-virus interaction, and understanding it can help scientists develop new ways to protect plants from geminivirus infections.

Research has shown that the NIK1-mediated defense pathway is not the same as other known plant defense mechanisms, such as RNA silencing or the hypersensitive response. Instead, it involves the inhibition of plant growth and development. While the virus can overcome this defense mechanism in Arabidopsis plants, it may not be able to do so in other plant species, suggesting that the NIK1-mediated pathway could be a useful target for developing new antiviral strategies.
Researchers studied the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which causes a serious lung infection in humans. They found that AOX helps the fungus survive inside the host by protecting it from oxidative stress caused by the immune system. To test this, they created a strain of the fungus with reduced AOX expression and compared it to a normal strain. When exposed to immune cells called alveolar macrophages, the fungus with reduced AOX expression was less able to survive. In a mouse model of infection, the fungus with reduced AOX expression caused a lower fungal burden in the lungs and increased the survival rate of the mice. This suggests that AOX is important for the fungus's ability to cause infection. The researchers also found that when exposed to hydrogen peroxide, a molecule that causes oxidative stress, the fungus with normal AOX expression was more able to survive than the fungus with reduced AOX expression. This further supports the idea that AOX helps the fungus protect itself from oxidative stress. Overall, the study shows that AOX plays a key role in the fungus's ability to cause infection and survive inside the host.
Researchers investigated the role of attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, specifically in the CA3 region, in supporting episodic-like memory. They tested whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells by morphing one familiar context into another while observing the responses of CA3 cell ensembles. The results showed that average population activity in CA3 transitioned gradually rather than abruptly from one familiar context to the next, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with the two stored representations. However, individual CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along the morph sequence, and some displayed hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics.

A neural network model of the CA3 with attractors for both position and discrete contexts was developed to understand the seemingly conflicting results. The model found that for memories stored in overlapping neural ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent context attractors made transitions at different points along the morph sequence. This resulted in smooth transition curves when averaging across the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single unit level. In contrast, orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and single unit levels, similar to what was experimentally observed when remapping between two independent spatial maps. The results suggest that context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping local attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells, and similar mechanisms may be found in other regions of the cerebral cortex.
Entamoeba histolytica, a parasite that causes amebic colitis and abscesses in millions of people, has a unique way of responding to oxidative stress. When exposed to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, the parasite's metabolism changes dramatically. Researchers used a technique called capillary electrophoresis and mass spectrometry to study the metabolic responses of E. histolytica to oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide and paraquat. They found that the parasite's glycolysis, the process of breaking down glucose for energy, was inhibited due to the inactivation of key enzymes. As a result, the parasite redirected its metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. The researchers also discovered a functional glycerol biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica, which was previously unknown. This pathway was activated in response to oxidative stress, producing glycerol 3-phosphate and glycerol. The study suggests that the glycerol biosynthetic pathway may serve as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E. histolytica, helping the parasite to cope with oxidative stress. These findings provide new insights into the metabolic responses of E. histolytica to oxidative stress and may have implications for the development of new treatments for amebic colitis and abscesses.
A protein called IKAROS plays a crucial role in the development of blood cells, known as hematopoiesis. To understand how IKAROS works, researchers studied its interactions with other proteins in the cell. They found that IKAROS teams up with a complex called NuRD, which helps to reorganize the structure of DNA, and another complex called P-TEFb, which helps to extend the process of transcription, or gene expression. The researchers discovered that IKAROS recruits the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to specific genes, allowing them to be expressed. They also found that the level of IKAROS protein in the cell influences the recruitment of the NuRD-P-TEFb complex to these genes, and that this process is necessary for the proper development of blood cells. Furthermore, the researchers showed that IKAROS interacts with a protein called PP1, which helps to activate the P-TEFb complex, and that this interaction is necessary for the proper development of blood cells. The study suggests that IKAROS is a key player in the regulation of gene expression during hematopoiesis, and that its interactions with other proteins are crucial for the proper development of blood cells. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying hematopoiesis and may have implications for the development of new treatments for blood-related disorders.
Researchers studied the evolution and spread of rabies viruses in Trinidad, a Caribbean island, to understand the source of periodic outbreaks in the local livestock population. They analyzed genetic data from rabies virus samples collected between 1997 and 2010 and found that the viruses were closely related to those found in vampire bats. The data revealed three distinct lineages of the virus, designated as Trinidad I, IIa, and IIb, which likely originated from separate introductions from the South American mainland. The study suggests that the virus was introduced to the island on multiple occasions, with the most recent introduction occurring around 2010. The researchers also found evidence of co-circulation of two of the lineages, Trinidad I and IIa, in 2000. The study's findings indicate that vampire bats are the likely source of the rabies virus in Trinidad, and further research is needed to understand the relationship between the virus's spread and the ecology of vampire bat populations. The study's results also suggest that the virus may be introduced to the island through bats that migrate from nearby countries, such as Venezuela or Guyana, rather than just from Brazil and Uruguay as previously thought.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how genes regulate the development of distinct areas in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The model focuses on five genes: Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tfi, and Sp8, which play a crucial role in specifying area identity along the anterior-posterior axis. The model treats gene expression levels as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative nature of current experimental data. By simulating all possible networks containing these five genes, the researchers found that only a small fraction of networks could reproduce the experimentally observed expression patterns. These successful networks lacked certain interactions, such as auto-regulation and inductive loops. The analysis revealed that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive ones, but mutually repressive loops are not essential for correct network functioning. The model suggests that Fgf8 expression at the anterior pole can drive the correct spatial patterning of other transcription factors if simple interactions exist between them. The study provides insights into the design principles of the gene network regulating cortical area development and makes predictions that can be tested experimentally. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the regulatory interactions between genes in the development of the cerebral cortex.
Scientists have studied how a group of proteins called Polycomb group (PcG) proteins control the development of living organisms by regulating the expression of certain genes. These proteins work by adding chemical marks to histone proteins, which DNA wraps around, to either activate or repress gene expression. One of these marks, called H3K27, has been well-studied, but another mark, called uH2A, has received less attention. Researchers used a technique called ChIP-Seq to study the genome-wide distribution of uH2A in mouse cells. They found that uH2A is deposited by a protein called Bmi1, which is a key component of the PcG protein complex. The study revealed that uH2A is enriched at the promoters of genes that are repressed, or turned off, and that these genes have lower levels of expression compared to genes without uH2A. The researchers also found that genes with high levels of uH2A at their promoters have increased expression when Bmi1 is knocked out, suggesting that Bmi1-dependent uH2A plays a role in repressing gene expression. Furthermore, the study found that uH2A is not limited to regions with the H3K27 mark and is also enriched at high-density CpG promoters, which are associated with DNA methylation. This suggests that DNA methylation may be linked to uH2A at these regions. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of uH2A in gene regulation and its relationship with other epigenetic marks.
Researchers have identified a noncoding RNA called pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) that plays a crucial role in regulating the development of mammary epithelial cells in the mammary gland. During pregnancy, PINC is highly expressed in alveolar cells, which are responsible for producing milk. However, as the mammary gland prepares for lactation, PINC levels decrease, allowing alveolar cells to undergo terminal differentiation and produce milk proteins. The researchers found that overexpressing PINC in mammary epithelial cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knocking down PINC enhances differentiation. This suggests that PINC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy to prevent excessive milk production until parturition. Additionally, PINC interacts with a complex called polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which is involved in epigenetic modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alveolar fate in the involuted gland. The study suggests that PINC and PRC2 work together to regulate the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the mammary gland, ensuring that alveolar cells remain in an undifferentiated state until they are needed to produce milk during lactation.
Researchers have found that a protein called PML, also known as TRIM19, plays a crucial role in defending cells against retroviruses, including HIV-1. When HIV-1 infects a cell, PML quickly moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, forming structures called PML cytoplasmic bodies. This movement is triggered by the virus's reverse-transcription process, which is an early step in the virus's replication cycle. The researchers found that PML's movement is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors, suggesting that it is specifically triggered by retroviral reverse-transcription.

PML's role in defending against retroviruses is not direct, but rather through its interaction with another protein called Daxx. Daxx is found in the vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse-transcription, preventing the virus from replicating. The researchers also found that Daxx can inhibit not only exogenous retroviruses but also endogenous retroviruses, making it a broad cellular inhibitor of reverse-transcription.

The study suggests that PML and Daxx work together to defend against retroviruses, with PML triggering the movement of Daxx to the cytoplasm, where it can inhibit reverse-transcription. The researchers found that knocking down PML or Daxx increases the efficiency of retroviral infection, while overexpressing Daxx inhibits HIV-1 transduction. This study provides new insights into the role of PML and Daxx in defending against retroviruses and highlights their potential as targets for antiviral therapies.
Researchers have developed a new program, Matt, to improve protein multiple structure alignment, a crucial step in understanding protein function and evolution. The program, Multiple Alignment with Translations and Twists, uses a technique called aligned fragment pair chaining, where short structural fragments from proteins are aligned optimally and then chained together in geometrically consistent ways. Unlike previous methods, Matt allows for local flexibility between fragments, enabling small translations and rotations to bring aligned fragments closer, even if they are physically impossible under rigid body transformations. This flexibility helps to better model protein structures in various contexts.

Matt was tested against other recent multiple protein structure alignment programs on two benchmark datasets, Homstrad and SABmark. On Homstrad, a dataset of highly homologous proteins, Matt's performance was competitive with other programs. However, on SABmark, a dataset of proteins with more distant homology, Matt outperformed other programs, particularly in aligning the ends of alpha-helices and beta-strands. These results suggest that Matt's ability to model proteins in different conformational states and backbone distortions contributes to its strong performance.

The researchers also explored whether Matt's alignments can be used to distinguish between distantly homologous structure pairs and non-homologous protein structures. They found that a p-value score based on the length of the common core and average root mean squared deviation (RMSD) of Matt alignments can effectively separate decoys from homologous protein structures in the SABmark dataset.
Researchers studied how cells exit mitosis, the final stage of cell division. They found that two enzymes, PP2A/B55 and Fcp1, play a crucial role in this process. PP2A/B55 is a phosphatase that counteracts the activity of Cdk1, an enzyme that triggers mitosis. Greatwall kinase (Gwl) inactivates PP2A/B55 by phosphorylating its substrates Ensa and ARPP19. However, the regulation of Gwl activity and the phosphatases that control it were not well understood.

The researchers used a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments to study the dynamics of Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrate phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit. They found that PP2A/B55 is required for the dephosphorylation of Gwl at a specific site, and that Fcp1 is responsible for the dephosphorylation of Ensa/ARPP19. Surprisingly, inhibiting or depleting Fcp1 or PP2A did not block the dephosphorylation of most Cdk1 substrates during mitotic exit.

The study suggests that a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinates the dephosphorylation of Gwl, Ensa/ARPP19, and Cdk substrates during mitotic exit. The researchers also found that PP2A/B55 is primarily responsible for inactivating Gwl, but other phosphatases also contribute to its inactivation. The study provides new insights into the regulation of mitotic exit and the role of phosphatases in this process.
Researchers studied how the human immune system's neutralizing antibodies (Nab) respond to the HIV-1 virus during the early stages of infection. Neutralizing antibodies are proteins that can limit the virus's ability to replicate and establish a new infection. The study focused on subtype C HIV-1, which is prevalent in many parts of the world. Two individuals with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies, but the virus was still able to escape the immune response. The researchers identified multiple pathways that the virus used to evade the neutralizing antibodies. In one individual, the virus mutated in the V3V5 region of the envelope protein, while in the other individual, the virus mutated in the V1V2 region. The study found that the virus used different strategies to evade the neutralizing antibodies, including changes in the glycosylation of the envelope protein, direct alteration of the epitope sequence, and cooperative domain conformational masking. These findings suggest that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and that multiple strategies are used to evade neutralization. The study's results have implications for the development of an effective HIV vaccine, which aims to elicit neutralizing antibodies that can limit the replication of genetically diverse viruses and prevent the establishment of a new infection.
Researchers studied the genomes of 13 individuals from the plant species Capsella grandiflora to understand how positive and negative selection vary across different parts of the genome. They found that selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most noncoding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). However, when looking at noncoding regions that are conserved across the Brassicaceae family, they found strong signals of selection. The study also showed that genes with higher expression levels experience stronger negative selection, but similar levels of positive selection as genes with lower expression levels. This suggests that both positive and negative selection are widespread in coding and regulatory regions of the plant genome. However, the study found that positive and negative selection on noncoding sequences in plants are less common than in animal genomes. The researchers identified conserved noncoding sequences (CNSs) across nine Brassicaceae genomes and found that a large proportion of noncoding DNA may evolve neutrally. The study's findings have implications for understanding genome function and the maintenance of genetic variation in plants. The results suggest that regulatory evolution in plants may occur more often through gene duplication than cis-regulatory change, leading to lower levels of functional constraint and positive selection on plant noncoding DNA.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transforms resting B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can lead to malignancies. EBV-encoded transcriptional regulator EBNA2 plays a key role in this process by driving the formation of new binding sites for two master regulators of B-cell fate, RBP-jκ and EBF1. Unlike previous studies, which suggested that these factors are statically bound to target gene promoters, EBNA2 induces the formation of new binding sites for both RBP-jκ and EBF1, many of which are in close physical proximity in the cellular and viral genome. These newly induced binding sites co-occupied by EBNA2-EBF1-RBP-jκ correlate strongly with the transcriptional activation of linked genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EBNA2 leads to a rapid alteration in RBP-jκ and EBF1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA depletion studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EBNA2 facilitates combinatorial interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary to drive B-lymphoblast growth and survival. EBV type III latency promotes a B-cell marginal zone developmental program, as the number of RBP-jκ binding sites is largely increased. EBNA2 colocalizes with EBF1 and RBP-jκ at many enhancer and super-enhancer regions in EBV-positive lymphoblastoid cell lines. EBNA2 is a potent transcriptional co-activator that is expressed in early stages of EBV-induced proliferation of naïve B-cells, but its expression is extinguished at later stages of B-cell development.
Aedes aegypti, the primary mosquito vector of dengue virus, exhibits significant genetic structure and variation in its ability to transmit the virus in Mexico. Research has shown that the Neovolcanic axis (NVA), which intersects the Gulf of Mexico coast in the state of Veracruz, acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae. aegypti populations north and south of the NVA. This barrier is associated with differences in vector competence (VC) for dengue serotype 2 virus (DENV2). Mosquitoes from populations north of the NVA have an average VC rate of 0.55, while those from populations south of the NVA have an average VC rate of 0.20. Most of this variation is due to midgut infection and escape barriers, with 21.5% of mosquitoes from north of the NVA failing to develop midgut infections and 30.3% of those with an infected midgut failing to develop a disseminated infection. In contrast, 45.2% of mosquitoes from south of the NVA failed to develop midgut infections and 62.8% of those with an infected midgut failed to develop a disseminated infection. These findings suggest that the NVA may impact the frequency of genes that condition continuous and epidemiologically relevant traits such as VC. Further studies are needed to determine why the NVA is a barrier to gene flow and to confirm whether the differences in VC are stable and epidemiologically significant.
Researchers have investigated the role of the DnaA protein in the initiation of DNA replication in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells. The DnaA protein cycles between an active ATP-bound form and an inactive ADP-bound form, and it has been suggested that it is the main controller of initiation frequency. However, the study found that increasing the concentration of ATP-DnaA by more than 50% did not affect the timing of replication initiation. This suggests that the DnaA protein is not the limiting factor for the precise timing of initiation.

The researchers propose that the E. coli cell cycle is driven by the cycling of ATP-DnaA and ADP-DnaA levels, and that initiation of replication cannot occur unless sufficient amounts of ATP-DnaA are present at the origin of replication (oriC). However, the timing of initiation is controlled by signals from the cell's environment, rather than by the amount of ATP-DnaA.

The study also investigated the roles of two other factors, DDAH (DnaA-dependent DnaA inactivation) and DiaA (DnaA-binding protein). Loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein. The results indicate that compromised cell cycle machinery performs in a less robust manner.

Overall, the study suggests that the DnaA protein is the motor that drives the initiation process, but other factors are required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment.
Researchers have developed a new approach called partial Granger causality to study interactions in biological systems. This method can identify patterns in multivariate data with external inputs and hidden variables in the frequency domain. The approach was tested with simulated data and applied to real-world datasets, including gene expression data from cancer cells, brain activity recordings from a sheep's brain, and recordings from a monkey's brain while it performed a visual task. The results showed that traditional methods of analyzing causality can be misleading, especially when dealing with external inputs and hidden variables. The new approach, partial Granger causality, provides a more accurate picture of interactions in the frequency domain. This method is based on a well-understood statistical concept, the conditional variance, and can handle external inputs and hidden variables. The researchers used a toy model to demonstrate the frequency decomposition of partial Granger causality and showed that it can be applied to real-world data. The study highlights the importance of considering external inputs and hidden variables when analyzing causality in biological systems. The new approach has the potential to improve our understanding of complex biological processes and can be applied to various fields, including neuroscience and genomics.
Researchers have developed new methods for determining an individual's ancestry at specific locations in their genome, known as local ancestry inference. This is crucial for medical and population genetic studies, as it can help identify disease-risk loci, infer recombination rates, and map missing contigs in the human genome. However, existing methods for local ancestry inference are often designed for use with genotyping arrays and fail to utilize the full spectrum of data available from sequencing.

The new approach, called Lanc-CSV, leverages continent-specific variants (CSVs) to improve performance over existing methods in sequenced admixed genomes. It incorporates both the admixed genomes themselves and public datasets, such as the 1000 Genomes project, to enhance the accuracy of CSV calling. Simulations show that Lanc-CSV achieves accuracy comparable to computationally intensive haplotype-based approaches, but with significantly reduced runtime.

The method also accounts for low-coverage sequencing and can accurately infer local ancestry at low sequencing coverage. Additionally, the researchers extended the concept of CSVs to sub-continental population-specific variants (sCSVs), which can be used to determine sub-continental ancestry for short chromosomal segments. This approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of local ancestry inference, particularly as the cost of sequencing continues to decrease and genetic studies sequence more samples.
Researchers have found that almost all genes in mammals exhibit a daily oscillation in their expression levels, contrary to previous estimates of 10-15% of genes. This discovery was made possible by applying digital signal processing algorithms to large datasets of gene expression profiles. By analyzing each group of genes that oscillate in the same phase separately, the researchers were able to identify circadian baseline oscillation in nearly 100% of all expressed genes. This finding suggests that oscillation is a natural and important feature of all or nearly all biological pathways.

The researchers used digital signal processing to reduce noise and enhance the signal in the gene expression data, allowing them to identify patterns of circadian oscillation with confidence. They found that genes that display daily variation in their expression levels may or may not be directly linked to the circadian molecular clock, but the oscillation of these genes and their encoded protein products will affect all elements of the system as a whole.

The study highlights the importance of considering circadian oscillation in gene expression when studying biological pathways. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations or environmental factors, such as photic stimuli or feeding, should be evaluated in the context of changes in the amplitude and phase of genetic oscillations. The findings of this study suggest that circadian oscillation is a fundamental aspect of mammalian biology and should be taken into account in any study related to biological pathways.
Researchers used whole-genome re-sequencing to study recombination events in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers. They identified 325 crossover events at a median resolution of 1.4 kilobases, with 86% of events localized to regions less than 10 kilobases. Crossover rates were higher in males (3.56 centimorgans per megabase) than in females (2.28 centimorgans per megabase) and increased towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed in the genome, with distinct hotspots and a concentration in genic regions, particularly in promoters and CpG islands.

The researchers also identified 267 non-crossover gene conversion events, which were significantly associated with crossover locations. They found a transmission bias in favor of "strong" (G, C) alleles over "weak" (A, T) alleles at non-crossover events, providing evidence for GC-biased gene conversion in the avian system. The study's approach can be applied to other species, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the recombination landscape across different organisms. The findings suggest that recombination events are often concentrated in specific genomic regions, known as hotspots, and that these hotspots may remain relatively stable over time in the absence of an active Prdm9 gene.
Researchers have studied the folding behavior of repeat-proteins, which are made up of repeated 20- to 40-amino acid stretches. These proteins typically fold into elongated, non-globular structures, stabilized by interactions within and between repeats, but lacking contacts between distant residues. The inherent symmetries of repeat-proteins can be analyzed as a one-dimensional problem, allowing for a simplified description of their energy landscapes.

A formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, treated as spin variables, provides a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes. This model implies simple relations for experimental observables, such as folding free-energy and cooperativity of denaturation, which do not apply to globular proteins. The parameters for the "coarse-grained" description can be extracted from detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes.

A case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins illustrates the ideas, and the results are quantitatively related to experimentally observed folding transitions. The study suggests that natural repeat proteins are "poised" at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics, allowing them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions. The research provides a framework for understanding the folding behavior of repeat-proteins and its relation to their biological functions.
Researchers investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer. They found that CHOP is overexpressed in human HCC tumors and in two mouse models of the disease. Mice lacking the CHOP gene (Chop-null mice) were resistant to liver cancer and fibrosis, a condition that increases the risk of HCC. These mice also showed reduced levels of inflammatory signaling in the liver. The study suggests that CHOP promotes liver cancer by contributing to inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. The researchers propose that CHOP plays a key role in the development of HCC in various chronic liver diseases, including viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. They also found that CHOP expression is associated with an agent that causes hepatocyte injury and is upstream of the activation of fibrosis. The study's findings place CHOP upstream of both fibrosis and tumorigenesis, suggesting that the progression from CHOP expression to liver tumors occurs in a stepwise fashion. The researchers believe that understanding how CHOP promotes oncogenesis will have implications for other cancers beyond HCC and suggest additional points for potential therapeutic intervention. Overall, the study reveals a molecular link between hepatocarcinogenesis and the stimuli that predispose to it, and highlights the importance of CHOP in the development of HCC.
A systematic review of clinical studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethiopica was conducted to identify potentially effective medications. The review included 24 records reporting on 506 treatment episodes of CL, mostly from Ethiopia. The most commonly used treatments were antimonials, pentamidine, and cryotherapy. However, the quality of the studies was poor, and only two small randomized controlled trials were identified, both conducted long ago. The review found that cryotherapy had a cure rate of 60-80%, while antimonials had a cure rate of 69-85%. Pentamidine was effective against complicated CL, including cases that did not respond to antimonials. However, all studies had methodological limitations. Data on miltefosine, paromomycin, and liposomal amphotericin B were scarce, and only a few studies focused on diffuse CL (DCL). The review concluded that the evidence base for treating complicated CL caused by L. aethiopica is extremely limited. Antimonials remain the most available treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety need to be better defined. Alternative first-line treatments, such as miltefosine or paromomycin, should be explored. High-quality trials are urgently needed to evaluate treatment options for CL caused by L. aethiopica.
Researchers have successfully recreated a circadian clockwork in a laboratory setting using three purified proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. This in vitro oscillator displays the key characteristics of natural circadian rhythms, including a 24-hour cycle that remains consistent even when the temperature changes. To understand how this oscillator works, the researchers used electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis to study the interactions between the three proteins over time. They found that the proteins form different complexes at various stages of the circadian cycle, with the composition of these complexes changing over the 24-hour period.

A dynamic model was developed based on these findings, which accurately predicts the rhythms of the KaiABC complexes and the phosphorylation of KaiC. The model suggests that the exchange of monomers among KaiC hexamers helps maintain synchrony among the hexamers, allowing the oscillator to sustain a high-amplitude oscillation over multiple days. To test this idea, the researchers used a technique called fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) to confirm that monomer exchange occurs among KaiC hexamers.

The researchers also used temperature pulses to reset the phase of the oscillator, demonstrating that this unique circadian oscillator can be reset by stimuli that are known to entrain natural circadian clocks. This study provides a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the circadian clockwork, shedding light on the intricate interactions between the Kai proteins.
Researchers investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual stimulus detection task. They used electrocorticography (ECoG) to record brain activity from patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment. The study found an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. This means that when the raw fluctuation in broadband ECoG activity is closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate is higher and reaction times are faster. This relationship was observed not only in post-stimulus task-evoked brain activity but also in pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting that anticipatory brain dynamics play a role. The findings support the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and are consistent with attractor network theories, which propose that the brain settles into a more confined state space under task performance. The proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance. The study decouples variability reduction from trial-averaged activity, predicting a U- or inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral performance. The results have implications for our understanding of brain function and behavior.
Researchers studied the mating-type loci in 24 species of Trichosporonales, a group of fungi closely related to the pathogenic Cryptococcus species. They found that the mating-type loci in these species are fused, similar to those in the pathogenic Cryptococci. However, the gene content and gene order within the fused loci are highly conserved in the Trichosporonales, unlike in other fungal groups. This suggests that the fusion of the mating-type loci occurred independently in the Trichosporonales and the pathogenic Cryptococci, supporting the idea of convergent evolution. Convergent evolution is when different species develop similar traits independently of each other. In this case, the fusion of the mating-type loci in the Trichosporonales and the pathogenic Cryptococci is an example of convergent evolution. The researchers also found that there is no apparent suppression of recombination extending from the mating-type loci to adjacent chromosomal regions in the Trichosporonales, which is different from other fungal groups. This suggests that the mechanisms underlying the evolution of fused mating-type loci in the Trichosporonales are unique. The study provides new insights into the evolution of mating-type loci in fungi and highlights the importance of studying the evolution of genomic regions involved in mating and mating-type determination.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to predict the abundance of non-domiciliated Triatoma dimidiata, a vector of Chagas disease, in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. The model was based on two years of field data and accurately predicted the abundance of the vector in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. The study found that pyrethroid spraying was effective in reducing bug abundance by 80% when applied at a dose of 50 mg/m2 yearly within a two-month period matching the immigration season. However, larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve the reduction in bug abundance, and it decreased drastically for different timing and lower frequencies of intervention. In contrast, the use of insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to the reduction of the vector immigration rate. The study suggests that control of non-domiciliated vectors can hardly be achieved by insecticide spraying due to the need for yearly application and accurate understanding of the temporal pattern of immigration. Insect screens appear to offer an effective and sustainable alternative for controlling non-domiciliated vectors, which may be part of multi-disease interventions for the integrated control of neglected vector-borne diseases.
Scientists have discovered how feathers are arranged in a precise pattern on birds' skin. During development, feathers first appear in a row along the middle of the back, with new feather buds added in a wave-like pattern. This patterning relies on two types of signals: fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). These signals work together with the movement of cells in the skin to create a coordinated reaction-diffusion-taxis system. This system involves a positive feedback loop where the FGF signal induces cell aggregation, which in turn compresses the skin and intensifies the FGF signal. This process creates a wave of feather formation that spreads across the skin. The Ectodysplasin A (EDA) signal initiates this wave by triggering the expression of FGF20. The EDA signal also creates a gradient of mesenchymal cell density, which determines where feathers will form. In birds that cannot fly, such as the ostrich and emu, this patterning system is disrupted, resulting in abnormal feather arrangements. The researchers found that the absence of FGF20 in the scaleless mutant prevents feather primordium formation, highlighting the importance of the epidermis in avian skin patterning. The study shows that a reaction-diffusion-taxis system, integrated with mechanical processes, generates the precise pattern of feathers on birds' skin.
A rapid systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors was conducted. The review aimed to identify primary data suggesting a high likelihood of actively infectious filovirus in human body fluids. Eligible infections included Marburg virus and Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest, and Bundibugyo species of Ebola. A total of 6831 unique articles were found, and 33 studies were eligible for inclusion.

The review found that for most body fluid types, there were insufficient patients to draw strong conclusions, and the prevalence of positivity was highly variable. Body fluids taken more than 16 days after onset were usually negative. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for filovirus RNA gave positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluid, but not in every sample from every otherwise confirmed patient.

The review suggests that contact with blood and blood-stained body fluids remains the major risk for disease transmission due to the known high viral loads in blood. Non-blood, RT-PCR positive samples are likely to be culture negative and possibly of low infectious risk. However, it is unclear how relatively infectious many body fluids are during or after illness, even when culture-positive, as most test results come from more severe cases.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model, called the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model, to describe the behavior of neurons in the brain. This model takes into account the complex interactions between different parts of the neuron's membrane, which can lead to power-law behavior and non-Markovian processes. The model uses a fractional derivative, which is a mathematical concept that describes a non-local process where the value of a variable is determined by integrating a weighted voltage trace, or memory trace, of the past.

The model can reproduce the observed spike timing adaptations in neocortical pyramidal cells and tectal neurons in vitro, including upward and downward spike adaptations, longer first-spike latency, and high inter-spike variability with a power-law distribution. The model also generates reliable spike patterns in response to noisy input. The fractional model deviates from the traditional Markovian model and reflects the temporal accumulated intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect the response of the neuron to external stimulation.

The model is a unified framework that can be used to describe power-law dynamics and long-range correlations in neuronal activity. It can capture relationships between the distribution of conductances that are complicated to model using explicit techniques. The model provides a general way to simplify the complicated details shown in other models and exhibits spike adaptation with power-law dynamics by integrating all the past voltage values without any additional adaptation currents.
Researchers have identified six superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in the fungus Paracoccidioides, which helps it defend against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the host's immune cells. To study the role of these SODs, the researchers analyzed gene expression levels in different stages of the fungus's life cycle, including yeast and mycelia forms, and under various conditions such as exposure to oxidative agents and interaction with immune cells. They found that two specific SODs, PbSOD1 and PbSOD3, were highly expressed during the transition from yeast to mycelia, exposure to oxidative agents, and interaction with immune cells, suggesting they play a crucial role in combating ROS. The researchers also found that PbSOD1 and PbSOD3 are involved in the fungus's response to oxidative stress and host effector cells, and that PbSOD3 has a pronounced extracellular activity, while PbSOD1 is more related to intracellular requirements. The study suggests that Paracoccidioides actively responds to endogenously generated ROS and counteracts the oxidative burst of immune cells by inducing the expression of SOD isoforms. The findings provide new insights into the antioxidant response of Paracoccidioides and its ability to adapt to oxidative stress, which is essential for its survival and pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaperone binding in various species, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa. They analyzed high-throughput interaction data to determine if predicted disorder correlates with chaperone binding. The study found that predicted disorder actually shows a negative correlation with chaperone binding, meaning that IDPs tend to avoid being bound to chaperones. This effect is observed in all three taxonomic groups studied. The researchers also found that the presence of ordered domains, such as Pfam domains, is associated with chaperone binding, suggesting that chaperones are primarily required for folding of globular proteins. In contrast, IDPs that bind chaperones tend to bind other proteins as well, suggesting that chaperone binding promotes assembly with partners rather than assisting with folding. The study also found that IDPs that bind chaperones are more likely to bind other proteins than ordered proteins. Overall, the results suggest that chaperone binding is not primarily used to protect IDPs from degradation, but rather to facilitate their interactions with other proteins.
Researchers studied the role of two genes, spalt major (salm) and spalt-related (salr), in the development of the Drosophila melanogaster wing. These genes encode zinc-finger transcription factors that are regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway in the wing imaginal disc. The Dpp pathway is crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and vein patterning in the wing disc. To understand how salm and salr function, the researchers used microarray experiments to compare the expression profiles of salm/salr knockdown wing discs with control discs. They found that salm and salr regulate a complex landscape of gene expression in the wing disc, including both activated and repressed genes. The researchers identified candidate target genes of salm and salr and found that some of these genes are required for wing growth and patterning. This study provides new insights into the genetic hierarchy acting downstream of Dpp signaling in the wing disc and sheds light on the mechanisms by which salm and salr regulate transcription. The findings suggest that salm and salr play a central role in mediating the effects of Dpp signaling during wing disc development, and that their target genes are involved in various aspects of wing development, including cell survival, proliferation, and vein patterning.
Researchers have found that a protein called Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) plays a crucial role in regulating the number of centrioles in cells. Centrioles are essential for cell division and their proper number is critical for preventing diseases such as tumorigenesis and microcephaly. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, a protein called ZYG-1 is required for centriole duplication. However, the regulation of ZYG-1 levels was not well understood.

The study identified two PP1 orthologs, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators I-2SZY-2 and SDS-22 as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels. The researchers found that down-regulating PP1 activity either directly or by mutating szy-2 or sds-22 can rescue the loss of centriole duplication associated with a zyg-1 hypomorphic allele. This is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels, indicating that PP1 normally regulates ZYG-1 through a post-translational mechanism.

The study also found that moderate inhibition of PP1 activity can restore centriole duplication to a zyg-1 mutant, but strong inhibition of PP1 in a wild-type background leads to centriole amplification, resulting in the production of more than one daughter centriole. The results define a new pathway that limits the number of daughter centrioles produced each cycle. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of centriole duplication and the role of PP1 in this process.
A study was conducted in an environmentally protected area (EPA) in southeastern Brazil to investigate the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania. The area had previously reported cases of VL in dogs, and researchers wanted to understand the role of wildlife in the transmission of the disease. The study found that six species of sand flies, including the main vector in Brazil, Lutzomyia longipalpis, were present in the area. Two of these sand flies were found to be naturally infected with Leishmania. Additionally, two white-eared opossums, a known reservoir of VL, were found to be naturally infected with Leishmania. The study also found that dogs living in the area had a seroprevalence of 1.5% and 1.2% in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The proximity of infected animals, human residences, and forest areas suggests that the EPA has an active VL focus. The study highlights the risk of establishing and maintaining disease transmission foci in areas that undergo environmental modifications. The findings suggest that different epidemiological profiles of VL must be considered to develop effective prevention and control measures. The study's results provide evidence of a sylvatic Leishmania transmission cycle occurring in the EPA, but it was not possible to confirm whether VL in the area occurred due to a wild enzootic cycle of transmission.
Researchers have discovered that a small RNA molecule called miR-BART9, encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), plays a key role in promoting the spread of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly aggressive type of cancer. EBV is a common virus that can cause various diseases, including NPC, which is prevalent in South Asia. The study found that miR-BART9 is highly expressed in NPC tissues and promotes the migration and invasiveness of cancer cells. This is achieved by targeting a protein called E-cadherin, which is essential for maintaining cell-cell junctions and the epithelial phenotype. By inhibiting E-cadherin, miR-BART9 induces a mesenchymal-like phenotype in NPC cells, making them more motile and prone to metastasis. The study used gain- and loss-of-function approaches to investigate the effects of miR-BART9 in EBV-negative and EBV-positive NPC cells, confirming that miR-BART9 is a prometastatic viral miRNA. The findings suggest that high levels of miR-BART9 in EBV-positive NPC cells contribute to the aggressiveness of tumor cells. The study also found that miR-BART9 shares a similar "seed sequence" with the miR-200 family, which is down-regulated in NPC tumors, further supporting the role of miR-BART9 in promoting metastasis. Overall, the study highlights the importance of miR-BART9 in the development and progression of NPC, and its potential as a therapeutic target for the treatment of this aggressive cancer.
Researchers have developed a new command-line tool called ggsashimi for visualizing splicing events in RNA-seq data. This tool creates sashimi plots, a type of diagram that shows the presence of splice junctions between two splice sites, for individual experiments or groups of experiments. Unlike existing tools, ggsashimi is annotation-independent and can handle large genomic regions by scaling down the segments between splice sites. It uses popular bioinformatics file formats and is implemented in Python, generating R code for plotting.

The tool addresses limitations of current sashimi plot implementations, including the need for specialized annotation formats and the difficulty of visualizing splicing events in non-contiguous regions of the genome. Ggsashimi allows for the aggregation of samples from the same group and the shrinkage of intron lengths, making it easier to visualize splicing events. For comparison, the researchers used ggsashimi and the sashimi plot built-in to the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) to visualize a genomic region containing a splicing event.

Ggsashimi is freely available on GitHub and can be used for exploratory data analysis of RNA-seq data. The tool's ability to handle large datasets and provide summarized views for hundreds of samples makes it a valuable resource for researchers studying alternative splicing. By eliminating the need for specialized annotation formats, ggsashimi expands the application of sashimi plots for splicing visualization.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) in DNA sequences across different species. CRMs are regions of DNA that control gene expression, and understanding their evolution is crucial for understanding how genes are regulated. The new model, called EMMA, uses a probabilistic approach to account for the evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and background sequences. Unlike existing models, EMMA can handle the gain and loss of TFBSs, which is an important aspect of regulatory sequence evolution.

The EMMA model is based on a statistical alignment method that uses conserved TFBSs to improve alignment. It also treats the alignment and annotation of TFBSs as random variables, which helps to minimize the impact of uncertain alignment and annotation. The researchers tested EMMA on simulated and real data and found that it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods in aligning and predicting CRMs.

EMMA was also used to study the conservation of binding sites in genome-wide binding data of key transcription factors in Drosophila blastoderm. The results showed that factor-bound sequences are under strong evolutionary constraints, even if their neighboring genes are not expressed in the blastoderm. Additionally, binding sites in distal regions (far from the transcription start site) tend to be more conserved than those in proximal regions. The EMMA software is now available for use in a broad biological context.
Researchers have discovered that the piRNA pathway in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the genome and protecting telomeres. Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that prevent them from deteriorating or fusing with other chromosomes. The piRNA pathway is responsible for silencing transposons, which are mobile genetic elements that can jump from one location to another in the genome and disrupt its integrity.

Studies have shown that mutations in the piRNA pathway genes armi, aub, ago3, and rhi lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during embryonic development. Additionally, mutations in aub and armi disrupt telomere resolution during meiosis and the cleavage divisions, leading to chromosome fusions. However, mutations in lig-IV, which disrupt non-homologous end joining, suppress these fusions but enhance chromosome fragmentation.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies revealed that aub and armi mutations disrupt the binding of HOAP, a component of the telomere protection complex, and reduce the expression of a subpopulation of 19- to 22-nt telomere-specific piRNAs. In contrast, mutations in rhi and ago3 do not block HOAP binding or production of these piRNAs. These findings suggest that the piRNA pathway has distinct functions in genome maintenance and telomere protection, with aub and armi playing a crucial role in the assembly of the telomere protection complex.
A new strain of the Ebola virus, known as Bundibugyo ebolavirus, has been identified as the cause of a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in western Uganda. The outbreak, which occurred in November 2007, resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths, with a case fatality rate of approximately 36%. This new virus is most closely related to the Côte d'Ivoire ebolavirus, despite being found in a geographically distant region. The discovery of Bundibugyo ebolavirus has significant implications for the development of diagnostic tests, antiviral treatments, and vaccines. Current vaccines, which are based on the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, may not provide adequate protection against this new strain, highlighting the need for cross-protection studies. The pathogenicity of Bundibugyo ebolavirus is lower than that of the Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, with a case fatality rate of 36% compared to 80-90% and 50-55%, respectively. Further studies are needed to compare the pathogenicity of these viruses in non-human primates. The rapid identification and isolation of Ebola cases in the affected area were facilitated by the transfer of diagnostic assays to the Uganda Virus Research Institute, which helped to control the outbreak. The discovery of Bundibugyo ebolavirus underscores the importance of continued research and development of diagnostic tools and treatments for Ebola virus infections.
Researchers analyzed a large dataset of 648 Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years. They used the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging procedure (FAST) to categorize the patients into seven stages of AD, from normal aging to severe dementia. The researchers found that the duration of GDS/FAST stages 4-6 varied significantly among patients, with standard deviations comparable to their mean values. This indicates a high degree of heterogeneity in the progression of AD among patients. The study suggests that AD is not a uniform disease, but rather a collection of sub-groups with different patterns of decline. The findings are consistent with previous reports of variability in AD progression rates. The researchers used a 23-year-long longitudinal dataset, which provided a comprehensive representation of patients at various stages of AD. The study's results have implications for evaluating the outcomes of clinical studies and understanding the underlying factors contributing to the variability in AD progression rates.
Researchers developed a computer model of the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory formation, to study how it adapts to changing environments. The model included a process called additive neurogenesis, where new brain cells are added over time, and compared it to two other adaptation strategies: conventional synaptic plasticity, where connections between brain cells change, and neuronal turnover, where old brain cells die and are replaced. The study found that additive neurogenesis was the most effective strategy for adapting to changing environments. The researchers then added a more realistic input pattern to the model, mimicking the activity of grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, a part of the brain that sends signals to the hippocampus. They found that additive neurogenesis was still the best strategy for adapting to this new input pattern. The researchers also developed a more complex neurogenesis rule that incorporates cell death and enhanced plasticity of new brain cells and found that it performed better than any of the individual strategies alone. This rule can be tailored to optimize the model's performance as a short-term or long-term memory store. The study also explored how adult neurogenesis changes over an animal's lifetime under different hypothetical rearing conditions and found distinct growth profiles that could be tested experimentally. Finally, the researchers showed that place cells, a type of brain cell involved in navigation, can emerge and refine in the model as a result of the sparsification performed by the dentate gyrus layer.
African trypanosomes, a type of parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in cattle, have a unique way of protecting their lysosomes from damage caused by iron. Lysosomes are organelles that break down and recycle cellular waste, but they can be damaged by iron, leading to cell death. Researchers found that the parasite's cytosolic peroxidases, enzymes that detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides, play a crucial role in protecting the lysosome from iron-induced damage. The study showed that when these enzymes are absent, the lysosome is damaged, leading to rapid cell death. However, when the antioxidant Trolox is added to the medium, the lysosome is protected, and the cell survives. The researchers also found that the lysosome is the primary site of oxidative damage, not the mitochondrion, and that the parasite's high endocytic rate and distinct iron acquisition mechanisms contribute to its susceptibility to lysosomal damage. The study suggests that the cytosolic peroxidases are essential for the parasite's survival and that targeting these enzymes could be a potential strategy for developing new treatments for trypanosomiasis. The researchers also found that the mitochondrial peroxidase is not essential for the parasite's survival, and that the procyclic insect form of the parasite can survive without the cytosolic peroxidases. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of lysosomal damage and the role of cytosolic peroxidases in protecting the lysosome in African trypanosomes.
Researchers have inactivated the Pmel gene in mice to study its role in melanosome shape and pigmentation. Melanosomes are organelles in pigment cells where melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair color, is produced. The Pmel gene codes for a protein that forms amyloid fibrils within melanosomes, giving them their characteristic rod-like shape. In mice with the Pmel gene inactivated, melanosomes are spherical rather than rod-shaped, but this change has only a mild effect on visible pigmentation. The mice are viable, fertile, and show no obvious developmental defects. However, they do have reduced eumelanin content in their hair, indicating that Pmel plays a critical role in maintaining efficient epidermal pigmentation. The study suggests that other previously described alleles in vertebrates with more striking effects on pigmentation may be dominant-negative mutations rather than complete loss-of-function mutations. The findings provide new insights into the role of Pmel in melanosome development and pigmentation, and highlight the importance of this protein in maintaining normal melanin production. The study also raises questions about the potential functions of Pmel beyond its role in melanosome shape and pigmentation.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental methods for controlling the spread of dengue fever. Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The study focused on three environmental methods: using container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up campaigns, and eliminating breeding sites by making them unusable or removing them. The researchers analyzed 19 studies that met their eligibility criteria and found that all three methods showed some effectiveness in reducing the number of larvae and pupae of Aedes mosquitoes, the primary vectors of dengue fever. However, the study also found that the quality of the studies was a major issue, with most assessed as low or medium quality. The meta-analysis showed that container covers without insecticides and waste management with direct garbage collection were the most effective methods in reducing the Breteau index, a measure of mosquito breeding sites. On the other hand, container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places were the most effective in reducing the pupae per person index. The study suggests that environmental interventions can be an effective way to control the spread of dengue fever, but more high-quality studies are needed to strengthen the evidence.
Researchers have identified small molecules that selectively stall protein synthesis by the ribosome, which could lead to new treatments for diseases. These compounds, such as PF-06378503 (PF8503), inhibit the translation of PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and reduce LDL cholesterol in preclinical models. However, the effects of these compounds on cell physiology and ribosome quality control pathways are not well understood. To investigate this, a genome-wide CRISPRi screen was conducted to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of PF8503. The screen revealed that the ubiquitin binding protein ASCC2 and helicase ASCC3 bind to the ribosome and protect cells from the toxic effects of PF8503. In contrast, translation quality control proteins Pelota (PELO) and HBS1L sensitize cells to PF8503 treatment. Genetic interaction experiments showed that ASCC3 acts together with ASCC2 and functions downstream of HBS1L. These findings provide new insights into the selectivity of compounds that stall human translation and could aid the development of next-generation selective translation stalling compounds to treat disease. The study also found that PF8503 and a related compound, PF846, have similar potency in inhibiting PCSK9 but induce ribosome stalling on a surprisingly different array of off-target mRNAs.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) promotes the destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) to evade the immune system and block host gene expression. The virus achieves this through a protein called SOX, which does not have intrinsic ribonuclease activity. Instead, SOX stimulates a cellular process called polyadenylation, which adds a long tail of adenine nucleotides to the end of mRNA molecules. This aberrant polyadenylation leads to the destruction of the mRNA, preventing it from being translated into protein.

The study found that SOX-induced polyadenylation is linked to the activity of a cellular enzyme called poly(A) polymerase II, which adds the adenine nucleotides to the mRNA. The researchers also identified two cellular proteins, nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins, as essential cofactors for SOX function. These proteins play a crucial role in the polyadenylation process and are relocalized to the nucleus in the presence of SOX.

The study suggests that SOX-induced mRNA turnover is a novel mechanism of host shutoff and provides a new model system to study the regulation of poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. The findings have implications for our understanding of how viruses manipulate cellular processes to evade the immune system and block host gene expression.
Researchers have found that a type of interferon, called IFNλ, plays a crucial role in the body's response to bacterial infections in the lungs. IFNλ is a protein that helps to activate the immune system to fight off infections. In this study, scientists investigated how IFNλ affects the body's response to two types of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that when these bacteria infect the lungs, they trigger the production of IFNλ, which in turn helps to clear the bacteria from the lungs. However, this process also leads to inflammation, which can cause damage to the lungs.

The researchers discovered that IFNλ works by inhibiting the activity of a microRNA called miR-21, which normally suppresses the production of a protein called PDCD4. PDCD4 is involved in promoting inflammatory signaling, so when miR-21 is inhibited, PDCD4 is upregulated, leading to increased inflammation. The study found that mice lacking the receptor for IFNλ (IL-28R) or PDCD4 had improved clearance of the bacteria and less lung damage compared to normal mice. This suggests that IFNλ promotes inflammation in response to bacterial infections by inhibiting miR-21 and upregulating PDCD4. The findings of this study highlight the complex role of IFNλ in the body's response to bacterial infections and may have implications for the development of new treatments for respiratory infections.
Researchers in the Democratic Republic of Congo analyzed data from 781 patients with advanced stage-2 sleeping sickness, also known as Human African Trypanosomiasis, over a 23-year period from 1989 to 2012. The study aimed to identify mortality trends and risk factors associated with the disease. The researchers found that 17.2% of patients died in the standard melarsoprol treatment group, 12.1% in the short schedule melarsoprol group, 5.4% in the first-line eflornithine group, and 9.1% in the NECT (eflornithine and nifurtimox) treatment group. However, a higher death rate of 36% was observed in a group of severely affected patients who received eflornithine due to their clinical status on admission.

The study identified several risk factors associated with mortality, including clinical dysfunction on admission, high protidorachy, presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid, and high cytorachy. After adjusting for treatment, the researchers found that clinical dysfunction on admission was the strongest predictor of death, followed by high protidorachy and presence of parasites in the cerebrospinal fluid. A multivariable analysis within treatment groups confirmed that clinical status on admission and high protidorachy were significant predictors of death.

The study highlights the importance of clinical manifestations in assessing disease severity and the need for an objective test to assess Human African Trypanosomiasis clinical severity. The researchers suggest that their algorithm for initial clinical status assessment could serve as a basis for developing standardized assessment tools for the clinical management of HAT and information exchange in epidemiological reports.
Researchers used a computer vision pipeline to study the effects of isolation on social behavior in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster). They developed a new imaging arena and tracking algorithm to follow a large number of flies simultaneously, allowing for the analysis of social network dynamics. The team found that isolation led to significant changes in individual and local social network parameters, such as near-neighbor relationships, within a short period of time. To understand the molecular basis of these behavioral changes, they performed a genome-wide gene expression analysis and found that changes in gene expression occurred mainly on the first day of isolation. These changes were primarily in genes related to metabolism, and the team verified this by showing an increase in lipid content in isolated flies. The researchers also found that behavioral changes persisted for several days, while gene expression changes were transient. Overall, the study provides a reliable method for tracking and analyzing social behavior in large groups of flies and sheds light on the effects of isolation on social network dynamics, behavior, and physiology in Drosophila.
Researchers conducted a clinical pilot study in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the effectiveness of a smartphone-based decision-support tool for managing diarrheal disease in resource-limited settings. The tool was adapted from the World Health Organization's (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines and included a modality for age-based weight estimation. The study took place in two hospitals during the 2015 cholera season, where clinicians used the tool to guide treatment decisions. A total of 841 patients with uncomplicated diarrheal disease were enrolled in the study, which consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period, followed by a 10-day post-discharge follow-up.

The results showed that the use of the smartphone tool led to significant improvements in adherence to guidelines for prescribing intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. Specifically, the proportion of prescriptions for intravenous fluids decreased at both hospitals, while the proportion of prescriptions for the recommended antibiotic azithromycin increased. Additionally, the volume of intravenous fluids prescribed better adhered to recommendations when the tool was used.

The study's findings suggest that a smartphone-based tool can improve guideline adherence in resource-limited settings. However, the study had limitations, including the absence of a concurrent control group and no independent dehydration assessment during the pre-intervention period. Despite these limitations, the study identified opportunities to improve clinical care, including better assessment, weight estimation, and fluid/antibiotic selection. The study's results demonstrate the potential of technology-enabled decision-support tools to promote evidence-based practice in resource-limited settings.
Scientists have long struggled to predict how changes in temperature will affect the dynamics of host-parasite systems. This is because the interactions between hosts and parasites are complex and involve many different traits, such as survival and virulence, that have distinct temperature dependencies. To address this challenge, researchers used a mathematical model to analyze data from experiments on Daphnia magna, a small crustacean, and its natural parasite, Ordospora colligata. The model was based on the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), which describes how living organisms respond to temperature changes.

The researchers found that the MTE-based model was able to accurately predict the effects of temperature on host survival, parasite growth, and the cost of infection. The model used fewer parameters than traditional models, making it more efficient and easier to use. This study demonstrates the potential of linking simple metabolic models with a mechanistic host-parasite framework to predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. The results provide a valuable approach for predicting the outcomes and consequences of infections for hosts and parasites in the face of climate change. By using this framework, scientists can estimate the net effect of temperature changes on disease prevalence and severity, which is essential for understanding the impacts of climate change on host-parasite systems.
Researchers have identified a network of interneurons in the brain that plays a crucial role in controlling the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs). This network consists of three types of interneurons: parvalbumin-expressing (PV), somatostatin-expressing (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons. PV interneurons primarily inhibit the perisomatic regions and basal dendrites of PCs, while SOM interneurons mainly target the apical dendrites of PCs and strongly inhibit other interneuron types. VIP interneurons, on the other hand, mainly connect to the dendrite-targeting SOM neurons, creating a disinhibitory circuit for the distal dendrite of PCs.

The researchers propose that the interplay between these three interneuron types amplifies the redistribution of somato-dendritic inhibition onto PCs. They suggest that mutual inhibition between SOM and VIP neurons allows weak inputs to VIP interneurons to be translated into large changes in the somato-dendritic distribution of inhibition onto PCs. Using a computational model, the researchers demonstrate that the neuronal and synaptic properties of the circuit support this hypothesis. They also show that the SOM-VIP motif allows transient inputs to persistently switch the circuit between two processing modes, in which top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs are either integrated or cancelled.
Researchers have found that interactions between different species in the microbiome can lead to false associations between specific microbes and host phenotypes, such as disease. Microbiome-wide association studies (MWAS) compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples to identify links between microbes and phenotypes. However, these studies also reflect indirect effects due to microbial interactions, which can generate a large number of spurious associations that do not provide mechanistic insight.

A new method, called Direct Association Analysis (DAA), was developed using techniques from statistical physics to remove indirect associations. This method was applied to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests. The results showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease.

The study found that realistic microbial interactions can produce detectable changes in the abundance of many microbes that are not directly linked to host phenotype. This means that many previously reported associations between microbiota and IBD could be indirect. The researchers estimated the relative contribution of indirect associations to MWAS and showed how to isolate direct from indirect associations.

The study suggests that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease, and these direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls. The direct associations pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in IBD.
Researchers compared the effectiveness of two types of Wolbachia infection models in blocking the transmission of dengue and West Nile viruses in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolbachia is a bacterium that can be introduced into mosquitoes to prevent the spread of certain diseases. The study looked at two types of Wolbachia infection models: one where the bacteria are stably integrated into the mosquito's genome, and another where the bacteria are only temporarily present in the mosquito. The researchers found that Wolbachia was effective in blocking the transmission of both dengue and West Nile viruses in both types of infection models. However, the magnitude of the blocking effect was significantly lower in mosquitoes that were only temporarily infected with Wolbachia. The study also found no evidence that Wolbachia enhanced the infection of either dengue or West Nile virus in the mosquitoes. This suggests that Wolbachia could be a safe and effective way to prevent the spread of these viruses. The study's findings provide new insights into the interaction between Wolbachia, mosquitoes, and disease-causing pathogens, and could have important implications for the development of new strategies to control the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
Researchers studied the structure and function of cilia in the roundworm C. elegans. Cilia are microtubule-based organelles that help cells sense their environment. In C. elegans, cilia are divided into two regions: a proximal doublet-based region and a distal singlet-based region. The researchers found that the proximal region, called the "Inversin compartment" (InvC), is distinct from the doublet region. They identified two genetic modules, nphp-2 and arl-13, that interact to regulate ciliogenesis, or the formation of cilia. The nphp-2 module is required for the formation of the InvC, while the arl-13 module is required for the formation of the doublet region. The researchers also found that the InvC and doublet region are regulated by a network of genes, including nphp-2, arl-13, klp-11, and unc-119. This network modulates the size of the InvC and doublet region. Additionally, the researchers found that glutamylation, a post-translational modification of tubulin, is not required for the targeting of InvC and doublet region components to the cilium. However, glutamylation is modulated by the nphp-2, arl-13, and unc-119 genes. The researchers conclude that the InvC and doublet region are distinct regions of the cilium that interact to regulate ciliogenesis.
A protein called Scribble plays a crucial role in the development and regeneration of myelin in the central nervous system (CNS). Myelin is a fatty substance that surrounds nerve fibers, allowing them to transmit signals quickly and efficiently. Oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for producing myelin in the CNS, undergo significant changes in shape to initiate and form myelin sheaths. Researchers found that Scribble is present throughout oligodendroglial development and is up-regulated in mature oligodendrocytes, where it is localized to both developing and mature CNS myelin sheaths.

Knocking down Scribble expression in cultured oligodendrocytes resulted in disrupted morphology and myelination initiation. When Scribble expression was conditionally eliminated in the myelinating glia of transgenic mice, myelin initiation in the CNS was disrupted, both during development and following focal demyelination. Scribble also played a role in regulating myelin thickness and suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP) pathway. Additionally, Scribble localized to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it was required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion.

These findings demonstrate that Scribble is essential for myelination and remyelination in the CNS. Scribble's role in regulating myelin initiation, morphology, and thickness suggests that it plays a critical role in the development and regeneration of myelin in the CNS.
Researchers have discovered a new virulence factor, Listeriolysin S, in a subset of Listeria monocytogenes bacteria. This bacterium is responsible for listeriosis, a serious foodborne illness that can be fatal. The study found that Listeriolysin S is a haemolytic and cytotoxic peptide that contributes to the virulence of the pathogen. It is produced by a subset of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes strains, which are responsible for the majority of listeriosis outbreaks.

Listeriolysin S is similar to Streptolysin S, a virulence factor found in Group A Streptococcus, the bacteria that causes strep throat and other infections. However, Listeriolysin S is unique to Listeria monocytogenes and is not found in all strains of the bacteria. The discovery of Listeriolysin S provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Listeria monocytogenes and may help explain why some strains of the bacteria are more virulent than others.

The study also found that other Gram-positive pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum, produce similar virulence factors. These findings suggest that Listeriolysin S is part of a larger family of modified virulence peptides (MVPs) that are produced by various Gram-positive bacteria. The discovery of Listeriolysin S and other MVPs may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms of bacterial virulence and the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in the formation of mycetoma granulomas, a type of granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. Mycetoma granulomas are characterized by the presence of macroscopic structures called grains, surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The study aimed to determine if IL-17 and MMP-9 expression levels were correlated with the severity of the disease and independent of the causative agent.

The researchers analyzed surgical biopsies from 100 patients with confirmed mycetoma and found that IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was detected mainly in Zones II and III. MMP-9 expression was higher in biopsies from Actinomadura pelletierii and Streptomyces somaliensis compared to Madurella mycetomatis biopsies. The study also found a direct correlation between IL-17 and MMP-9 expression levels (p = 0.001) and a significant association between MMP-9 levels and disease duration (p < 0.001).

The results suggest that IL-17 and MMP-9 are present in mycetoma granulomas and that their expression levels may be related to the severity of the disease. However, further studies are needed to determine the roles of IL-17 and MMP-9 in granuloma formation and to provide insights into the immunopathogenesis of mycetoma. The study's findings indicate that IL-17 and MMP-9 may play a role in the formation of mycetoma granulomas, but more research is required to fully understand their functions.
Researchers studied the Ewing's Sarcoma oncoprotein family, specifically the transcriptional activation domain (EAD), which is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that remains disordered even when bound to a target. This phenomenon is known as "fuzziness" and is characterized by polyvalency, sequence-insensitivity, and a dynamic ensemble of disordered bound-state conformations. The researchers hypothesized that EAD-target binding involves polycation-π contacts between the disordered EAD and basic residues on the target. To test this hypothesis, they evaluated the effects of EAD sequence variations, including aromatic number, aromatic density, and charge perturbations, and found that these changes supported the cation-π model. A coarse-grained EAD chain model and an analytical model based on interaction between EAD aromatics and surface cations of a generic globular target also captured the activity trends observed. The results suggest that EAD-target binding is driven by a balance between EAD conformational entropy and favorable EAD-target cation-π contacts. This mode of molecular recognition is highly versatile and offers a general conceptual framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs. The study provides new insights into the physical basis of polyaromatic EAD function and has implications for understanding the roles of IDPs in protein-protein interactions, particularly in the context of cancer.
Researchers studied the functions of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This bacterium has a unique characteristic of having two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, unlike most other bacteria. Previous studies showed that Lon-1 is upregulated when the bacterium is exposed to blood, while Lon-2 is not. The researchers wanted to understand the roles of these two proteases in the bacterium's life cycle.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in their substrate binding domains, suggesting they may have different substrate specificities. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease in vitro, but did not complement an Escherichia coli Lon mutant. In contrast, Lon-2 corrected two characteristic Lon-mutant phenotypes. These results suggest that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functional roles in Borrelia burgdorferi.

Lon-2 appears to function similarly to the canonical Lon protease, involved in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, on the other hand, may play a role in host adaptation, particularly during the transition from an arthropod host to a warm-blooded host. This is supported by its upregulation in response to blood and its unique presence in the Borrelia genus. The researchers conclude that Lon-1 and Lon-2 have different functions in Borrelia burgdorferi, with Lon-1 potentially involved in host adaptation and Lon-2 in cellular homeostasis.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) infection. ADP is a process by which antibodies help phagocytic cells engulf and destroy pathogens. The study found that HIV-1 virions were not efficiently phagocytosed by phagocytic cells in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. However, when HIV-1 virions were coated with a specific protein called gp41, antibodies were able to mediate phagocytosis. The study suggests that the paucity of envelope spikes on the surface of HIV-1 virions makes it difficult for antibodies to cross-link Fc gamma receptors on phagocytic cells, which is necessary for ADP to occur. In contrast, cells infected with HIV-1 were found to be targets for phagocytosis or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. The findings indicate that ADP of free virions may not play a significant role in preventing HIV-1 infection, but ADP or trogocytosis could play a role in clearing HIV-infected cells. The study suggests that Fc gamma receptor-dependent functions other than ADP of free virions may be critical for maximal prevention or control of HIV-1 infection by antibody.
A new study estimates the global economic and health burden of human hookworm infection, a neglected tropical disease. The researchers used a computational simulation model to calculate the impact of hookworm infection in every country, World Health Organization (WHO) region, and globally in 2016. The study found that hookworm infection resulted in 2.13 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) using 2004 disability weight estimates and 4.09 million DALYs using 2010 disability weight estimates, excluding cognitive impairment outcomes. Including cognitive impairment did not significantly increase DALYs worldwide.

The study also estimated the total productivity losses due to hookworm infection, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages, and from $2.4 billion to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as a proxy. The researchers found that the economic and health burden of hookworm infection exceeded published estimates for several diseases that have received more attention, such as rotavirus.

The study also highlighted that large countries transitioning to higher-income countries, such as Brazil and China, still face significant hookworm burdens. The researchers estimated that 89.8 million hookworm infections resulted in productivity losses totaling $11.1 billion using one method, $87.9 billion using another method, and $23.1 billion using a third method, assuming a median likelihood of anemia and using gross national income per capita as a proxy for annual wages.
Researchers studied how a lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, affects the development of the brain in vertebrates, such as zebrafish. They found that hypoxia disrupts the pathfinding of forebrain neurons, leading to errors in which axons fail to cross the midline. This is similar to what has been observed in invertebrates, such as the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The researchers discovered that the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif1) pathway is activated in response to hypoxia, leading to increased expression of ephrinB2a, a protein involved in axon guidance. They found that blocking the activity of hif1α, a key component of the hif1 pathway, prevented the guidance defects. Additionally, knocking down ephrinB2a rescued the guidance errors, suggesting that it plays a critical role in the pathfinding defects caused by hypoxia. The researchers also found that magnesium sulfate, a compound used to improve neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm births, protects against pathfinding errors by preventing the upregulation of ephrinB2a. These findings demonstrate that evolutionarily conserved genetic pathways regulate connectivity changes in the central nervous system in response to hypoxia, and suggest a potential neuroprotective role for magnesium. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of hypoxic injury to the developing brain and highlights the importance of ephrinB2a in mediating the effects of hypoxia on axon pathfinding.
Researchers studied how a fungal infection called paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) affects the lungs of mice. PCM is a disease caused by a fungus called Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which is common in certain parts of the world. The study used high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathology to examine the progression of lung lesions in infected mice over time.

The researchers found three main patterns of lung damage: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tumoral. They observed that the lesions were mainly located around the lung's hilus and affected the left lung more frequently. Using HRCT, they found that 80% of infected mice developed peri-bronchial consolidations and increased upper lung density by the fourth week of infection.

Histopathology revealed that these consolidations were equivalent to a confluent granulomatous reaction, while nodules corresponded to individual compact granulomas. By the 16th week, confluent granulomas formed pseudo-tumoral masses that obstructed large bronchi. The study also found discrete focal fibrosis around granulomas, which was only visible through histopathology.

The researchers concluded that conventional HRCT is a useful tool for evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in experimental PCM. This non-invasive technique can help monitor treatment efficacy and reduce the need to sacrifice a large number of animals. The study provides new insights into the progression of PCM in mice and has implications for understanding the disease in humans.
Researchers have proposed the use of an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γRA) as a potential marker for latent Leishmania donovani infection. The study modified a commercial kit, QuantiFERON, to evaluate five different leishmania-specific antigens: H2B, H2B-PSA2, H2B-Lepp12, crude soluble antigen (CSA), and soluble leishmania antigen (SLA). The assay was tested on blood samples from 13 active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients, 15 cured VL patients, 11 non-endemic healthy controls, and 19 healthy endemic controls. The results showed that the SLA-based QuantiFERON assay had a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100% in detecting the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. A surprising finding was the production of IFN-γ in active VL patients upon stimulation with leishmania antigen, which contradicts previous studies showing a non-proliferative antigen-specific response in these patients. The study suggests that the whole-blood SLA-based QuantiFERON assay can be used to measure the cell-mediated immune response in L. donovani infection. Further research is needed to understand the positive IFN-γ response in active VL patients.
Researchers have discovered that a toxin called CNFY plays a crucial role in the development of persistent infections caused by Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. This bacterium can cause gastrointestinal infections that lead to relapsing enteritis and severe autoimmune disorders. To establish a persistent infection, the bacteria must navigate through the intestinal epithelium and colonize the underlying gut-associated lymphatic tissues. However, the mechanisms by which the bacteria evade the host's immune response are not well understood.

The study found that the CNFY toxin induces inflammatory responses, leading to tissue destruction, changes in the intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance. However, suppressing the CNFY toxin's function leads to increased interferon-γ-mediated responses, which include non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This process allows the bacteria to reprogram their transcriptional response, giving them a fitness advantage against the host's immune response and enabling them to establish a commensal lifestyle.

The researchers demonstrated that removing the CNFY toxin is sufficient to dampen inflammation and allow the bacteria to evade the host's immune defense, leading to the establishment of a persistent infection. The study suggests that the CNFY toxin represents a double-edged sword, as it enhances inflammation and tissue damage, but also facilitates the bacteria's ability to establish a persistent infection. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms by which Yersinia pseudotuberculosis evades the host's immune response and establishes a persistent infection.
Researchers have identified a new gene, DES1, in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that plays a crucial role in the fungus's ability to infect and colonize rice plants. The DES1 gene helps the fungus evade the plant's natural defense mechanisms by suppressing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are a key part of the plant's immune response. When the DES1 gene is deleted, the fungus is no longer able to suppress ROS production, leading to a strong defense response in the plant and a significant reduction in the fungus's ability to infect and colonize the plant.

The researchers used a combination of genetic and biochemical techniques to study the role of DES1 in the fungus's pathogenicity. They found that the DES1 gene encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, and that its deletion had no apparent effect on the fungus's growth or development, except for a slight reduction in conidial size. However, the mutant fungus was hypersensitive to oxidative stress and had reduced activity of extracellular enzymes, including peroxidases and laccases.

When the mutant fungus was used to infect a susceptible rice cultivar, it triggered a strong defense response in the plant, characterized by the accumulation of ROS, the generation of autofluorescent materials, and the induction of PR genes in neighboring tissues. The researchers also found that treatment with diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidases, reduced the plant's defense response and allowed the mutant fungus to recover its ability to infect and colonize the plant. These findings suggest that DES1 plays a key role in the fungus's ability to evade the plant's immune response and that it may be a potential target for the development of new disease control strategies.
Researchers in Ghana evaluated the accuracy of model-based geostatistics (MBG) in predicting the prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection, a type of schistosomiasis, in schools across the country. MBG is a method used to predict disease prevalence in areas where it is impractical to conduct surveys. The study compared MBG predictions with empiric prevalence values obtained from school surveys conducted in 79 sites. The results showed that using MBG predictions alone would have led to undertreatment of 28% of children in high-risk schools and unnecessary treatment of 12% of children in schools with no infection. The study suggests that MBG should not be used as a one-time exercise, but rather as an iterative process that incorporates empiric testing and model refining to create updated versions that meet the needs of disease control operational managers. The researchers found that aggregating prevalence estimates to the district level using the current predictive map for Ghana was not adequate for guiding the national schistosomiasis control program. The study highlights the importance of improving the understanding of how to use predictive risk maps to guide treatment delivery decisions, assessment techniques, and modeling approaches to schistosomiasis.
Researchers have discovered that a mixture of prostaglandins, specifically F-series prostaglandins, plays a crucial role in guiding sperm through the reproductive tract of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of nematode worm. These prostaglandins are synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) found in yolk lipoprotein complexes. The study used genetics and mass spectrometry to identify the pathways involved in F-series prostaglandin metabolism and found that multiple PUFAs, including arachidonic and eicosapentaenoic acids, are converted into over 10 structurally related F-series prostaglandins. These prostaglandins work together and redundantly to promote sperm guidance. The researchers also found that disrupting the synthesis of omega-3 PUFAs triggers a compensatory increase in prostaglandins derived from omega-6 PUFAs. Furthermore, the study identified a conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme that negatively regulates prostaglandin synthesis. The results suggest that multiple cyclooxygenase-independent prostaglandins work together to promote sperm motility, which is essential for fertilization. This pathway may be conserved across species, as similar prostaglandins are found in mouse tissues. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of sperm guidance and fertilization, and highlights the importance of F-series prostaglandins in this process.
Researchers have developed a new approach to reduce the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics, which are proteins used to treat diseases. Immunogenicity, or the ability of a protein to trigger an immune response, can hinder the development and use of biotherapeutics. To address this issue, scientists have created algorithms that optimize proteins for both reduced T cell epitope content and high-level function. These algorithms have revealed that there is no single optimal design for deimmunization, but rather a spectrum of designs that balance immunogenic potential and molecular function. The leading edge of this design space is the Pareto frontier, which represents the best-performing designs that cannot be improved in both criteria.

Eighteen Pareto optimal variants of a therapeutic enzyme were produced and experimentally analyzed. The results showed that the predicted tradeoffs between protein function and immunogenicity were borne out in real-world analyses. The study found an inverse relationship between deimmunization and function, meaning that greater deimmunization comes at the expense of reduced function. To assess the practical implications of these tradeoffs, the researchers recombinantly produced all 18 designed enzymes and characterized their stability, activity, and immunoreactivity with human MHC II proteins. The results provide a systematic and rigorous assessment of the functional penalty associated with pursuing progressively more deimmunized biotherapeutic candidates. This approach may prove useful in augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking experimental deimmunization efforts.
Researchers studied how temperature affects the process of meiosis in plants, specifically Arabidopsis thaliana. Meiosis is a critical process in sexual reproduction that involves the exchange of DNA between chromosomes to ensure proper chromosome segregation. The frequency and distribution of these exchanges, called crossovers (COs), are regulated by internal and external factors. The study found that elevated temperatures increase the frequency of COs in Arabidopsis, a phenomenon known as meiotic hyper-recombination.

The researchers used genetic analysis to determine that the increased COs are derived from the Type I interference-sensitive pathway, rather than the Type II pathway, which is insensitive to interference. They also found that the increased COs are not the result of an increase in DNA double-strand breaks, but rather a specific response to thermal stress. The study suggests that temperature-dependent modulation of meiotic CO frequency is not a universal response to stress, but rather a unique response to heat.

The researchers used a pollen-based visual assay to demonstrate that thermal stress-induced COs are generated by the Type I pathway and act additively with Type II pathway perturbations, resulting in an enhanced hyper-recombination phenotype. The study provides initial mechanistic insight into how environmental cues modulate plant meiotic recombination and may have practical applications for plant breeding. The findings suggest that temperature-dependent modulation of meiotic CO frequency could be used to aid plant breeding without editing the genome or working in mutant backgrounds.
Researchers have developed a novel computational approach to help scientists navigate the vast and rapidly evolving biomedical literature. The approach, called the Hanalyzer, combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. It extracts information from external resources, tracks knowledge provenance, and enriches the knowledge by noting relationships between genes and calculating a combined reliability score. The Hanalyzer also combines the knowledge network with a congruent network constructed from experimental data and visualizes the combined network to facilitate knowledge-based analysis. An implementation of the Hanalyzer was demonstrated on a large-scale gene expression array dataset relevant to craniofacial development, leading to the creation of hypotheses regarding the roles of four genes never previously characterized as involved in craniofacial development. These hypotheses were validated by further experimental work. The Hanalyzer also includes a Cytoscape plugin called CommonAttributes, which allows users to trace the provenance of links in the knowledge network and access underlying data sources and publications. The approach can be used to identify functional explanations of a gene list by exploiting inferences not available in individual data sources. By combining the knowledge network with a data network constructed from experimental data, the Hanalyzer can highlight linkages in the data that are well supported by existing knowledge or generate novel hypotheses.
Researchers have identified the molecules on the surface of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the parasitic worm Fasciola hepatica. These EVs can be internalized by host immune cells, allowing the parasite to modulate the host's immune response. The study focused on two sub-populations of EVs, termed 15k and 120k EVs, which differ in size and cargo. Using a biotin reagent to capture proteins on the surface of these EVs, the researchers identified 380 surface proteins, including virulence factors, membrane transport proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis and trafficking.

Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the 120k EVs originate from the parasite's excretory system, while the 15k EVs are released from the gut epithelial cells. A lectin microarray strategy was used to profile the surface oligosaccharides of intact EVs, showing that the 15k and 120k EVs have similar glycoconjugate profiles, distinct from the parasite's surface tegument. The researchers found that the EVs' surface oligosaccharides are resistant to certain enzymes, but can be remodeled by glyco-amidase PNGase F, which blocks the uptake of EVs by host macrophages. Pre-treatment with antibodies against specific EV surface proteins enhanced the internalization of EVs by host cells. This study highlights the diversity of EV biogenesis and trafficking pathways used by F. hepatica and sheds light on the molecular interaction between parasite EVs and host cells.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called CDF2 in the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants. miRNAs are small RNA molecules that play a crucial role in controlling gene expression and are essential for plant development. CDF2 is a transcription factor that interacts with an enzyme called DCL1, which is responsible for processing miRNAs. The study found that CDF2 regulates the transcription and processing of a group of miRNAs, known as primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs), to maintain proper levels of mature miRNAs. This regulation is important for controlling plant development, including flowering.

CDF2 was found to bind directly to the promoters of some miRNA genes, acting as a transcription activator or repressor, and also affects the processing of pri-miRNAs by DCL1. The study suggests that CDF2 works in the same pathway as two well-studied miRNAs, miR156 and miR172, to control flowering. The researchers also found that CDF2 regulates the expression of components involved in miRNA biogenesis, which may affect the levels of mature miRNAs. This suggests that CDF2 plays a complex role in regulating miRNA biogenesis at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The study's findings provide new insights into the regulation of miRNAs in plants and highlight the importance of CDF2 in controlling plant development.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for a metabolic intermediate called geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) in the development of eggs in the ovaries. GGPP is involved in a process called protein geranylgeranylation, which is essential for the communication between the egg and the surrounding granulosa cells. This communication is vital for the growth and development of the follicle, a structure that contains the egg, and is necessary for female fertility.

During early follicular development, the levels of GGPP and the enzyme that produces it, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (Ggpps), increase in the egg. When GGPP is depleted from the egg, the communication between the egg and the granulosa cells is disrupted, leading to impaired growth and development of the follicle. Specifically, the depletion of GGPP inhibits the geranylgeranylation of certain proteins, including Rho GTPase and Rab27a, which are involved in cell adhesion and secretion, respectively.

As a result, the granulosa cells are unable to proliferate and the primary-secondary follicle transition, a critical phase of follicular development, is blocked. However, administering GGPP to mice with depleted Ggpps restored the normal communication between the egg and the granulosa cells, granulosa cell proliferation, and the primary-secondary follicle transition. These findings highlight the importance of GGPP-mediated protein geranylgeranylation in the establishment of oocyte-granulosa cell communication and the regulation of follicular development.
Researchers have created a detailed structural model of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme, which is responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA from a DNA template. This model includes the complete transcription bubble, a region of the DNA that is crucial for understanding how nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) substrates reach the enzyme's active site. The study aimed to determine whether the "secondary channel" or the "main channel" is the primary route for NTP entry.

Using molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis, the researchers found that the secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription. They discovered that the main channel has enough space to allow NTP loading, but the diffusion of NTP through this channel is hindered by electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged DNA backbone. In contrast, the secondary channel has a higher percentage of conformations with enough space for NTP loading.

The researchers built a structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble by extending the DNA and nascent mRNA strands to 47 and 18 nucleotides in length, respectively. This model allowed them to examine the possibility of NTP loading through the main channel, which is not possible with existing crystal structures of the Pol II elongation complex. The study's findings provide new insights into the Pol II transcription process and highlight the importance of the secondary channel in NTP entry.
Dengue is a significant public health problem in Thailand and Cambodia, particularly among children under 15 years old. Despite being a reportable disease, the true burden of dengue is likely underestimated due to underreporting. Researchers used data from prospective cohort studies to estimate the magnitude of underrecognition and provide more accurate disease burden estimates for these countries. The studies found that the average annual incidence of laboratory-confirmed dengue was 23/1,000 in Thailand and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Age-group specific multiplication factors (MFs) were calculated by comparing cohort study data to national surveillance data and ranged from 0.4 to 29. These MFs were then applied to country-level reporting data to estimate the true number of dengue cases. The results showed that in Thailand, a median of 229,886 dengue cases occurred annually from 2003-2007, while in Cambodia, a median of 111,178 cases occurred in children under 15 years old. The underrecognition of total and inpatient dengue cases was estimated to be 8.7 and 2.6-fold in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4-fold in Cambodia, respectively. The study highlights the need for more accurate disease burden estimates to inform public health interventions. Calculating MFs by comparing prospective cohort study data to locally-reported national surveillance data is a useful approach to assess disease burden. The findings suggest that national surveillance data significantly underrecognize the true burden of dengue in these countries.
Researchers have found that natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in promoting early immune responses against the cytomegalovirus (CMV), a common virus that can cause serious illness in people with weakened immune systems. In a study using mice, scientists discovered that NK cells accelerate the development of CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight off viral infections. This is achieved by limiting the production of interferon-alpha/beta (IFN-α/β), a cytokine that can be immunosuppressive if produced in high levels. By controlling CMV replication early on, NK cells prevent the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which produce high levels of IFN-α/β, and preserve conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), which help activate CD8 T cells. As a result, NK cells promote optimal conditions for the initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. The study also found that administering exogenous IFN-α in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation, highlighting the importance of NK cells in regulating the intensity of innate immune responses. Overall, the research demonstrates that NK cells not only directly contribute to antiviral defense but also play a regulatory role in the immune response, preventing immunopathology and promoting adaptive immunity.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called nucleolin in controlling the expression of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant. They found that nucleolin plays a crucial role in regulating which rRNA genes are turned on or off. The team identified four different variants of rRNA genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and discovered that nucleolin helps control the expression of these variants. In plants with a disrupted nucleolin gene, some rRNA genes that are normally turned off are turned on, while others that are normally turned on are turned off. The researchers also found that nucleolin helps control the methylation of DNA at rRNA genes, which is a process that helps determine which genes are active or inactive. Without nucleolin, the DNA methylation at rRNA genes is disrupted, leading to the accumulation of pre-rRNA, which is an intermediate step in the production of rRNA. The study suggests that nucleolin acts as a key regulator of rRNA gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, helping to ensure that the right amount of rRNA is produced for the plant's growth and development. The findings provide new insights into the complex process of rRNA gene regulation and the role of nucleolin in this process.
Researchers have identified a protein from the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) that interacts with a complex called NuRD, which plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The HCMV protein, called pUL29/28, binds to the NuRD complex, which helps to modify the structure of chromatin, the material that makes up chromosomes. This modification, called histone deacetylation, is essential for the virus to replicate efficiently. The researchers used a technique called mass spectrometry to identify the interaction between pUL29/28 and the NuRD complex. They found that pUL29/28 and another HCMV protein, pUL38, associate with a component of the NuRD complex called MTA2. When the researchers knocked down other components of the NuRD complex, called RBBP4 and CHD4, they found that it inhibited the accumulation of HCMV immediate-early RNA and DNA. This suggests that multiple components of the NuRD complex are necessary for efficient HCMV replication. The researchers also found that pUL29/28 can enhance the activity of the HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter assay, and that this effect requires the presence of functional NuRD components. This suggests that pUL29/28 modifies the NuRD complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediate-early RNAs, which are essential for HCMV replication. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which HCMV regulates gene expression and replicates within host cells.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in young children. RSV is a major cause of pneumonia in infants. The study used a technique called whole-genome-phage-display libraries (GFPDL) to identify the specific parts of the virus that the immune system targets, known as epitopes. The researchers analyzed blood samples from infants before and after their first RSV infection, as well as from older children and adults. They found that the immune response to the virus's fusion protein (F) changed little after infection, but the response to the attachment protein (G) increased significantly. The study identified several new epitopes on the G protein that the immune system targets. The researchers also found that the immune response to the pre-fusion form of the F protein was stronger than to the post-fusion form. In contrast, the immune response to the G protein was high in young children but decreased in adults. The study suggests that the immune system's response to RSV evolves over time and that the G protein is a key target for the immune system. These findings could help in the development of effective countermeasures against RSV, such as vaccines.
Emodepside, a veterinary anthelmintic, has been found to have potent macrofilaricidal effects on adult Brugia malayi, a parasitic nematode that causes lymphatic filariasis. Researchers discovered that emodepside inhibits the motility of adult worms by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, specifically targeting the SLO-1 K channel. The study found that males are more sensitive to emodepside than females, with the slo-1f isoform, found in male muscles, being more sensitive to the drug than the slo-1a isoform found in female muscles.

Further investigation revealed that alternative splicing in the RCK1 region of the SLO-1 channel affects the potency of emodepside. In silico modeling identified a binding pocket in the RCK1 region that is affected by these splice variations. The study also found that selective RNAi of the slo-1a isoform in female worms increased the potency of emodepside.

These findings suggest that emodepside has sex-dependent immobilizing effects on adult Brugia malayi due to a differentially spliced binding pocket in the RCK1 region of the SLO-1 K channel. This discovery is important for the development of emodepside as a macrofilaricide, as it highlights the need to evaluate potential sex-dependent effects of anthelmintic compounds to prevent under-dosing of one or the other gender of nematodes. Emodepside has completed first-in-human safety and tolerability studies and is being developed for the treatment of onchocerciasis, a disease caused by another type of filarial nematode.
Researchers have identified the antigens responsible for cross-reactivity between Loa loa and Wuchereria bancrofti rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for lymphatic filariasis (LF). The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis relies on RDTs to determine where mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. However, cross-reactivity with Loa loa has hindered LF elimination efforts in loiasis-endemic areas. To address this issue, the researchers used the DH6.5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa loa antigens from the sera of individuals with a positive RDT due to loiasis. Immunoblot analysis revealed many circulating AD12/DH6.5-reactive antigens, and proteomic analysis identified multiple Loa loa proteins in LF RDT-positive loiasis sera. These proteins included both secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting they may be released by dying Loa loa adult worms and/or microfilariae. Unlike the single high molecular weight W. bancrofti circulating filarial antigen present in the blood of persons with bancroftian filariasis, reactive Loa loa antigens appeared to be only transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with loiasis. These key differences between the circulating antigens of W. bancrofti and Loa loa can be used to differentiate positive results generated by both species and may lead to improved diagnostic tests for LF and loiasis.
Researchers have identified a new protein, RAB-28, that plays a crucial role in the development and function of primary cilia, specialized sensory and signaling structures found on many eukaryotic cells. Primary cilia are essential for various physiological and developmental processes, and defects in them can lead to inherited disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Using the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism, the researchers used a technique called RNA-Seq to analyze the expression of genes involved in cilia formation and function. They found that RAB-28 is a small GTPase that is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons and associates with the Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) complex, a protein complex that helps regulate the movement of molecules within the cilium. The researchers also found that RAB-28 is involved in the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is essential for the formation and maintenance of cilia. When RAB-28 is overexpressed in its active or inactive forms, it leads to defects in cilia structure and function. The study provides new insights into the biology of cilia and identifies RAB-28 as a novel protein involved in cilia development and function. The findings have implications for understanding the causes of ciliopathies and may lead to the development of new treatments for these disorders.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents the outside world using neural responses. They focused on hippocampal place cells, which are cells in the brain that respond to specific locations in an environment. The researchers found that by analyzing which groups of these cells fire together, they can extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate representation of physical space. This representation can be used to track an animal's position within that space.

The study showed that knowing which groups of place cells fire together is enough to infer global topological features of a two-dimensional environment and an accurate geometric reconstruction of physical space. This is a significant finding because previous approaches to reconstructing position from place cell activity required knowing the corresponding place fields, which are functions that assign a firing rate to each position in space.

The researchers did not need to know the actual place fields or any other prior measurements of position to achieve this result. They only assumed that place fields exist and have a stereotypical form. This suggests that the brain may be able to construct its own internal representations of the environment using only the activity of place cells. The study's findings may have implications for our understanding of how the brain represents the outside world and how it uses neural responses to navigate and understand its environment.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β in viral fulminant hepatitis (FH), a severe liver disease caused by excessive inflammation. They used a mouse model infected with the murine hepatitis virus strain-3 (MHV-3) to study the disease. The study found that mice deficient in the IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) or treated with an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) showed reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. These mice also had lower levels of IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, in their serum and liver.

The researchers discovered that the NLRP3 inflammasome, a complex that activates IL-1β, played a key role in the disease. They found that mice deficient in NLRP3 or caspase-1, another component of the inflammasome, had reduced IL-1β production and less severe liver disease. The study also showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by infected macrophages activated the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to IL-1β production.

The results suggest that the ROS/NLRP3/IL-1β axis is a critical signaling pathway that contributes to the severity of viral FH. The study's findings have implications for the development of treatments for viral FH and other inflammatory diseases.
Researchers conducted a study in Malawi to investigate the role of hookworm infections in severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. They used a new diagnostic tool called multiplex real-time PCR to detect and differentiate between two types of hookworms, Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus. The study found that 34.1% of children with severe anemia had hookworm infections, compared to 27.0% of children without severe anemia. Ancylostoma duodenale was found to be a significant contributor to severe anemia, with moderate and high-load infections increasing the risk by 2.49 and 9.04 times, respectively. The study also found that iron deficiency was associated with the intensity of Ancylostoma duodenale infection, with high-load infections increasing the risk by 44.91 times. The researchers detected a much higher prevalence of Ancylostoma duodenale than expected, highlighting the need for quantitative and species-specific screening of hookworm infections. The study suggests that Ancylostoma duodenale is a key factor in the etiology of severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi. The use of multiplex real-time PCR as a diagnostic tool has the potential to combat severe anemia and iron deficiency in children living in resource-poor settings.
Researchers have identified a protein called COM-1 that plays a crucial role in the process of meiosis, a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells. Meiosis involves the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through two main pathways: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR is necessary for the formation of interhomolog crossovers (COs), which are essential for proper chromosome segregation. COM-1 promotes HR by counteracting the NHEJ complex Ku, which can lead to error-prone repair and chromosomal abnormalities. In the absence of COM-1, cells repair DSBs through NHEJ, resulting in a lack of COs, chromosomal aggregation, and near-complete embryonic lethality.

Studies in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans revealed that COM-1 is not required for the initiation of meiotic DSB repair, but rather for channeling the programmed DSBs into HR. COM-1 acts parallel to the nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhomolog HR at the early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, ensuring timely CO formation. The researchers also found that COM-1 is dispensable for RAD-51 recruitment at the late pachytene stage, suggesting further redundancy and/or temporal regulation of DNA end resection during meiotic prophase. The study highlights the potentially lethal properties of NHEJ during meiosis and identifies a critical role for COM-1 in NHEJ inhibition and CO assurance in germ cells.
Researchers used a goat model to study the body's immune response to Burkholderia pseudomallei, the bacteria that causes melioidosis. This disease is a common source of pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, resulting in high mortality rates. The study aimed to identify proteins that trigger an immune response, which could lead to the development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines.

The researchers infected goats with B. pseudomallei through an aerosol, mimicking how humans typically contract the disease. They analyzed the goats' blood for antibodies, which are proteins produced by the immune system to fight off infections. The results showed that the goats produced a strong immune response, with a greater number of antibodies (IgG) compared to a different type of antibody (IgM).

The researchers identified several proteins that triggered an immune response in the goats, including chaperone proteins that help other proteins fold correctly. One of these proteins, called GroEL, elicited the strongest immune response. The study also found that many of the proteins that triggered an immune response in the goats were similar to those found in humans with melioidosis.

The findings suggest that the goat model is a useful tool for studying the immune response to B. pseudomallei and could lead to the development of new diagnostic tests and vaccines. The study's results also highlight the similarities between the immune response in goats and humans, which could aid in the development of treatments for melioidosis.
Researchers have long understood that the activation of cyclin B1-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) is crucial for initiating mitosis, the process by which a cell divides into two daughter cells. However, the exact timing and progression of Cdk1 activation during mitosis has been unclear. A new study used a novel approach to track the activity of Cdk1 in single cells and found that it continues to be activated after centrosome separation, a key event in the early stages of mitosis. The researchers discovered that cytoplasmic Cdk1 activity can be maintained even when cyclin B1, the protein that activates Cdk1, translocates to the nucleus in prophase, a stage of mitosis.

The study found that Cdk1 activity gradually increases between centrosome separation and prometaphase, a stage of mitosis, and that distinct thresholds of Cdk1 activity are required for successive mitotic events. The researchers propose that the gradual increase in Cdk1 activity after centrosome separation is critical for coordinating mitotic progression. They also found that reducing Cdk1 levels can lead to a threshold concentration that triggers rapid further activation of Cdk1 and entry into mitosis. The study's findings suggest that the activation of Cdk1 is a complex process that involves multiple stages and thresholds, and that it plays a critical role in coordinating the events of mitosis.
Researchers studied the immune response of 21 Kenyan women who were infected with HIV-1 and later superinfected with a different strain of the virus. They found that the women's immune systems developed a broad and potent response to the new infection, but it was not dominated by antibodies targeting specific areas of the HIV-1 virus known to be important for neutralizing the virus. These areas, known as epitopes, include the CD4-binding site, a V1/V2 glycan, the N332 supersite in V3, and the membrane proximal external region of gp41. In fact, the researchers were unable to detect a dominant antibody response to these epitopes in any of the women's plasma samples. This suggests that superinfection may drive the development of a broad polyclonal antibody response, meaning that the immune system produces a diverse range of antibodies that target multiple different areas of the virus. This finding has implications for the development of an HIV-1 vaccine, as it suggests that a vaccine that targets multiple epitopes may be more effective in eliciting a broad and potent neutralizing antibody response. The study's results provide support for vaccine designs that use multivalent HIV immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of neutralizing antibodies.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide. Researchers have found that HCMV infection disrupts the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which are essential for fetal brain development. One key component of the Notch pathway is the Hes1 protein, which regulates the fate of NPCs and their differentiation into neurons or glia. In this study, scientists discovered that HCMV infection downregulates Hes1 protein levels in infected NPCs. They found that the HCMV 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is responsible for Hes1 degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes1 ubiquitination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase. This process leads to the proteasomal degradation of Hes1. The study also identified Sp100A, a component of PML nuclear bodies, as another target of IE1-mediated ubiquitination. The researchers found that a specific region of IE1, spanning amino acids 451 to 475, is required for IE1/Hes1 interaction and IE1-mediated Hes1 ubiquitination, but not for IE1/Sp100A interaction and ubiquitination. These findings suggest a novel mechanism linking Hes1 downregulation to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by HCMV infection and provide new insights into the role of IE1 as a potential HCMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.
A recent study investigated the relationship between transcription factor binding and gene expression in the embryos of four Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis. The researchers analyzed the binding of four transcription factors involved in early anterior-posterior patterning using ChIP-seq and compared it to gene expression levels measured by mRNA-seq. The study found that while gene expression levels are highly conserved across species, transcription factor binding has diverged significantly. In fact, the extent of conservation of transcription factor binding sites decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between species.

The researchers also found that highly bound sites, sites bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes are conserved more frequently than other binding sites. This suggests that a significant amount of transcription factor binding is weak or non-functional and not subject to purifying selection. The study also investigated the relationship between sequence divergence and binding divergence, but found that sequence changes only explain a small portion of the variance in TF binding divergence between species.

In contrast, gene expression levels are highly correlated between species, with the correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance. Overall, the study suggests that transcription factor binding has diverged extensively in the Drosophila genus, but has had little effect on downstream gene expression. The researchers identified two potential genetic sources of binding divergence, including alterations of specific motifs for the transcription factors BCD, HB, GT, and KR.
A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjavur district, India, to assess the effectiveness of eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis. The study aimed to evaluate the monitoring and evaluation guidelines for the program to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, which require impact assessments in at least one sentinel and one spot-check site in each implementation unit.

The study found that the prevalence and intensity of microfilariae (Mf) in the surveyed population were 0.2% and 0.004, respectively, while the corresponding values for antigenaemia (Ag) were 2.3% and 17.3 Ag-units. Although the Mf levels in the survey and sentinel/spot check sites were less than 1%, and the Ag level was less than 2% in children, the study identified 7 "residual" and 17 "transmission" hotspots, where Mf prevalence was greater than or equal to 1% or at least one Ag-positive child was born during the MDA period.

The study suggests that the current monitoring and evaluation guidelines may miss sites with transmission potential and that the statistical assumptions for sampling and threshold levels for decision-making have not been validated. The study proposes an Ag-prevalence of approximately 1% in children as a possible threshold value for stopping MDA. The findings indicate the need for developing good surveillance strategies for detecting hotspots and adopting evidence-based sampling strategies and evaluation unit size for transmission assessment surveys.
A systematic literature review assessed the effectiveness of temephos, an organophosphate larvicide, in controlling dengue vectors and disease transmission when used alone or in combination with other interventions. The review included 27 studies and found that temephos was effective in reducing entomological indices, such as the number of mosquito larvae, when used as a single intervention. However, when used in combination with other chemical vector control methods, temephos was not consistently effective in reducing entomological indices or dengue transmission. The effectiveness of temephos was found to depend on various factors, including the quality of delivery, water turnover rate, type of water, and environmental conditions such as organic debris, temperature, and sunlight exposure. The review also identified limitations in the use of temephos, including the need for reapplication, reluctance to apply it to drinking water, and operational challenges such as cost, supplies, time, and labor. Overall, the review suggests that temephos can be an effective tool for controlling dengue vectors when used alone, but its effectiveness is uncertain when used in combination with other interventions. The review highlights the need for further research on the impact of temephos on dengue transmission and the factors that influence its effectiveness.
Scientists have long known that the cohesin complex plays a crucial role in holding sister chromatids together from the time of their duplication in S phase until their separation during mitosis. While cohesin is found along the length of chromosomes, it is most abundant at the centromere and surrounding region, known as the pericentromere. Two proteins, Ctf19 and Csm3, have been identified as important mediators of pericentromeric cohesion, but their mechanisms of action were not well understood. Research has shown that the Ctf19 complex directs the increased association of cohesin with the pericentromere, while Csm3 is essential for ensuring the functionality of cohesin in holding sister centromeres together. The study found that components of the Ctf19 complex, specifically Iml3 and Chl4, are responsible for directing cohesin to the pericentromere during both mitosis and meiosis. In the absence of Iml3 and Chl4, cohesin binding at the pericentromere is reduced, leading to defects in sister chromatid cohesion and chromosome segregation. Csm3, on the other hand, is crucial for ensuring the integrity of the replisome and its association with cohesion establishment factors as it traverses the protein-DNA barrier surrounding the centromere. The study suggests that the Ctf19 complex and Csm3 work together to establish cohesion at the pericentromere, ensuring the fidelity of chromosome segregation.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a widespread arbovirus that causes dengue fever/dengue hemorrhagic fever (DF/DHF), a major public health concern in tropical and subtropical regions. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of dengue pathogenesis, researchers analyzed the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients with primary dengue infection at three stages: early febrile, defervescence, and convalescence. Using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, the study identified 60 differential metabolites, including free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. The analysis revealed perturbed metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and steroid hormone pathway, suggesting a multifactorial nature of human host responses.

The study found that phospholipids and sphingolipids were significantly perturbed during the early stages of infection and normalized to control levels at the convalescent stage, suggesting their potential utility as prognostic markers. The analysis revealed early anti-inflammatory responses working in concert to modulate early pro-inflammatory processes, preventing the host from developing pathologies due to excessive or prolonged inflammation. The study provides a detailed description of metabolome changes in patients with acute dengue infection and offers a global molecular view of the underlying mechanisms of symptom manifestation. The findings suggest that metabolites identified in this study could be used to monitor disease progression and evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.
Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent decades, but significant gaps remain in diagnostic and treatment tools. To better understand German contributions to NTD research, a study analyzed bibliometric data from published research between 2002 and 2012. The study identified 1,187 publications with at least one German author affiliation out of 26,833 worldwide, and extracted 4,007 individual authors and 863 research institutions to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries and Brazil, while collaborations with African partners were scattered. NTD research within Germany was distributed among 220 research institutions, with strong performers identified on an individual level using classic and social network analysis parameters.

The study found that the share of NTD publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other fields of medical research, highlighting the need to identify barriers and expand Germany's research activities towards NTDs. A geospatial analysis of research collaborations with partners abroad can support decisions to strengthen research capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The study's findings contribute to the prioritization of efforts in German NTD research at a time of impending local and global policy decisions. The use of free tools to analyze research processes and output can facilitate data-driven health policies.
Haiti's Neglected Tropical Disease (NTD) program has made significant progress in controlling lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) since 2000. A strong mass drug administration (MDA) program, led by the Ministry of Public Health and Population and its international partners, achieved 100% geographical coverage in 2012, exceeding the epidemiological targets of 65% for LF and 75% for STH. The program's success can be attributed to several key elements, including community awareness through a multi-channel communication campaign, community trust in voluntary drug distributors, directly observed treatment, easy access to treatment posts, and quality data collection. These strategies have resulted in a significant reduction in the burden of infection, with 45 communes reaching the target threshold for stopping treatment for LF. The program has also established a strong foundation for ongoing STH control. By leveraging sustained international support, Haiti's MDA campaign has made steady progress toward LF elimination and is poised to address future challenges, such as maintaining control of STH infections after the community-based LF treatment platform ceases and ensuring morbidity management for patients with lymphatic filarial disease. The program's success highlights the importance of community awareness, trust, and access to treatment in achieving high treatment coverage and reducing the burden of NTDs.
Researchers have investigated the role of the master regulator CtrA in controlling the cell cycle of Sinorhizobium meliloti, a type of bacteria that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume plants to fix nitrogen. In this relationship, S. meliloti undergoes significant cellular differentiation, including genome amplification, cell branching, and loss of reproductive capacity. The researchers found that depleting CtrA in S. meliloti leads to cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to what is observed in nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. They also discovered that the cell cycle-regulated proteolytic degradation of CtrA is essential in S. meliloti, suggesting a possible mechanism for CtrA depletion in differentiated bacteroids. Using a combination of ChIP-Seq and gene expression microarray analysis, the researchers found that S. meliloti CtrA regulates similar processes as C. crescentus CtrA, but through different target genes. For example, S. meliloti CtrA does not control the expression of the Fts complex to control the timing of cell division, but instead negatively regulates the septum-inhibiting Min system. These findings provide valuable insights into how highly conserved genetic networks can evolve to fit the diverse lifestyles of different bacteria. The study's model of CtrA cell cycle regulation in S. meliloti will be crucial in understanding how the bacterial cell cycle is modulated by plant factors during the symbiosis.
Researchers have identified a key factor in the ability of the bacterium Francisella tularensis to cause disease. This bacterium causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease that can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or contaminated water. To survive and multiply inside host cells, Francisella tularensis needs to obtain essential nutrients, including the amino acid cysteine. A team of scientists discovered that the bacterium uses an enzyme called γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) to break down glutathione, a molecule found in host cells, into cysteine. This process allows Francisella tularensis to obtain the cysteine it needs to grow and multiply inside host cells. The researchers created a mutant strain of the bacterium that was unable to produce GGT and found that it was severely impaired in its ability to multiply inside host cells and cause disease in mice. By adding cysteine to the mutant strain's growth medium, the researchers were able to restore its ability to multiply, suggesting that GGT is essential for Francisella tularensis to obtain cysteine from its surroundings. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Francisella tularensis adapts to its host environment and highlights the importance of GGT in the bacterium's ability to cause disease.
Researchers studied how two types of Leishmania parasites, Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major, interact with each other inside host cells. Leishmania parasites have two forms: a long, flagellated form that lives outside the host and a round, amastigote form that lives inside the host's cells. The amastigotes live in a specialized compartment called a parasitophorous vacuole (PV). Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes live in large PVs that can contain many parasites, while Leishmania major amastigotes live in small, tight PVs.

The researchers infected mouse macrophages with non-fluorescent Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes and then superinfected them with fluorescent Leishmania major amastigotes or promastigotes. They used live imaging to observe the parasites and found that PVs containing Leishmania major promastigotes fused with pre-established Leishmania amazonensis PVs. However, PVs containing Leishmania major amastigotes did not fuse with Leishmania amazonensis PVs.

In the fused PVs, Leishmania major promastigotes remained motile and multiplied, but did not differentiate into amastigotes. In contrast, Leishmania major promastigotes that were not in fused PVs differentiated into amastigotes. The researchers suggest that the PVs of different Leishmania species may have different properties that affect their ability to fuse with each other. This study provides new insights into the interactions between Leishmania parasites and their host cells, and may have implications for our understanding of Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by these parasites.
Researchers have made significant progress in developing a vaccine against HIV-1, a major goal of which is to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). These antibodies can block the virus from infecting cells by binding to native Env spikes, which are made up of trimers of gp120/gp41 heterodimers. However, the compact, sequence-diverse, and heavily glycosylated nature of these trimers makes it difficult for the immune system to recognize and neutralize the virus.

In this study, researchers investigated the ability of native, membrane-expressed JR-FL Env trimers to elicit nAbs. They found that two out of eight rabbits immunized with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers developed unusually potent nAb titers, and one out of 20 rabbits immunized with DNA expressing native Env trimer followed by a protein boost also developed potent nAb titers. These nAbs neutralized the virus by targeting quaternary epitopes, which are areas on the surface of the virus that are formed by the interaction of multiple proteins.

The researchers found that the nAbs took advantage of natural gaps in the glycan defenses of the second conserved region of JR-FL gp120, specifically the absence of a glycan at residue 197. They also found that removing the N197 glycan made 50% of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to the nAbs, showing broad neutralization. The nAbs targeted epitopes that overlap with the CD4 binding site, consistent with the role of the N197 glycan in a "glycan fence" that limits access to this region.
Researchers have identified a set of markers that can be used to monitor wound healing in patients with Buruli ulcers, a bacterial infection that causes skin lesions. Traditionally, surgery has been the primary treatment for Buruli ulcers, but a combination of antibiotics has improved treatment outcomes and reduced recurrence rates. However, managing the extensive lesions that remain after treatment has been a challenge, particularly in rural areas where the disease is most prevalent.

To better understand wound healing in Buruli ulcer patients, researchers analyzed tissue samples from eight patients before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. They used immunohistochemistry to identify markers associated with connective tissue formation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation. The study found that certain proteins, such as α-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, pro-collagen 1, tenascin, and cytokeratin 16, are suitable for monitoring wound healing in Buruli ulcers.

The researchers observed that myofibroblasts, a type of cell involved in wound healing, emerged during the healing process and produced extracellular matrix proteins. They also found that the mTor pathway, a cellular signaling pathway, was activated in myofibroblasts, indicating its potential role in wound healing. The study suggests that these markers can be used to monitor wound healing in Buruli ulcer patients and may help identify the underlying causes of delayed healing in some patients. Further research is needed to investigate the role of the mTor pathway in wound healing and to develop more effective treatments for Buruli ulcers.
Researchers have discovered a link between impulse conduction and mitochondrial transport in adult mammalian peripheral nerves. Mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, play a crucial role in meeting the high energy demands of neurons, particularly in areas far from the cell body. To study this relationship, scientists used confocal imaging to observe mitochondrial movement and distribution in the saphenous nerves of anaesthetized mice. They found that low-frequency electrical stimulation increased mitochondrial traffic in both anterograde (moving away from the cell body) and retrograde (moving towards the cell body) directions. However, higher frequency conduction, within a physiological range of 50 Hz, significantly increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic, but not retrograde, by rapidly increasing the number of mobile mitochondria and their velocity.

The study also showed that topical application of capsaicin to the skin innervated by the saphenous nerve increased mitochondrial traffic in both myelinated and unmyelinated axons. Furthermore, stationary mitochondria in axons conducting at higher frequency became shorter, suggesting that they may supply additional mitochondria to the trafficking population through enhanced fission. The findings suggest that the peripheral terminals of sensory axons are sites of particularly high metabolic demand during physiological high-frequency conduction, and that increased anterograde mitochondrial traffic may be a mechanism to ensure a uniform increase in mitochondrial density along the length of axons during high impulse load.
Researchers studied a genetic disorder called spondylocarpotarsal synostosis (SCT), which causes progressive vertebral fusions and is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the Filamin B (FLNB) gene. They used a mouse model to investigate the disease mechanisms and found that the intervertebral discs (IVDs) of mice lacking FLNB undergo rapid and progressive degeneration during postnatal development. This degeneration is due to abnormal cell fate changes in the IVD, particularly in the annulus fibrosus (AF) cells, which lose their fibroblast-like characteristics and acquire the molecular and phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chondrocytes.

The researchers found that this change is characterized by hallmarks of endochondral-like ossification, including alterations in collagen matrix, expression of Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossification of the disc tissue. They also discovered that the conversion of AF cells into chondrocytes is coincident with upregulated TGFβ signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP-induced p38 signaling, as well as sustained activation of canonical and noncanonical target genes p21 and Ctgf.

The study suggests that FLNB is involved in attenuating TGFβ/BMP signaling and influencing AF cell fate. The researchers also found that the IVD disruptions in FLNB-deficient mice resemble aging degenerative discs, providing new insights into the molecular causes of vertebral fusions and disc degeneration.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which viruses can evade the immune system. The Thogoto virus (THOV) targets a protein called TFIIB, which is essential for the recruitment of the polymerase complex to gene promoters. This complex is necessary for the expression of many genes, including those involved in the immune response. By sequestering TFIIB in the cytoplasm, THOV impairs the recruitment of the polymerase complex to certain genes, specifically those that require de novo recruitment. As a result, the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral effector molecules is reduced, while the expression of negative regulators and tissue repair factors is increased. This allows the virus to create a tolerogenic environment that favors its survival and replication.

The study found that targeting TFIIB specifically affects the expression of a limited number of genes, while leaving other cellular processes intact. This is in contrast to other viruses that target the polymerase complex, which can lead to general inhibition of gene expression. The researchers propose that targeting TFIIB may be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation. By inhibiting TFIIB activity, it may be possible to modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and antiviral effector molecules without affecting general gene expression or cellular homeostasis.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) infection of primary human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) causes cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2-phase. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral DNA replication, but this response is not necessary for cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. The NS1 protein of B19V is a key factor in disrupting the cell cycle, and its C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD2) is responsible for G2-phase arrest. Research has shown that the NS1 TAD2 domain activates the ATR-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway, leading to cell cycle arrest at G2-phase. ATR activation phosphorylates CDC25C, which in turn inactivates the cyclin B/CDK1 complex without affecting its nuclear import. The ATR-CHK1-CDC25C-CDK1 pathway is activated during B19V infection of EPCs, and ATR activation plays a crucial role in B19V infection-induced G2-phase arrest. The study used doxycycline-inducible B19V-permissive UT7/Epo-S1 cell lines that express NS1 or NS1mTAD2 to examine the function of the TAD2 domain during G2-phase arrest. The results confirm that the NS1 TAD2 domain plays a pivotal role in NS1-induced G2-phase arrest.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a range of diseases, from mild to life-threatening. A key feature of severe dengue is vascular leakage, which occurs when the lining of blood vessels becomes damaged, allowing fluid to leak into tissues. Researchers have been studying how DENV's nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) contributes to this process. NS1 has been shown to disrupt the endothelial glycocalyx, a protective layer on the surface of blood vessels, and trigger the release of inflammatory cytokines. However, the exact mechanisms behind NS1-induced vascular leakage are not fully understood.

In this study, researchers investigated the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways in DENV NS1-induced vascular leakage. They found that blocking inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha and IL-6, did not prevent NS1-induced vascular leakage in mice. In contrast, using inhibitors that target molecules involved in glycocalyx disruption blocked NS1-induced vascular leakage. These findings suggest that DENV NS1-induced vascular leakage is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on endothelial glycocalyx components.

The study's results have implications for the development of new treatments for severe dengue disease. Targeting enzymes that contribute to the degradation of glycocalyx components may help prevent vascular leakage and reduce the severity of the disease. Further research is needed to confirm the role of the glycocalyx in dengue pathogenesis and to explore potential therapeutic targets.
In budding yeast, the integrity of the septin ring at the bud neck is crucial for cytokinesis, proper spindle positioning, and the spindle position checkpoint (SPOC). The SPOC delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis if the anaphase spindle does not properly align with the division axis. Researchers have found that the ubiquitin-ligases Dma1 and Dma2 control septin dynamics and the SPOC by promoting the efficient recruitment of the Elm1 kinase to the bud neck. Elm1, in turn, stabilizes the septin ring and activates the Kin4 kinase, which is essential for the SPOC. In cells lacking Dma1 and Dma2, Elm1 is not properly recruited to the bud neck, leading to reduced Kin4 activation and SPOC failure. However, artificially recruiting Elm1 to the bud neck in these cells is sufficient to restore a normal septin ring, proper spindle positioning, and a proficient SPOC response. This suggests a tight link between septin dynamics and SPOC function. The researchers propose a model in which Dma1 and Dma2 regulate both septin ring dynamics and the SPOC by promoting Elm1 recruitment to the bud neck. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the SPOC and highlights the importance of the bud neck in maintaining proper cell division.
Scientists have long wondered how humans have adapted to live in diverse climates around the world. To answer this question, researchers conducted a genome-wide scan to identify genetic variations associated with climate. They analyzed data from 61 worldwide populations and found that certain genetic variations are more common in areas with extreme climates. These variations are linked to traits such as skin pigmentation, autoimmune diseases, and responses to UV radiation, infection, and cancer. The study suggests that climate has played a significant role in shaping the distribution of genetic variation in humans.

The researchers found that genetic variations associated with diseases of the immune response, such as autoimmune diseases, are more common in areas with extreme climates. This is likely due to the fact that climate influences the distribution of human pathogens. The study also identified genetic variations associated with pigmentation and response to UV radiation, which are more common in areas with high levels of UV radiation. Additionally, the researchers found that genetic variations associated with cancer are more common in areas with extreme climates.

The study's findings suggest that humans have adapted to their environments through natural selection. The researchers identified a subset of genetic variations that are strongly associated with climate variables and are also linked to traits such as pigmentation and autoimmune disease. These findings provide evidence that climate has played a significant role in shaping the distribution of genetic variation in humans. The study's results have implications for our understanding of human evolution and adaptation to different environments.
Researchers studied the effects of a specific genetic mutation, N588K, on the heart's electrical activity in people with a condition called short QT syndrome (SQTS). SQTS is a rare condition that increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythms and sudden death. The study used computer models to simulate how the N588K mutation affects the heart's electrical activity.

The researchers found that the mutation shortens the time it takes for the heart to recover between beats, making it more susceptible to abnormal rhythms. However, they also discovered that in certain areas of the heart, the mutation actually increases the risk of abnormal electrical activity. This is because the mutation reduces the differences in electrical activity between different parts of the heart, making it easier for abnormal electrical waves to form and spread.

The study used computer models to simulate the effects of the mutation on the heart's electrical activity in different scenarios, including 1D, 2D, and 3D models of the heart. The results showed that the N588K mutation facilitates the formation and maintenance of abnormal electrical waves in the heart, increasing the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.

The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying SQTS and the role of the N588K mutation in increasing the risk of abnormal heart rhythms. The findings have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of SQTS, and highlight the need for further research into the genetic and electrical mechanisms underlying this condition.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand the collective behavior of animals, specifically zebrafish, using a deep attention network. This model is able to predict the motion of individual fish in a group while also providing insight into the underlying rules governing their behavior. The model is organized in modules, allowing it to balance complexity and predictability. When tested on simulated trajectories, the model was able to recover the ground-truth interaction rule used to generate them, as well as the number of interacting neighbors. When applied to experimental data from groups of 60-100 zebrafish, the model found that interactions between pairs of fish can be described as repulsive, attractive, or alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond to alignment or alignment mixed with repulsion at close distances. The model also showed that each fish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average of its neighbors, with weights higher for neighbors that are close, in a collision path, or moving faster in frontal and lateral locations. Additionally, the model found that the number of interacting individuals is dynamic and typically in the range of 8-22, with 1-10 more important ones. This suggests that each animal makes decisions by dynamically selecting information from the collective.
Researchers used a phylodynamic approach to study the fitness cost of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. They analyzed viral sequence data from over 10% of ART-naive patients in Europe who were infected with drug-resistant HIV-1. The study found that the 90M mutation in the protease gene had a significantly higher fitness than drug-sensitive strains, while the 67N, 70R, 184V, and 219Q mutations associated with resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors were less fit than sensitive strains. The remaining resistance mutations studied did not have a significant effect on viral transmissibility. The researchers developed a novel phylodynamic approach to estimate the transmission fitness cost of drug resistance mutations, which can be useful in assessing the risk of transmitted drug resistance in resource-limited settings where resistance testing is possible but epidemiological, demographic, and clinical data are missing. This approach allows for the direct quantification of population-level fitness costs of HIV resistance mutations from viral sequence data alone. The study highlights the importance of understanding the dynamics of HIV resistance evolution and the transmission fitness of viral lineages, which is crucial for the success of global HIV-containment programs, such as test-and-treat strategies.
Researchers have found that a protein complex called Elongator plays a crucial role in helping cells respond to stress. Elongator is involved in modifying certain transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are essential for translating genetic code into proteins. The study, conducted in fission yeast, discovered that Elongator's ability to modify tRNAs is critical for the cell's ability to survive oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when cells are exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species, which can damage cellular components.

The researchers found that cells lacking Elongator's Sin3/Elp3 subunit were unable to modify a specific tRNA called tRNALysUUU, leading to inefficient translation of certain stress-induced mRNAs. These mRNAs contain a high number of lysine-coding codons, which are essential for the cell's response to stress. The study showed that overexpressing tRNALysUUU in cells lacking Elongator's Sin3/Elp3 subunit restored their ability to survive oxidative stress.

The researchers also found that other tRNA-modifying activities, such as those carried out by the Ctu1-Ctu2 complex, are essential for normal tolerance to oxidative stress. The study suggests that Elongator's role in tRNA modification is critical for the cell's ability to respond to stress, and that defects in this process can lead to stress sensitivity. The findings have implications for understanding how cells respond to stress and how defects in tRNA modification can lead to disease.
Researchers have discovered a new function of the Nef protein in HIV-1, which makes the virus resistant to certain neutralizing antibodies. These antibodies, 2F5 and 4E10, target the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the Env protein on the surface of the virus. The study found that Nef increases the resistance of HIV-1 to these antibodies by up to 50-fold. This effect is specific to 2F5 and 4E10, as Nef does not affect the virus's sensitivity to other neutralizing antibodies. The researchers also found that this activity is conserved in Nef proteins from different types of lentiviruses, including HIV-1 and SIV. The study suggests that Nef alters the recognition of the MPER by 2F5 and 4E10, making it harder for the antibodies to bind to the virus. This new function of Nef has important implications for understanding how HIV-1 evades the immune system and how it contributes to the progression of AIDS.
Researchers studied the interaction between the liver fluke parasite, Opisthorchis viverrini, and its intermediate host, the snail Bithynia siamensis goniomphalos. This parasite causes a type of liver cancer called cholangiocarcinoma, which is a major public health concern in Southeast Asia. To understand how the parasite infects the snail, the researchers compared the gene expression profiles of infected and uninfected snails using high-throughput sequencing technology. They found 7,655 genes that were differently expressed in infected snails, including genes involved in immune defense mechanisms. Some of these genes, such as those encoding proteases, were down-regulated in infected snails, while others, like heat-shock proteins and actins, were up-regulated. This suggests that the parasite may suppress the snail's immune response to facilitate infection. The study provides a foundation for further research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the snail-parasite interaction and could lead to the discovery of new targets for controlling the spread of the parasite. The dataset generated in this study is a valuable resource for future research on snail-parasite interactions and the development of strategies to prevent liver cancer caused by Opisthorchis viverrini.
Researchers investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1) in susceptibility to leprosy, a public health issue in Brazil. They analyzed CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels in 213 leprosy patients and 297 controls. The study found that individuals with a specific recombinant haplotype, which includes the rs3849266*T and rs3737002*T variants, had twice the susceptibility to leprosy. This haplotype was also associated with lower levels of soluble CR1 in paucibacillary patients, which may reduce the anti-inflammatory response. Furthermore, the study found that the most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibacillary clinical form of leprosy and was associated with higher gene expression. The researchers also found an inverse correlation between soluble CR1 levels and mannose-binding lectin, a molecule that initiates the lectin pathway of complement. The study suggests that CR1 polymorphisms play a regulatory role in mRNA and soluble CR1 levels, with haplotype-specific effects that increase susceptibility to leprosy by enhancing parasite phagocytosis and inflammation. This is the first study to specifically analyze the influence of CR1 haplotypes, mRNA expression, and soluble CR1 levels in leprosy susceptibility.
Researchers have discovered significant differences in metabolic and genetic biomarkers between males and females. By analyzing data from over 3,300 individuals, the study found that 102 out of 131 measured metabolites had different concentrations in males and females. These metabolites include amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, acylcarnitines, and C6-sugars. The study also identified specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes that contribute to these sex-specific differences.

The researchers used a combination of metabolomic profiling and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to investigate the effects of genetic variation on metabolic processes. They found that certain genetic variants in the CPS1 locus, which codes for carbamoyl-phosphate synthase 1, had a significant impact on glycine levels in males and females. The study's findings suggest that sex-specific effects should be considered in the design and interpretation of biomedical research.

The study's results provide new insights into the sex-specific architecture of the human metabolome and shed light on biochemical mechanisms that may explain differences in disease susceptibility and progression between males and females. The findings also highlight the importance of considering sex-specific effects in biomedical research, particularly in the study of complex diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disorders.
Biomedical researchers use genome-scale metabolic networks to model how genetic variations affect cellular behavior. These models rely on optimization algorithms to predict the active metabolic state of a cell under specific conditions. However, the choice of objective function in these algorithms is crucial, as it reflects the underlying biological hypothesis. A common approach is to use a linear combination of selected fluxes, but this method is sensitive to the stoichiometry representation of the metabolic network. Stoichiometry refers to the quantitative relationship between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. Different numerical representations of stoichiometry can lead to different simulation results, making biological interpretation ambiguous. To address this issue, researchers propose a new method called Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiMBl). MiMBl decouples the artifacts of stoichiometry representation from the formulation of objective functions by using metabolite turnovers instead of fluxes. This approach allows for more accurate and unambiguous modeling results. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of MiMBl by simulating perturbed metabolic networks and elucidating the mechanistic basis of genetic interactions in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. By using MiMBl, researchers can expand the scope of metabolic modeling and gain a deeper understanding of how genetic variations affect cellular behavior.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the distribution of plague, a highly virulent disease caused by Yersinia pestis, and the population genetics of the black rat (Rattus rattus), the main reservoir of the disease in Madagascar. They conducted a comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure in rat populations from four geographic areas with different topographic relief profiles within the Madagascan plague focus. The results showed that rat populations displayed a more marked genetic structure with increasing relief, as expected. However, the relationship between seroprevalence data and genetic structure differed between areas, suggesting that plague distribution is not solely related to the effective dispersal of rats.

The study found that plague seroprevalence levels in rat populations mimicked those previously reported for humans, and genetic diversity estimates suggested that plague epizootics had only a weak impact on rat population sizes. In the highlands of Madagascar, plague dissemination could not be accounted for solely by the effective dispersal of the reservoir, suggesting that human social activities may also play a role in spreading the disease in rat and human populations. The study aimed to answer two questions: whether the distribution of plague seroprevalence in rat populations differs between plateau and mountain areas, and whether the fine-scale genetic structure of rat populations is higher in mountain areas than in plateaus. The results suggest that plague spread in rat and human populations can be partly related to the population genetic structure of the reservoir, but also to human social activities.
Researchers studied how the human immune system responds to certain proteins on the surface of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni. This parasite causes schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The researchers focused on a family of proteins called Ly6, which are found on the surface of the parasite and play a crucial role in its ability to infect humans. They identified 11 members of the Ly6 family, including three new proteins, and found that two of these proteins, SmLy6A and SmLy6B, are present on the surface of the parasite and can be recognized by the human immune system.

The researchers analyzed blood samples from a group of Ugandan men infected with the parasite and found that some of them had antibodies against SmLy6A and SmLy6B. They also found that the levels of these antibodies decreased after the men were treated with praziquantel, a medication used to treat schistosomiasis. This suggests that the parasite's surface proteins, including SmLy6A and SmLy6B, are targets for the human immune system and that treatment with praziquantel may help to reduce the parasite's ability to infect humans. The study expands our understanding of the parasite's surface proteins and how the human immune system responds to them, which could lead to the development of new treatments or vaccines for schistosomiasis.
Researchers created a computer simulation to study how cells in the Drosophila retina develop their shape during tissue formation. They focused on the role of N-cadherin, a protein that helps cells stick together. The simulation showed that N-cadherin plays a crucial role in determining the shape of cells in the retina. The model was able to reproduce the shapes of normal and mutant cells, and it highlighted the importance of the timing of N-cadherin expression and cell-cell contact remodeling. The simulation also suggested that N-cadherin is recycled from inactive to active interfaces, which affects the strength of cell-cell adhesion.

The researchers tested the model using experimental data from cells with altered levels of N-cadherin. They found that the model accurately described the shape changes in these mutant cells and distinguished between different mechanisms of how N-cadherin levels are controlled. The model also incorporated dynamic features of tissue formation, such as the temporal sequence of N-cadherin expression and cell-cell contact remodeling, without requiring additional free parameters.

The study provides new insights into the role of N-cadherin in cell morphology and tissue formation. It highlights the importance of considering the distribution and dynamic properties of cadherin molecules in understanding how they control cell geometry. The findings have implications for our understanding of tissue development and the role of adhesion proteins in shaping cell morphology.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the role of a protein called MT1-MMP in the degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by cancer cells. MT1-MMP is a key enzyme that helps cancer cells invade surrounding tissues by breaking down the ECM. To understand how MT1-MMP works, the researchers used a technique called FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching) to track the movement of MT1-MMP on the surface of cancer cells. They found that MT1-MMP is rapidly turned over, or replaced, on the cell surface, and that this turnover is crucial for the enzyme's ability to degrade the ECM.

The researchers then used their computational model to simulate the behavior of MT1-MMP and the ECM degradation process. The model successfully replicated the results of the FRAP experiments and predicted that inhibiting the turnover of MT1-MMP would reduce ECM degradation. This was confirmed by experiments that showed that blocking the turnover of MT1-MMP with drugs reduced ECM degradation.

The study suggests that the rapid turnover of MT1-MMP is essential for its ability to degrade the ECM, and that this process is critical for cancer cell invasion. The researchers also found that both the proteolytic activity of MT1-MMP and its turnover contribute to ECM degradation, and that reducing both factors simultaneously has a greater impact on ECM degradation than reducing either one alone. This study provides a new tool for designing and evaluating strategies to prevent cancer cell invasion.
Researchers studied how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) evolves and spreads within the body of infected individuals. They used a simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) in macaques to mimic the behavior of HIV in humans. The study aimed to understand how drug-resistant strains of the virus arise and spread to different parts of the body.

The researchers collected virus samples from the blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina of four macaques at multiple time points. They found that the virus in these different parts of the body was not evenly distributed, and that the virus in the blood and lymph nodes was more similar to each other than to the virus in the gut and vagina. The study also showed that the virus in the gut had a faster turnover rate than in the blood, and that the virus in the gut retained fewer wild-type viruses than in other parts of the body.

The researchers found that drug-resistant strains of the virus emerged and spread rapidly across different parts of the body, often through multiple independent mutations. They also found that the blood and lymph nodes were rarely compartmentalized, meaning that the virus in these areas was not isolated from the rest of the body. The study's findings suggest that previous studies may have underestimated the complexity of HIV evolution within the body, and that the virus in the gut may play a key role in the development of drug resistance.
Researchers used mathematical modeling to explore the role of feedback regulation in tissue morphogenesis. They found that a specific type of feedback, where both positive and negative diffusible signals act on stem and/or progenitor cells, can lead to unique growth behaviors. These behaviors include bistable or bi-modal growth, ultrasensitivity to external growth cues, local growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and the triggering of self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. This occurs through the control of stem or progenitor self-renewal, rather than the regulation of cell cycle speeds. The study suggests that feedback regulation of stem or progenitor cell self-renewal can lead to growth bistability or bimodality, with ultrasensitive switching between high and low (or zero) growth states. The simultaneous presence of saturable positive and negative feedback is a necessary condition for this behavior. The researchers also found that this type of feedback can lead to the spontaneous emergence of spatially dynamic behaviors, manifesting as sharply localized differences in net growth. This can drive the formation of induced or spontaneous bulges, buds, and fingers, which are the basic building blocks of many types of morphogenesis.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide association study to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by nearsightedness due to excessive eye elongation. The study analyzed data from 45,771 European participants and identified 22 significant genetic associations with the age of myopia onset. Ten of these associations were novel and replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 individuals. The findings suggest that multiple genetic factors contribute to the development of myopia, pointing to complex interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina. One association was found in the gene PRSS56, previously linked to abnormally small eyes, while others were linked to genes involved in the regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, growth and guidance of retinal ganglion cells, and neuronal signaling or development. The study's results explain 2.9% of the variance in myopia age of onset, indicating that many genetic factors remain to be discovered. Notably, some genetic associations with myopia age of onset were stronger than those previously detected with refractive error, suggesting that the strength of genetic associations may depend on the specific phenotype under study. The study's findings highlight the complexity of myopia development and the need for further research to understand the underlying mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the role of body curvature feedback in the swimming behavior of lampreys, a type of eel-like fish. Lampreys have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that controls muscle activity for locomotion and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. The study used a computer model to simulate lamprey swimming and tested two types of curvature-based feedback: directional and magnitude feedback. Directional feedback excites or inhibits muscle activity on one side of the body, while magnitude feedback provides a symmetric effect on both sides. The results showed that directional feedback does not affect the frequency of muscle activity, but changes the duration of muscle activity. Magnitude feedback, on the other hand, increases the frequency of muscle activity and reduces the energetic cost of swimming when the gain is high and positive. The study found that the same magnitude of curvature-based feedback can cause distinct differences in swimming performance, depending on its functional form. The findings suggest that the lamprey's closed-loop neuromechanical system plays a crucial role in shaping the pattern of muscle activity and adapting to the environment. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between sensory feedback, muscle activity, and swimming behavior in lampreys. The results have implications for understanding the neural control of locomotion in other animals, including humans.
Researchers studied how different strains of HIV compete with each other in a population. They found that the first strain to colonize a population has an advantage over new strains that are introduced later. This "first comer advantage" slows down the spread of new strains and limits the diversification of the epidemic. The study used computer simulations to model the spread of HIV over a network of sexual contacts. The simulations showed that the second strain was unable to invade the population on a time scale relevant to the history of the HIV pandemic, unless it had a significant advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. The simulations also found that the inhibition effect was weaker if the second strain was introduced while the first strain was still in its growth phase. The researchers tested different mechanisms of interference, such as the inhibition of superinfection and the depletion of highly connected individuals in the network, and found that they contributed to the inhibition effect. The study suggests that the global phylogeography of HIV, which is characterized by compartmentalized local epidemics dominated by a single subtype, can be explained by the first comer advantage. The findings may also influence the future evolution of the pandemic.
Biologists have long been fascinated by how muscle cells, or myocytes, organize their internal structures to enable movement and contraction. A new study has made significant progress in understanding this complex process by developing a computational model that simulates how myocytes organize their cytoskeleton, a network of protein filaments that provides structural support and enables muscle contraction. The researchers found that the organization of the cytoskeleton is influenced by the shape and boundaries of the cell's extracellular space, or the space outside the cell membrane.

The study focused on neonatal rat ventricular myocytes, a type of heart muscle cell, and found that the cytoskeleton organizes through two distinct processes: the interaction between actin fibers, premyofibrils, and focal adhesions, and the cooperative alignment and parallel bundling of nascent myofibrils. The researchers also discovered that a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton, with a positive feedback loop playing a crucial role in initiating the break in symmetry that polarizes the contractile cytoskeleton.

The study's findings suggest that muscle cells rely on extracellular spatial cues to efficiently and functionally organize their myofibrils, which are the contractile units of muscle cells. The research has implications for our understanding of muscle development and disease, and could potentially inform the development of new treatments for muscle-related disorders. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex process of muscle cell organization and highlights the importance of the extracellular space in shaping the internal structure of muscle cells.
Researchers have been exploring the use of the symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission by infecting Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. To better understand the invasive potential of Wolbachia, scientists studied the wMel strain in laboratory and field settings in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They found that the wMel strain causes strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, a high rate of maternal transmission, and has no detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. In field experiments, the researchers released Wolbachia-uninfected mosquitoes in two areas where Wolbachia will be deployed in the future and characterized the mosquito populations in relation to socio-demographic conditions. They then used mathematical models to describe the influence of urban environmental conditions on the likelihood of Wolbachia infection frequency reaching 100% following mosquito release. The results suggest that the wMel strain will likely successfully invade five distinct field sites around Rio de Janeiro, with local mosquito abundance being the most important factor influencing the spread of Wolbachia. The study's findings provide a useful framework for the ongoing field-releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti in Brazil and will likely hold similar utility for future releases in other urban landscapes. The research highlights the importance of characterizing field sites prior to the release of Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes to determine the optimal release strategy.
Researchers have identified a protein called JMJ703 that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in rice plants. This protein is a histone lysine demethylase, which means it removes methyl groups from histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4). H3K4 methylation is an important epigenetic modification that affects chromatin structure and gene expression. The researchers found that JMJ703 specifically removes all three forms of H3K4 methylation (mono-, di-, and trimethylated) and is essential for stem elongation and plant growth in rice. A loss-of-function mutation in the JMJ703 gene led to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase (CKX) genes, which may be related to the observed growth defects. The researchers also determined the crystal structure of the catalytic core domain of JMJ703 and identified key residues that interact with cofactors and the methylated H3K4 substrate. These residues are essential for the demethylase activity in vivo and are conserved in other known H3K4 demethylases. The study suggests that JMJ703 is a key regulator of gene expression in rice and may play a role in growth hormone metabolism. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in plants and have implications for understanding plant development and stress adaptation.
Researchers have identified a shared binding site in the HIV-1 capsid protein that is targeted by multiple host cell and pharmacologic ligands. These ligands, including two antiviral drugs and two host cofactors, interact with the capsid protein in a way that was previously unknown. The binding site is located at the interface between two subunits of the capsid protein, specifically at the connection between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains. This interface is only present in the fully assembled capsid, which is made up of six subunits, and is lost when the capsid is disassembled into individual subunits.

The researchers used X-ray crystallography to visualize the binding of these ligands to the capsid protein. They found that each ligand interacts with the capsid protein in a unique way, but also shares some common interactions. The host cofactors, NUP153 and CPSF6, and the antiviral drug PF74, all bind to the same interface, but use different subsets of amino acids to do so. The binding of these ligands to the capsid protein is essential for HIV-1 infection, and disrupting these interactions can prevent the virus from infecting host cells.

The researchers also found that the binding site is conformationally dynamic, meaning that it can change shape in response to the binding of different ligands. However, the binding of NUP153 or CPSF6 peptides is accommodated by only one specific conformation of the binding site. These findings provide new insights into how HIV-1 interacts with host cells and how antiviral drugs work, and could lead to the development of new treatments for HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have improved the genome assembly of the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya. The mosquito's genome is large and contains many repetitive sequences, making it difficult to assemble into a complete and accurate map. Previous attempts to map the genome resulted in 4,758 scaffolds, few of which were assigned to a specific chromosome. To address this issue, scientists used a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a cross between two strains of Aedes aegypti to generate a genetic map. This revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, where sequences from different chromosomes were found on the same scaffold. By correcting these errors, the researchers were able to assign 60% of the genome sequence to chromosomes and approximately order the scaffolds along the chromosome. They also identified large regions of suppressed recombination around the centromeres, which can extend to 47% of the chromosome. The new genome assembly was used to map a gene that makes Aedes aegypti resistant to the human parasite Brugia malayi, and a list of candidate genes that could be affecting the trait was generated. This improved genome assembly will facilitate the mapping of genes affecting disease transmission in Aedes aegypti.
Aedes aegypti, the mosquito responsible for spreading dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever, is a major target for vector control programs in tropical countries. Current surveillance methods often rely on traditional household larval surveys, despite the availability of new trapping devices. A recent study compared the effectiveness of four alternative traps - ovitraps, MosquiTRAP, Adultrap, and BioGent-Sentinel - with larval surveys in detecting mosquito density variations. The study was conducted in five mid-sized cities in Brazil, representing different tropical climate regimens.

The results showed that the House Index, a traditional measure of mosquito infestation, was consistently low in most cities. In contrast, the alternative traps were more sensitive in detecting the presence of Aedes aegypti, with trap positivity indices tending to plateau at high mosquito densities. The study found that all investigated traps performed better than the House Index in measuring seasonal variations in mosquito abundance and should be considered as complements or alternatives to larval surveys. However, the choice between traps should consider differences in cost and ease of use.

The study suggests that traps can be valuable tools in combination with vector control strategies to improve responses to dengue and other diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti. Household larval surveys and trap-based surveillance systems are not interchangeable approaches, and traps' statistical properties, such as sensitivity and specificity, should be invariant and consistently behave under both low and high abundances. The study's findings have implications for the development of trap-based surveillance programs in dengue-endemic countries.
APOBEC3G (A3G) is a human protein that plays a crucial role in restricting the replication of retroviruses, including HIV-1. A3G works by deaminating cytidines to uridines in single-stranded DNA, a process known as DNA editing or hypermutation. To understand how A3G functions, researchers studied its structure and interactions with other molecules. They found that A3G contains two cytidine deaminase domains, only one of which is known to mediate cytidine deamination. By analyzing the structure of a related protein, APOBEC2, they identified specific residues in A3G that are involved in oligomerization, or the formation of protein complexes. These residues, tyrosine-124 and tryptophan-127, are located in the N-terminal cytidine deaminase domain, which is not involved in cytidine deamination. The researchers showed that these residues are essential for A3G oligomerization and its packaging into HIV-1 virions. They also found that oligomerization is dependent on the presence of RNA, suggesting that RNA plays a central role in A3G's antiviral function. The researchers propose that RNA occupies a positively charged pocket in A3G, promoting oligomerization, packaging, and antiviral activity. This study provides new insights into the structure and function of A3G and its role in restricting HIV-1 replication.
Scientists have long sought to understand the genetic basis of complex traits, but identifying the specific genes and sequence variations responsible for these traits has proven challenging. A new study in Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, has made significant progress in this area. The researchers focused on the bric-a-brac (bab) locus, a region of the genome that affects cuticular pigmentation. They sequenced the bab region from 94 inbred lines of D. melanogaster and found that natural alleles with large effects on cuticular pigmentation are due to a cumulative impact of polymorphisms in three functional regions: a promoter, a tissue-specific enhancer, and a Polycomb response element. These polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level, affecting the expression of the bab gene. The study demonstrates that a single quantitative trait locus (QTL) can act through multiple molecular mechanisms, and that sequence variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can have significant quantitative effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. This finding has important implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits in both basic and medical genomics. The study's results also suggest that accumulation of multiple mutations at the same locus may be a common mechanism of micro- and macroevolutionary change.
Researchers have found that the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of pneumonia and other infections, has a unique ability to adapt to its environment. This adaptability is due in part to its ability to take in and incorporate new genetic material from other bacteria. The process of DNA uptake and recombination is controlled by a complex system that is triggered by the presence of a signaling molecule called competence stimulating peptide (CSP).

The study found that CSP also stimulates the production of a variety of bacteriocins, which are toxins that kill other bacteria. This cross-stimulation occurs through the increased production and secretion of a bacteriocin pheromone called BlpC, which requires a functional competence regulatory system. The researchers discovered that a specific sequence of DNA in the promoter of the BlpC gene is responsible for its upregulation by CSP.

The study used biofilm-grown bacteria to model competition and genetic exchange on the mucosal surface, and found that DNA exchange is enhanced by bacteriocin secretion. This suggests that the co-stimulation of bacteriocins and competence provides an adaptive advantage to the bacteria. The researchers also found that the regulatory pathways controlling competence and bacteriocin production have maintained a connection over time, allowing the bacteria to target and kill a wide range of potential competitors while also incorporating their DNA.
Researchers have been studying how poliovirus, a virus that affects the nervous system, hijacks the host cell's machinery to replicate itself. A key step in this process is the recruitment of ribosomes, the cellular structures responsible for protein synthesis, to the viral RNA. Two proteins, PCBP2 and SRp20, play a crucial role in this process by interacting with each other and with the viral RNA. The study found that SRp20, a protein typically found in the nucleus, relocates to the cytoplasm of infected cells, where it interacts with PCBP2. This interaction is essential for the recruitment of ribosomes to the viral RNA, allowing the virus to initiate protein synthesis. The researchers created a mutated version of SRp20 that lacks one of its functional domains and found that its expression resulted in a significant decrease in virus yield. This suggests that SRp20 is critical for poliovirus infection. The study provides new insights into the mechanism of ribosome recruitment for poliovirus infection and highlights the importance of non-canonical factors in bridging the translation machinery to the viral RNA. The findings also shed light on the role of SR proteins in linking nuclear splicing and export with translation in eukaryotic cells. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of how poliovirus manipulates the host cell's machinery to replicate itself.
Researchers conducted a genetic screen to identify genes involved in the development of the neural crest, a group of stem cells that gives rise to various cell types, including nerve cells and melanocytes. They used a mouse model with a mutation in the Sox10 gene, which is crucial for neural crest development, and exposed the mice to a chemical mutagenesis agent called ENU to induce random genetic mutations. The researchers analyzed 71 offspring and identified four heritable mutations that disrupted neural crest development. One of these mutations, called msp1, was found to be a new allele of the Erbb3 gene, which is a receptor tyrosine kinase involved in cell signaling. The msp1 mutation resulted in a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region of the Erbb3 protein, which impaired its function and led to defects in neural crest development. Biochemical analysis showed that the mutant protein was expressed on the cell surface but had reduced ligand-induced phosphorylation, highlighting the importance of the mutated residue for Erbb3 receptor function. This study demonstrates the utility of ENU mutagenesis in identifying genetic pathways involved in neural crest development and provides new insights into the role of Erbb3 in this process. The findings may contribute to a better understanding of neurocristopathies, a group of developmental disorders caused by mutations in genes involved in neural crest development.
Researchers conducted a study in a rural Ugandan fishing community to investigate the factors influencing susceptibility to Schistosoma mansoni infection, a parasitic disease caused by a type of flatworm. The study aimed to understand how age, sex, ethnicity, and IgE immune responses affect the risk of reinfection after treatment with anti-helminth drugs. The researchers used a multidisciplinary approach, combining data from a longitudinal reinfection study with individual-level cercarial exposure scores to account for variations in exposure to the parasite.

The study found that ethnic and sex-related variations in Schistosoma mansoni reinfection were due to differences in cercarial exposure, rather than biological differences in susceptibility to infection. However, age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure and appeared to be linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 immune responses to the parasite's tegumental antigen SmTAL1. The study highlights the importance of taking a multidisciplinary approach in complex field settings to understand the ecology of a population and make more robust conclusions.

The researchers used previously derived individual-level cercarial exposure scores to adjust for variations in exposure in the community, which is highly endemic for schistosomiasis. This approach allowed them to investigate the roles of age and sex in susceptibility to Schistosoma infection and whether the Alur ethnic group is more susceptible to infection. The study also explored whether schistosome-specific IgE or IgG4 immune responses could account for any remaining variation in susceptibility to reinfection.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPGs) and the actual number of worms in people infected with Clonorchis sinensis, a type of liver fluke parasite. They collected stool samples from 60 residents in a region of Korea where the parasite is common and treated them with a medication called praziquantel. The next day, the participants were given a purgative to induce bowel movements, and adult worms were collected from their feces. The researchers found a positive correlation between the number of EPGs and the number of worms, meaning that as the EPGs increased, so did the number of worms. They also found that worm recovery rates were higher in people with higher EPGs, with 73.7% of those with EPGs over 1,000 recovering worms, compared to 9.7% of those with EPGs between 1-1,000. The study estimated that at least 110 worms are present in a person with an EPG of around 3,000, and that each worm produces around 4,000 eggs per day. This research provides valuable information on the relationship between EPGs and worm burden in human clonorchiasis, which can help improve diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
Researchers have developed a new approach to combat the growing problem of anti-fungal drug resistance. They used a model organism, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, to identify potential targets for combination therapies. By performing an unbiased genome-wide screen, they found 18 genetic mutants that were synthetically lethal when combined with a gain-of-function allele of the PDR1 gene, which is responsible for fluconazole resistance in the human fungal pathogen Candida glabrata. One of these mutants, lacking the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5, was further investigated. The researchers found that deleting or inhibiting Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glabrata cells expressing PDR1+ alleles, and also inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata isolates in evolution experiments. This suggests that targeting Gcn5, a synthetically lethal interacting partner of PDR1, could be a new way to treat drug-resistant infections. The researchers confirmed their findings in C. glabrata by showing that deleting or inhibiting Gcn5 was lethal in cells expressing the PDR1+L280F fluconazole-resistant allele. They also demonstrated that chemically inhibiting Gcn5 prevented the growth of C. glabrata strains expressing PDR1+L280F. This study provides proof of concept that synthetically lethal genetic screens can identify novel candidate proteins that can be targeted to effectively treat drug-resistant infections.
Researchers studied how poliovirus (PV) interacts with host cells to replicate and assemble new virus particles. They found that PV induces the formation of distinct membranous structures, or organelles, at different times during the infection process. These organelles contain a type of lipid called phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) and are involved in genome replication and virus assembly. The researchers used two PV mutants, EG and GG, which have impaired proteolytic processing of a key viral protein, to investigate the formation of these organelles. They found that changes in the PI4P pool occurred as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even in the presence of a replication inhibitor, and were accompanied by the formation of membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters, which are thought to be involved in virus assembly, appeared in the perinuclear region of the cell at 3 hours post-infection. The GG mutant was unable to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular clusters, resulting in a nearly 5-log reduction in infectious virus production. These findings suggest that PV induces temporally distinct organelles for genome replication and virus assembly, and that the efficiency of the replication-to-assembly-organelle conversion may be influenced by the rate of viral protein processing. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between PV and host cells during infection.
Researchers have discovered new compounds that can kill the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease that affects millions of people in Latin America. The compounds, known as cruzain inhibitors, work by blocking an enzyme called cruzain, which is essential for the parasite's survival. Using a combination of computer simulations and laboratory experiments, the researchers identified 12 non-peptidic compounds that can bind to cruzain and inhibit its activity. One of these compounds, Nequimed42, was found to be particularly effective, killing the parasite at a concentration 10 times lower than the current standard treatment, benznidazole.

The researchers also discovered that the 2-acetamidothiophene-3-carboxamide group is responsible for the enzyme-inhibiting and trypanocidal activity of these compounds. By simplifying the structure of Nequimed42, they created a smaller compound, Nequimed176, which is a promising candidate for further development as a new treatment for Chagas disease. The discovery of these new compounds is an important step towards finding more effective and safer treatments for Chagas disease, which is a significant public health problem in many Latin American countries. The researchers' approach, which combines computer simulations and laboratory experiments, is a promising strategy for discovering new treatments for other diseases as well.
Researchers have developed two non-viral DNA-based antigen formulations as potential vaccines against yellow fever (YF) virus. The YF virus is a significant source of morbidity and mortality in tropical areas, and the current attenuated vaccine has rare but potentially fatal side effects. The new DNA-based vaccines encode the full-length envelope protein of the YF virus, either on its own or fused to a lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal. These formulations were tested in mice and found to induce strong T-cell responses against almost all epitopes generated by the current YF 17DD vaccine. The vaccine that fused the envelope protein to the lysosomal-associated membrane protein signal (pL/YFE) performed best, also stimulating high levels of neutralizing antibodies comparable to those elicited by the 17DD vaccine. Importantly, the pL/YFE vaccine provided 100% protection against the YF virus in mice challenged with the virus. These results suggest that the pL/YFE DNA vaccine is a promising candidate for further development as a safe and effective vaccine against YF virus. The study expands our understanding of the immune responses to the YF virus and provides a potential alternative to the current vaccine.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called SlmA in the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera. This protein, previously known for its role in cell division, is now found to be a direct activator of genes involved in chitobiose utilization. Chitobiose is a sugar molecule found in chitin, a key component of the shells of crustaceans and other marine animals. Vibrio cholerae uses chitobiose as a food source in its natural environment, and the ability to utilize chitobiose is essential for the bacterium's survival and spread.

The researchers used a genetic screening technique to identify SlmA as a regulator of the chb operon, a group of genes involved in chitobiose uptake and breakdown. They found that SlmA binds directly to the promoter region of the chb operon, a specific DNA sequence that controls the expression of the genes. This interaction is necessary for the activation of the chb operon and for the bacterium's ability to grow on chitobiose.

Interestingly, SlmA is a member of the TetR family of proteins, which are typically transcriptional repressors. However, in this case, SlmA acts as a transcriptional activator. The researchers also found that the ability of SlmA to bind to DNA is essential for its role in activating the chb operon, but its ability to occlude the nucleoid, a region of the bacterial chromosome, is not necessary.

This study reveals a new function for SlmA in Vibrio cholerae and highlights the importance of chitobiose utilization for the bacterium's survival and spread in its natural environment.
Researchers have developed a new framework for solving complex mathematical problems that arise when modeling dynamic biological systems. These systems, such as microbial communities, gene regulatory networks, and metabolic pathways, are difficult to analyze due to their nonlinearity and stiffness. The new framework, called nonlinear programming, uses advanced modeling and solution tools to efficiently and accurately estimate the parameters of these systems. This is achieved through a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations and enables the use of computationally efficient solvers.

The framework was tested on a synthetic human gut microbiome community model with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points, and was able to solve the problem in under 3 minutes. In comparison, an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework required over 7 hours. The researchers also demonstrated the scalability of the framework by solving problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in under 15 minutes.

The new framework is flexible, easy to use, and can be applied to a wide range of dynamic models of biological systems. It enables the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques, such as quantifying parameter uncertainty, diagnosing observability issues, and handling outliers. This framework has the potential to enable the construction and analysis of high-fidelity models of complex biological systems, such as whole cells or microbiomes.
Researchers used a high-throughput digital gene expression system called nCounter to study the inflammatory response in mice infected with West Nile virus (WNV). The study aimed to understand how the virus spreads and triggers an immune response in the body. The researchers infected outbred Swiss Webster mice with WNV and analyzed gene expression changes in multiple tissues, including the spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and brain, over a nine-day period. They used a multiplex protein detection system to validate the gene expression results.

The analysis revealed that certain genes, such as Cxcl10 and Il12b, were differentially expressed in all tissues except the kidney. The researchers also found that some genes, like C3ar1, were down-regulated in non-infected tissues, while others, like Il23a, were up-regulated. In infected tissues, genes involved in the immune response, such as Stat1, Tlr2, and cytokines, were significantly up-regulated.

The study demonstrated the utility of the nCounter platform for rapid identification of gene expression changes associated with WNV infection. The researchers were able to differentiate between general inflammatory responses and tissue-specific responses to the virus. The findings suggest that the nCounter system is a reliable tool for studying the immune response to viral infections and understanding the kinetics of viral replication. The study's results provide valuable insights into the dynamic changes in gene expression profiles during WNV infection and highlight the importance of understanding the immune response to viral infections.
In 2014, an outbreak of rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities in Mozambique, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites. The study reviewed cases of human rabies and animal bites from April to July 2014 and conducted a community investigation in the neighborhoods where cases resided. Fourteen cases of human rabies were detected, all of whom had a recent history of dog bite, and only one of the 14 rabid dogs had been immunized. A total of 819 cases of animal bites were registered, with dogs responsible for 97.8% of all bites, but only 27.0% were immunized.

The study found that factors significantly associated with human rabies were age under 15 years, bite by stray dog, deep wound, bite in the head, bite by unimmunized dog, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. The implementation of control measures for rabies was found to be poor in Maputo and Matola cities, where cases of human rabies were strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular implementation of post-exposure measures. The study highlights the need for improved rabies control measures, including vaccination of dogs and post-exposure prophylaxis, to prevent the spread of the disease.
Researchers have identified a new gene, SCN9A, as a potential cause of febrile seizures (FS) in a large Utah family. The gene, which encodes the Nav1.7 sodium channel, was found to have a mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641Y, in 21 affected family members. This mutation was not found in a control group of 586 ethnically matched individuals. To confirm the role of SCN9A in FS, the researchers created a mouse model with the same mutation and found that it made the mice more susceptible to seizures. The mice had reduced thresholds for electrically induced seizures and increased susceptibility to kindling, a process that can lead to seizures.

The researchers also analyzed a collection of 92 unrelated patients with FS and found additional mutations in the SCN9A gene in 5% of the patients. One of these patients later developed Dravet syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy, and was found to have a mutation in the SCN1A gene, which is known to be associated with Dravet syndrome. Further analysis of 109 Dravet syndrome patients revealed that 8% had mutations in the SCN9A gene, often in combination with SCN1A mutations. These findings suggest that SCN9A plays a role in human epilepsies, both as a cause of FS and as a partner with SCN1A mutations. The study provides new insights into the genetic causes of FS and Dravet syndrome, and highlights the importance of SCN9A in central excitability and seizure susceptibility.
Researchers have developed a new framework, called the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth. This framework focuses on the role of molecular signalling, or polarity, in specifying growth orientations, rather than relying on stresses within the tissue. The GPT framework treats tissue as a continuous material where regionally expressed factors interact and propagate, establishing polarity through signals that anchor in specific regions called tissue polarity organisers. Growth rates parallel or perpendicular to the local polarity are then specified through a regulatory network. The resulting growth is influenced by the interaction of specified growth patterns within the constraints of mechanically connected tissue, leading to the emergence of features such as curvature that were not directly specified by the regulatory networks. This framework allows for the generation of complex shapes from simple rules and can account for asymmetries through interactions between polarity fields. The researchers applied the GPT framework to a growing Snapdragon flower and demonstrated its value in understanding morphogenesis. They propose that the combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth rates, a key feature of polarity-based systems, have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of observed biological shapes. The study highlights the importance of specifying orientation independently of stresses in the generation of complex tissue shapes.
Researchers investigated the impact of interference between multiple CD8+ T cell escape mutations in early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. During early HIV infection, multiple CD8+ T cell responses are elicited simultaneously, exerting strong selective pressures on different parts of the virus's genome. This leads to the emergence of mutations that escape recognition and are beneficial to the virus. Some studies have shown that the later these escape mutations emerge, the more slowly they become fixed in the population. This pattern, known as the pattern of escape rate decrease (ERD), can arise through distinct mechanisms, including interference among different escape strains. In large populations with high beneficial mutation rates, interference can significantly impact the escape rates of mutations. The researchers developed a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination to investigate how interference between concurrent escape mutations affects their escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes. They found that interference between several equally selectively advantageous mutations can generate the observed ERD pattern, and that the number of loci and recombination rates substantially affect ERD. The researchers also found that the observed ERD pattern in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with both independent, interference-free mutations and interference effects. Their results suggest that interference effects should be considered when analyzing HIV escape mutations, and that novel estimation methodologies are needed to account for the stochastic nature of competition between mutations.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The model, called a multiscale mechanistic model, takes into account various factors that affect the growth of cancer cells, such as uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. By analyzing data from 13 patients with NSCLC who received different combinations of chemotherapy drugs, the researchers were able to estimate the cell-killing ability of various cisplatin-based doublet regimens. Cisplatin is a common chemotherapy drug used to treat NSCLC, and the researchers found that combining it with other drugs, such as gemcitabine, vinorelbine, or docetaxel, can improve its effectiveness.

The model uses data on tumor size before and after treatment to estimate the cell-killing ability of the chemotherapy. The researchers used a technique called Latin hypercube sampling to account for uncertainties in patient-specific data. They found that the volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis are key factors in accurately estimating the effectiveness of chemotherapy. The model can be used to provide personalized predictions for patients with NSCLC, which could help doctors choose the most effective treatment plan. The researchers believe that their model can be used to estimate the in-vivo cell-killing ability of various chemotherapies, which could lead to more effective treatment options for patients with NSCLC.
Scientists have long known that bacteria in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than their free-floating counterparts. However, the reasons behind this resistance are not well understood. Researchers used a technique called random transposon mutagenesis to identify bacteria that were more resistant to the antibiotic ofloxacin when grown in biofilms. They found that bacteria that were starved of essential nutrients, such as amino acids, were more resistant to ofloxacin than those that were not starved. This resistance was linked to the SOS response, a stress response that bacteria use to cope with damage to their DNA. The researchers also found that the SOS response was necessary for the bacteria to become resistant to ofloxacin when they were starved of both amino acids and a carbon source, such as glucose. However, the resistance was not due to the presence of toxin-antitoxin systems, which are often associated with antibiotic resistance. The researchers also found that the age of the biofilm played a role in the bacteria's resistance to ofloxacin, with older biofilms being more resistant than younger ones. Overall, the study suggests that the SOS response plays a key role in the development of antibiotic resistance in biofilms, particularly when bacteria are starved of essential nutrients.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the invasion of human red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites, the parasites responsible for the deadliest form of malaria. The invasion process is a complex, multi-step process that relies on specific interactions between parasite proteins and host cell receptors. A key step in this process is the timely secretion of proteins from apical organelles called micronemes, which are essential for successful invasion.

The study found that exposure to a low potassium environment, similar to that found in blood plasma, triggers a rise in cAMP levels within the merozoites. This increase in cAMP activates protein kinase A, which in turn regulates the secretion of microneme proteins. The researchers also discovered that cAMP plays a role in regulating calcium levels within the merozoites, which is also essential for microneme secretion.

The study used pharmacological inhibitors to explore the role of a specific adenylyl cyclase enzyme, PfACβ, in regulating cAMP levels. The results suggest that PfACβ is a key player in this process. Additionally, the study found that the parasite has alternative signaling mechanisms to trigger microneme release, which could provide potential targets for inhibiting blood stage parasite growth and preventing malaria.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex process of Plasmodium falciparum invasion of human red blood cells and highlight potential targets for the development of new malaria treatments.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected of the neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Despite its global distribution, estimates of its prevalence are often based on educated guesses due to a lack of reliable data. A recent study reviewed 354 studies from 78 countries to determine the global prevalence of S. stercoralis in general populations and risk groups. The study found high infection rates in several African, Asian, and South American countries, particularly in resource-poor areas where information on the parasite is lacking.

The study also identified associations between S. stercoralis infection and certain risk factors, including HIV-infection and alcoholism. In developed countries, strongyloidiasis remains a concern for immigrants, tourists, and military personnel returning from endemic areas, highlighting the need for systematic screening. The study's findings underscore the importance of not neglecting S. stercoralis, a parasite that affects millions of people worldwide.

The researchers used a Bayesian meta-analysis to estimate country-specific prevalence rates and compared disease odds ratios in different risk groups, taking into account the sensitivity of the diagnostic methods used. The study's results provide valuable insights into the global distribution and risk factors associated with S. stercoralis infection, emphasizing the need for further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings and integration into global helminth control efforts.
Researchers have found a way to measure a key aspect of cellular behavior that affects the body's internal clock, called stochastic noise. Stochastic noise refers to the random fluctuations that occur at the cellular level, influencing how groups of cells synchronize with external cues and generate internal rhythms. To study this phenomenon, scientists typically need to collect and analyze data from individual cells, which can be a challenging and time-consuming process. In this study, the researchers discovered that the rate at which population-level bioluminescence recordings dampen can serve as a reliable indicator of overall stochastic noise. They applied this method to cultured cells and found that higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. The researchers also showed that small molecule modulators can change the damping rate of cultured cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that these changes can be explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. By applying this method to a genome-wide siRNA screen, the researchers found that stochastic noise is altered independently from period, amplitude, and phase. This study highlights the importance of considering the effect of circadian perturbations on stochastic noise, particularly in the development of small-molecule circadian therapeutics. The findings suggest that the unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, as few gene perturbations can simultaneously increase amplitude and lower stochastic noise.
Researchers have been searching for new ways to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and one promising approach is to target the protein FtsZ, which is essential for bacterial cell division. A potential inhibitor of FtsZ, called PC190723, has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against Staphylococcus aureus, but its mechanism of action and effectiveness against other bacterial species are unclear. To better understand how PC190723 interacts with FtsZ, scientists used a statistical method called PocketFEATURE to analyze the 3D structure of the protein's binding pocket. This analysis revealed that the binding pocket varies significantly across different bacterial species and even within the same species depending on the nucleotide-binding state of FtsZ. The researchers found that PC190723 strongly prefers to bind to Staphylococcus FtsZ in the nucleotide-bound state and that polymerization of FtsZ may enhance PC190723 binding. These findings have important implications for the development of FtsZ inhibitors as future therapeutics. The study demonstrates that evaluating the 3D environment of a drug-binding pocket can provide valuable insights into the molecular properties and mechanisms governing drug-protein interactions. The results suggest that PC190723 may be specifically effective for binding to Staphylococcus FtsZ proteins and their close relatives, but may not be effective against other bacterial species. This information can aid in the design of alternative mutants with equivalent structural and chemical features.
Scientists have made a breakthrough in understanding how lentiviruses, such as HIV, integrate their genetic material into the host cell's DNA. The key to this process lies in the interaction between the virus's integrase protein and a host protein called LEDGF (Lens Epithelium-Derived Growth Factor). Researchers have determined the three-dimensional structure of the integrase protein from the HIV-2 virus bound to the LEDGF protein. This structure reveals the specific points of contact between the two proteins, which are crucial for the virus's ability to integrate into the host cell's DNA.

The study found that a specific region of the integrase protein, called the N-terminal domain, plays a key role in binding to LEDGF. Mutations in this region can disrupt the interaction between the two proteins, preventing the virus from integrating into the host cell's DNA. The researchers were able to engineer a mutant of the HIV-1 virus that can only integrate into the host cell's DNA when presented with a modified version of the LEDGF protein.

This discovery provides new insights into the mechanism of lentiviral integration and has implications for the development of gene therapy technologies that target the LEDGF protein. The study also highlights the importance of the N-terminal domain of the integrase protein in facilitating the interaction between the virus and the host cell. Overall, this research advances our understanding of the complex interactions between viruses and host cells, and may lead to new strategies for preventing or treating viral infections.
Researchers investigated how cancer stem cells, which are responsible for initiating and sustaining tumors, evolve and contribute to tumor growth. They developed a computer model to track the behavior of these cells over time, taking into account various factors such as cell migration, cell death, and cell division. The study found that the ability of cancer cells to proliferate, or multiply, is the strongest factor influencing tumor growth. When cancer stem cells have a high proliferation potential, they produce more non-stem cancer cells, which can compete with the stem cells and slow down their division. However, when the proliferation potential decreases, the stem cells can divide more frequently, leading to faster tumor growth. The researchers also found that the sub-population of cancer stem cells within a tumor can be highly heterogeneous, leading to varying population dynamics, from long-term dormancy to aggressive progression. The study suggests that a single tumor biopsy sample may only capture a small proportion of the total number of possible phenotypes, or characteristics, of cancer stem cells. The findings provide new insights into the complex behavior of cancer stem cells and their role in tumor growth and progression.
Researchers used mathematical models to study the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, focusing on the role of spatial heterogeneity within the human population. They found that for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak size distributions and the risk of emergence per introduction. The study suggests that even small connections between communities, such as a village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day, can make the village effectively part of the city in terms of the chances of emergence and outbreak size distribution. Empirical data on commuting patterns show that the vast majority of communities are at least this well interconnected. The researchers conclude that the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. The study's findings have implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections, highlighting the importance of considering the spatial structure of the human host population in understanding the emergence of novel diseases. The researchers also note that other factors, such as human contact patterns and host heterogeneity, may also shape the risk and speed of emergence events.
Scientists have long suspected that wild birds play a significant role in the spread of influenza viruses to humans and livestock. However, predicting the movement of these viruses between different bird populations has been a major challenge. To better understand this process, researchers analyzed genomic data from 287 avian influenza A virus samples collected over a 34-year period from migratory birds in North America. The study used a statistical framework to test hypotheses about viral migration, population structure, and genetic reassortment.

The results showed that while some bird populations, such as those in Delaware Bay, may be hotspots for influenza viruses, they do not contribute significantly to the overall diversity of the virus in other populations. In contrast, birds in Alberta, Canada, are representative of the virus diversity in North America. The study also found that the long-term persistence of the virus is not dependent on specific migratory flyways, but rather on the movement of viruses between populations throughout the continent.

The researchers used a large-scale analysis of surveillance data to identify 20 discrete regions in North America where influenza viruses have been collected from wild birds. They found that the majority of genetic diversity of the North American influenza gene pool is captured in Alberta, which is a convergence point for all four migratory flyways. The study suggests that the social behavior of breeding birds in this region plays a key role in the persistence of the virus population. Overall, the findings provide valuable insights for developing predictive models to prepare for potential pandemics and protect livestock.
Researchers have developed a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S139/1, that targets a specific site on the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza A viruses. This antibody shows broad cross-reactivity, meaning it can neutralize multiple subtypes of the virus, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13. In laboratory tests, MAb S139/1 was able to block the attachment of the virus to host cells, preventing infection. The antibody also inhibited hemagglutination, a process by which the virus binds to red blood cells. This suggests that MAb S139/1 works by blocking the virus's ability to attach to host cells, rather than just recognizing a specific subtype of the virus. The researchers found that the antibody was effective against various strains of the virus, including H1, H2, H3, and H13 subtypes. Mutant viruses that were resistant to MAb S139/1 were identified, and analysis of their HA genes revealed specific amino acid substitutions that allowed them to evade the antibody's neutralizing effects. A molecular modeling study showed that these amino acids are located on the surface of the HA protein, forming a novel epitope that is recognized by MAb S139/1. The researchers also demonstrated that passive immunization with MAb S139/1 provided heterosubtypic protection against influenza A virus infection in mice. These findings suggest that MAb S139/1 has the potential to be used as a therapeutic agent against influenza A virus infections, and highlight the importance of cross-reactive antibodies in heterosubtypic immunity.
Researchers conducted a three-year study to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in controlling chronic Strongyloides stercoralis infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study involved 259 adults living in a remote community in northern Australia. Participants were tested for S. stercoralis infection using a commercial ELISA kit, and those with positive results were treated with ivermectin. Follow-up tests were conducted six months and three years after treatment.

The results showed that ivermectin treatment was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in the study group. The initial prevalence of infection was 35.3%, which decreased to 5.8% three years after treatment. The study also suggested that using a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was valid in this setting. However, a small group of participants continued to test positive for the infection despite repeated treatment.

The study found that the prevalence of S. stercoralis infection in the cohort decreased to 1.4% three years after treatment, indicating the success of this treatment strategy. The researchers concluded that control of chronic S. stercoralis infection in an adult Aboriginal population may be achieved through a process of case finding and treatment, using current best practice guidelines for treatment. This study provides evidence that pharmacological treatment alone may be sufficient to control S. stercoralis infection in this population.
Researchers have investigated how different strains of prions, misfolded proteins that cause diseases such as mad cow disease, interact with each other. Prion strains are thought to be encoded by specific conformations of the prion protein, and when two strains infect the same animal, they can interfere with each other's ability to cause disease. However, it was unknown whether two long-incubation period strains, which take a long time to cause disease, could interfere with each other. In this study, researchers co-infected animals with combinations of long-incubation period strains and found that they did not interfere with each other. To confirm this result, they used a laboratory technique called protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference, which showed that both strains were amplifying independently. This suggests that the lack of interference is not due to a failure to target the same cells, but is an inherent property of the strains involved. The researchers also found that long-incubation period strains contain relatively high levels of a protein called PrPC, which is necessary for prion formation. This abundance of PrPC may allow long-incubation period strains to amplify independently, even in the presence of other strains. These findings change our understanding of how prion strains interact with each other and have implications for the transmission of prion diseases between species and the emergence of new prion strains.
Researchers have proposed a new comprehensive ensemble model to compare the role of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation. Allosteric regulation is a process where the binding of a molecule to one site on a protein affects the activity of another site. Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) are prevalent in allosteric regulation, but it was previously thought that their intrinsic disorder was favorable for maximizing the allosteric coupling. The new model, which considers both order-disorder and order-order transitions, reveals that the MWC pathway (order-order transition) has a higher probability than the EAM pathway (disorder-order transition) in allostery. This suggests that IDPs/IDRs may not be as advantageous in allosteric regulation as previously thought. The model also provides an analytic formula for the maximal allosteric coupling response, which shows that too stable or too unstable states are unfavorable for allostery. This finding has implications for the rational design of allosteric drugs. The study highlights the complexity of the role of IDPs/IDRs in allosteric regulation and suggests that their prevalence may be due to factors beyond their capacity to endow allostery. Further research is needed to fully understand the importance of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-Catenin in prostate development and cancer. β-Catenin is a protein essential for many developmental processes and has been linked to tumorigenesis in various tissues, including prostate cancer. However, its specific function in prostate cancer is unclear. The study used in vivo genetic studies in mice to explore the role of β-Catenin in normal and neoplastic prostate development. The results showed that β-Catenin is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching, but is dispensable in the normal adult organ. During development, β-Catenin regulates the number of progenitor cells in the epithelial buds and controls a network of genes, including c-Myc and Nkx3.1. Deletion of β-Catenin in a model of castration-resistant prostate cancer showed that it is not necessary for disease progression in this setting. However, overexpression of β-Catenin, achieved through protein stabilization, promoted the formation of squamous epithelia during prostate development, even in the absence of androgens. When combined with Pten loss, β-Catenin overexpression drove the progression to invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplasia. These findings demonstrate that β-Catenin is essential for prostate development and that high levels of this protein can drive squamous fate differentiation. Additionally, they show that β-Catenin overexpression can promote invasive prostate cancer in a clinically relevant model of the disease.
Researchers conducted a study to understand how to obtain informed consent from participants in a low-income setting, specifically in southern Ethiopia, where a genetic study on podoconiosis (non-filarial elephantiasis) was being conducted. They used a qualitative approach, involving focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews with patients, non-patients, fieldworkers, researchers, and community leaders. The study found that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and the presentation of information had a significant impact on comprehension of the research. Locally trusted individuals, such as fieldworkers, were seen as the best way to approach podoconiosis patients, and community sensitization before individual consent was considered optimal. The researchers also identified potential barriers to obtaining genuine informed consent, including poverty, lack of alternative treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the local non-governmental organization (NGO) working on podoconiosis prevention and treatment. The study suggests that researchers should evaluate the effectiveness of consent processes on a study-by-study basis to provide appropriate information in a comprehensible manner and support voluntary decision-making. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the social and cultural context of the community and potential research participants before seeking informed consent.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the dynamics of T cell proliferation in the immune system. T cells are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in fighting infections and diseases. The model uses data from single-cell experiments to simulate the behavior of T cells as they differentiate and proliferate in the thymus and spleen. The study found that T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous, meaning it varies greatly from cell to cell, and is influenced by genetic background, age, and cell differentiation stage.

The researchers used a technique called pulse-chase-pulse experiments to track the proliferation of T cells in mice. They found that T cells from different genetic backgrounds, such as FVB and C57BL/6 mice, have different rates of proliferation. FVB mice had significantly lower rates of T cell proliferation than C57BL/6 mice in both the thymus and spleen. The study also found that T cell proliferation changes with age, with older mice having slower rates of proliferation.

The model developed by the researchers allows for the estimation of proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in sub-populations of T cells. This information can be used to understand how the immune system changes with age and how genetic background affects T cell function. The study provides new insights into the complex dynamics of T cell proliferation and has implications for our understanding of immune function and disease.
Researchers have created the first pathological mutation in a mitochondrial tRNA gene in mouse cells, mimicking a disease-causing mutation found in humans. The mutation, an m. 3739G>A transition in the mt-Ti gene, causes abnormal folding of the tRNAIle, preventing it from being charged with isoleucine. This leads to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondria, triggering a compensatory response to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis. This response partially compensates for the deficiency, allowing the cells to survive despite the mutation. The researchers propose that this compensatory mechanism can explain the variable penetrance of the disease in humans, where some individuals with the mutation do not develop symptoms. The study also suggests that this mechanism can facilitate the evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs, allowing two deleterious alleles to become fixed in a population without requiring simultaneous mutation. This is in contrast to protein-coding genes, where mutations often have more severe consequences. The findings have implications for understanding the pathology and evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs, and highlight the unique characteristics of tRNA mutations compared to protein-coding gene mutations.
Researchers investigated how the active X chromosome is regulated in human triploid cells, which have three sets of chromosomes instead of the usual two. They used expression arrays to compare the expression of X-linked and autosomal genes in triploid cells with one or two active X chromosomes. The results showed that the average expression ratio of X-linked genes to autosomal genes was lower in triploid cells with one active X and higher in triploid cells with two active X's compared to normal diploid cells. This suggests that X-linked gene expression is adjusted in response to the number of active X chromosomes.

In triploid cells with two active X's, the expression of most X-linked genes was doubled, consistent with previous findings. However, in triploid cells with one active X, X-linked gene expression was further increased, indicating an epigenetic adjustment in response to the X/autosome ratio. The researchers found that a small subset of genes had expression levels proportional to the number of autosomal sets, suggesting that these genes may be regulated in a dosage-sensitive manner.

The study found no evidence of a global change in absolute expression level per autosomal gene copy in triploid versus diploid cells, indicating that gene expression is strictly proportional to the number of autosomal sets. The results suggest that adjustments in gene expression in triploid cultures mostly affect X-linked genes, and that X-linked gene expression is up-regulated approximately two-fold in triploid cultures with two active X chromosomes. However, in triploid cultures with a single active X, X expression is adjusted further upward, but not tripled.
Researchers have re-examined the dN/dS ratio, a measure used to quantify evolutionary pressures on proteins. The dN/dS ratio compares the rate of substitutions at non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) sites in a protein. This measure was originally developed for comparing distantly related sequences, but it is often applied to samples from a single population. The study found that in a single population, the dN/dS ratio is relatively insensitive to the strength of selection. This means that the ratio does not accurately reflect the level of selection acting on a protein. The study also found that the relationship between selection and dN/dS is not straightforward in a single population, making it difficult to infer selection pressures from dN/dS measurements. In contrast, the relationship between selection and dN/dS is more predictable when comparing divergent lineages. The study's findings have significant implications for the interpretation of dN/dS measurements in population genetics. They suggest that standard tests for selection based on dN/dS may not be reliable when applied to samples from a single population. The study's results also highlight the limitations of using dN/dS to detect positive selection in conspecific samples.
Scientists have long sought to understand how natural selection shapes genetic variation across genomes. A key question is how natural selection affects neutral genetic diversity, which is the variation within a species, versus neutral sequence divergence, which is the variation between species. Previous studies have shown that neutral genetic diversity is reduced at sites linked to those under direct selection, but the effect of linked selection on neutral sequence divergence remains unclear. This study aimed to address this issue by examining whether natural selection can affect divergence between closely and distantly related species. The researchers found that neutral divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with human recombination rate. Similarly, neutral divergence between distantly related species, such as humans and rodents, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with estimates of background selection from primates. These patterns persisted even after accounting for potential confounding factors. The study suggests that natural selection can indirectly affect linked neutral divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. This finding has implications for understanding the evolution of genomes and interpreting patterns of genetic variation.
Researchers have discovered that the CK2 kinase plays a crucial role in regulating the Drosophila circadian clock. Specifically, CK2 stabilizes the CLOCK (CLK) protein and reduces its activity. CLK is a key component of the circadian oscillator, responsible for activating the expression of genes involved in the clock's negative feedback loop. The study found that downregulating the activity of the CK2 kinase leads to CLK degradation, even in the absence of other clock proteins. This suggests that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. The researchers also found that CK2's regulatory β subunit is not necessary for regulating CLK stability. In contrast, the CK1 kinase promotes CLK degradation. The study's findings indicate that the stability and activity of CLK result from the counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2. This research provides new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying the Drosophila circadian clock and highlights the importance of CK2 in regulating CLK function. The study's results also suggest that CK2 may play a key role in setting the proper phase of CLK transcriptional activity in the circadian cycle.
Researchers investigated the role of cruzipain, a cysteine peptidase, in the interaction between the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi and its insect host, Rhodnius prolixus. T. cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas' disease, a significant public health concern in the Americas. The study aimed to determine whether cruzipain contributes to the parasite's adhesion to the insect's midgut.

The researchers treated T. cruzi epimastigotes with anti-cruzipain antibodies or a panel of cysteine peptidase inhibitors and found that all treatments, except one, significantly reduced parasite adhesion to the insect midgut. Cystatin, a cysteine peptidase inhibitor, showed a dose-dependent reduction in adhesion. The study also compared the adhesion rates of different T. cruzi isolates and found that those with naturally low levels of active cruzipain adhered less to the insect gut.

Transgenic epimastigotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzipain inhibitor, chagasin, had reduced levels of active cruzipain and adhered to the insect gut 73% less than wild-type parasites. The addition of exogenous cruzipain partially restored the adhesion of these parasites. In vivo colonization experiments showed that the chagasin-overexpressing parasites had low levels of colonization in the insect, but parasites isolated after passage in the insect had increased expression of surface cruzipain. These findings suggest that cruzipain plays a role in the interaction between T. cruzi and its insect host.
Researchers have identified 20 genes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that can suppress mutations in the dynein heavy chain, a protein essential for cell division. Dynein is a microtubule-dependent motor protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including cell division, vesicle transport, and organelle positioning. By screening a genome-wide RNA interference library, the researchers found that reducing the function of these 20 genes can suppress the effects of dynein heavy chain mutations, but not mutations in other genes. Twelve of these suppressor genes do not cause sterility or lethality when their function is reduced in wild-type worms.

The researchers also found that two of the suppressor proteins, dynein light chains, localize to subcellular sites that overlap with those of the dynein heavy chain. Additionally, knocking down four putative dynein accessory chains can suppress the conditional heavy chain mutants, suggesting that some accessory chains negatively regulate heavy chain function. Furthermore, the researchers identified 29 additional genes that, when reduced in function, can suppress mutations not only in dynein but also in genes required for unrelated essential processes. These findings suggest that conserved but nonessential genes contribute to dynein function during the essential process of mitosis. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms that regulate and mediate the many different requirements for cytoplasmic dynein during mitosis.
In the ciliate Paramecium tetraurelia, programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) occur during somatic differentiation, where DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) drive the precise elimination of 45,000 germline sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). A domesticated transposase, PiggyMac, is essential for DNA cleavage, and DSB repair at excision sites involves the Ligase IV, a component of the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway. To understand how DNA cleavage and DSB repair are coordinated during PGR, researchers focused on Ku, the earliest actor of NHEJ-mediated repair. Two Ku70 and three Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the P. tetraurelia genome, with Ku70a and Ku80c produced during sexual processes and localizing specifically in the developing new somatic nucleus. RNA interference showed that the development-specific Ku70/Ku80c heterodimer is essential for the recovery of a functional somatic nucleus. PiggyMac-dependent DNA cleavage is abolished at IES boundaries in cells depleted for Ku80c, resulting in IES retention in the somatic genome. The Ku70a/Ku80c heterodimer co-purifies with PiggyMac in a heterologous system, indicating that Ku has been integrated in the Paramecium DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair during PGR.
Researchers studied the early stages of prion disease in mice to understand how it affects the brain. Prion diseases, such as mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have a long incubation period before symptoms appear. During this time, the prion particles multiply in the brain, causing damage to neurons. However, the exact mechanisms of this damage are not well understood.

The study used a technique called laser capture microdissection to isolate specific neurons in the hippocampus, a region of the brain affected by prion disease. The researchers analyzed the expression of genes in these neurons at different stages of the disease. They found that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic and changes over time.

The study identified a cluster of genes that are altered during the early stages of the disease. This cluster includes genes involved in synaptic function, particularly the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, which plays a crucial role in learning and memory. The researchers also found that certain microRNAs, which are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, are deregulated during the disease.

The study suggests that prion replication triggers a programmed response in neurons, which initially promotes cell survival and neurite remodeling. However, this response is terminated before the onset of clinical symptoms, indicating a critical juncture in the disease. The researchers propose that manipulating these early neuroprotective pathways may provide a potential treatment for prion disease.
Researchers have developed a computer model, called a Petri net model, to study the formation and function of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in response to infection with the parasite Leishmania donovani. This parasite causes a disease called visceral leishmaniasis, which affects the liver and can be fatal if left untreated. The model simulated the development of granulomas in the liver of mice infected with the parasite and accurately predicted the changes in the composition of immune cells within the granulomas over time. By using this model, the researchers were able to identify a previously unknown level of diversity in the development of anti-parasite activity within granulomas. They also found that a protein called IL-10, produced by a type of immune cell called a Kupffer cell, plays a key role in regulating the immune response within the granuloma. The model suggests that IL-10 helps to prevent excessive inflammation and promotes the elimination of the parasite. The researchers validated their model by comparing its predictions with data from experiments in mice and found that it accurately recapitulated the progression of the disease. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of granuloma formation and function, which could lead to the development of new treatments for visceral leishmaniasis.
Researchers have explored the idea that the transcriptional regulatory machinery of a gene can be viewed as a computational device, with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression level as the output. By analyzing a simple chemical kinetic model of transcriptional regulation, they found that different parameterizations can approximate all four standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as various equality and inequality operations. This is in contrast to previous studies that emphasized logical or digital notions of computation in biological networks.

The researchers demonstrated that networks of these "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in a time-varying signal. They designed and simulated an eight-gene network that tracks the mean and standard deviation of a signal and detects times at which the signal is statistically significantly elevated. They also considered a model of a gene regulated by a single type of transcription factor but having multiple binding sites on the promoter.

The study suggests that transcriptional regulatory networks can perform arithmetic computations, and that other functions, such as exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions, could be computed by combinations of the arithmetic operations. However, this would be energetically wasteful and would require many genes. A more efficient approach is to approximate directly by using more complicated regulatory machinery. The researchers' findings have implications for the interpretation of naturally occurring networks and suggest new possibilities for the design of synthetic networks.
A recent outbreak of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in the Northeast region of Brazil has been found to be caused by multiple genotypes of the virus, according to a new study. Researchers used a technique called Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to directly sequence the CHIKV genomes from clinical samples and found that both the Asian/Caribbean and African ECSA genotypes are circulating in the region. This is the first time that simultaneous infection by two different CHIKV genotypes has been detected in the same region. The study found evidence of coinfection in at least six clinical samples, suggesting that this may be more common than previously thought in highly endemic areas. The researchers used an in-house developed NGS protocol that can detect multiple known CHIKV genotypes directly from clinical samples, allowing for a more accurate understanding of the virus's epidemiology. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering the possibility of coinfection by different genotypes in the human population when studying CHIKV epidemiology. CHIKV has caused significant health and economic burdens worldwide, and its rapid spread in Brazil in 2014 highlights the need for continued research into the virus's behavior and evolution.
The bacterial protein H-NS plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to external stimuli, such as changes in osmolarity and temperature. Research has shown that H-NS targets both core genome and horizontally acquired (HGT) genes, silencing their expression. However, a new study reveals that H-NS discriminates between these two types of genes and modulates them differently. The study found that plasmid-encoded H-NS proteins have evolved to selectively silence HGT genes, while chromosomally-encoded H-NS targets both HGT and core genomic DNA, but uses a helper protein called Hha to specifically silence HGT genes. In contrast, core genes are modulated by H-NS homoligomers. The presence of Hha-like proteins is restricted to the Enterobacteriaceae family, and conjugative plasmids encoding H-NS variants have only been isolated from members of this family. This unique feature of the H-NS system in enteric bacteria may help maintain horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent state, giving these bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization. The study also found that H-NS interacts with members of the Hha/YmoA family to specifically silence HGT genes, and that other genes in several enteric bacteria are modulated by an H-NS/Hha complex rather than by H-NS alone.
Researchers studied the gene expression of Leishmania parasites, which cause a range of diseases in humans, to understand how they adapt to different hosts. They compared the gene expression of three Leishmania species, L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis, and found that most genes are conserved across the species. However, a small number of genes are differentially distributed between the species. The researchers used microarrays to analyze the expression of these genes in the disease-causing stage of the parasite, called amastigotes, and found that only a few genes are regulated at the RNA level. This suggests that Leishmania parasites are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little dynamic modulation of gene expression. The study also investigated how host immune competence affects parasite gene expression by comparing RNA expression profiles in L. major amastigotes from wild-type and immunologically compromised mice. The results showed that parasite dissemination is enhanced in immunocompromised mice, but parasite RNA expression profiles remain unchanged. This supports the hypothesis that Leishmania amastigotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival. The study's findings suggest that species-specific parasite factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity may be limited to the products of a small number of differentially distributed genes or the differential regulation of conserved genes, which are subject to translational and/or post-translational controls.
Researchers have developed a new diagnostic tool, called LAMPhimerus, to detect the Amphimerus sp. parasite in human stool samples. This parasite causes a disease called amphimeriasis, which is prevalent in the tropical Pacific region of Ecuador. Current methods for diagnosing amphimeriasis involve examining stool samples for parasite eggs, but these methods are not sensitive and can be confused with other types of parasites. The new LAMPhimerus assay uses a technique called loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) to detect the parasite's DNA. The researchers tested the assay on 44 human stool samples from areas where the parasite is common and found that it was 76.67% sensitive and 80.77% specific. This means that the assay can accurately detect the parasite in about 3 out of 4 infected individuals. The LAMPhimerus assay is a significant improvement over current methods and has the potential to be adapted for use in field diagnosis and disease surveillance in areas where amphimeriasis is common. The assay can detect as little as 1 picogram of the parasite's DNA, making it a highly sensitive tool. The researchers plan to conduct further studies to validate the assay and assess its applicability in real-world settings.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called Ykt6 in the process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, a critical step in cellular recycling. Autophagosomes, which contain damaged or dysfunctional cellular components, need to fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, where the contents are broken down and recycled. The study found that Ykt6, a type of SNARE protein, is essential for this process in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. Without Ykt6, autophagosomes accumulate and are unable to fuse with lysosomes, leading to cellular dysfunction.

Ykt6 forms a complex with other SNARE proteins, including Syx17 and Snap29, and localizes to lysosomes and autolysosomes. However, it can be outcompeted by another SNARE protein, Vamp7, which is also required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion. The study found that overexpressing Vamp7 can rescue the fusion defect caused by the loss of Ykt6, suggesting that Vamp7 is directly involved in membrane fusion. Ykt6, on the other hand, acts as a regulatory SNARE, stabilizing the SNARE complex until Vamp7 can enter the fusion site.

The researchers also found that a point mutant form of Ykt6, which cannot form a stable SNARE complex, retains normal autophagic activity and restores full viability in mutant animals. This suggests that Ykt6's role in autophagosome-lysosome fusion is not solely dependent on its ability to form a SNARE complex. The study provides new insights into the complex process of autophagosome-lysosome fusion and highlights the importance of Ykt6 in this process.
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a crucial role in the host's innate immune defense against bacterial infections. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) is a common inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa, but can cause opportunistic infections in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. To evade the bactericidal effects of AMPs, NTHI uses the Sap ABC transporter, which imports AMPs into the bacterial cytoplasm, where they are degraded. This process is mediated by the periplasmic binding protein SapA, which binds to AMPs and delivers them to the inner membrane complex for transport into the cytoplasm.

Research has shown that AMPs are amphipathic, cationic molecules that target bacterial membranes, disrupt transmembrane potential, and trigger cytoplasmic leakage, leading to bacterial cell death. NTHI must acquire nutrients and defend against host innate immune defense strategies, including increased production of AMPs, to transition from a commensal to a pathogen. The expression of AMPs can impact the ability of bacteria to colonize a host, and previous studies have demonstrated that β-defensin expression controls NTHI bacterial colonization of the nasopharyngeal mucosal surface.

This study provides the first direct evidence that SapA contributes to bacterial virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo. The researchers found that AMPs localize to the bacterial cytoplasm of the parental NTHI strain and are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptidase activity, but accumulate in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex. These findings support a novel mechanism of Sap-mediated import of AMPs, which reduces periplasmic and inner membrane accumulation of these host defense peptides.
Researchers investigated how the protein MarA, a key regulator of antibiotic resistance in E. coli, controls its downstream targets. They found that MarA's short half-life, due to active degradation by the Lon protease, affects its ability to coordinate downstream genes. By modifying MarA's half-life using CRISPRi or engineering it to be more stable, the researchers observed changes in the rate and maximum coordination of downstream genes. The study suggests that active degradation allows for a more responsive and agile signaling network, enabling E. coli to rapidly generate phenotypic diversity in response to antibiotic challenges. However, this comes at the cost of perfect information fidelity and instantaneous coordination. The researchers propose that the utility of active degradation lies in its ability to allow a few remaining cells to regenerate diversity following antibiotic exposure. The study highlights the importance of considering the role of active degradation in shaping the behavior of regulatory proteins like MarA, which controls over 60 downstream targets involved in various antibiotic resistance roles. The findings have implications for understanding how bacteria adapt to changing environments and develop resistance to antibiotics.
Researchers investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MKP-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major, a parasite that causes skin lesions. In a previous study, they found that MKP-2 deficient mice were more susceptible to another parasite, Leishmania mexicana. However, in this study, they infected MKP-2 deficient mice with Leishmania major and found that they were able to control the infection just like wild-type mice. The researchers measured the size of the lesions and the number of parasites in the mice and found no significant difference between the two groups. They also analyzed the immune response of the mice and found that the MKP-2 deficient mice had a reduced TH1 response, which is a type of immune response that helps to fight off infections. However, they also found that the TH2 response, which is another type of immune response, was equally suppressed in the MKP-2 deficient mice. As a result, the balance between the TH1 and TH2 responses was not altered in the MKP-2 deficient mice. The researchers also found that the macrophages, a type of immune cell, from the MKP-2 deficient mice were equally effective at killing the parasites as the macrophages from the wild-type mice. Overall, the study suggests that the absence of MKP-2 does not make mice more susceptible to Leishmania major infection, and that the immune response to this parasite is more complex than previously thought.
Researchers have studied the development of the ductal network in the pancreas, a branched organ that plays a crucial role in digestion. Unlike other glands, the pancreas does not have a stereotypical branching pattern, and its ductal network undergoes significant changes as it matures. By analyzing the network properties at different stages of development, the researchers found that the pancreas exhibits stereotypical traits at each stage, and its network properties change systematically as it matures.

The study used in silico modeling to deconstruct the formation and maturation of the ductal network into a few simple rules. The researchers found that the early stage of the network can be explained by the formation of new microlumens through noisy and redundant duct connections. The later transition to a treelike structure is attributed to the pruning of the network based on the flow of fluid into the duodenum.

The study also found that the pancreatic network has stereotypical properties at different developmental stages, from embryonic day 12.5 to 18.5. The researchers used standard network measures to quantify the remodeling of the ductal network and identified a set of simple rules that govern its development. These rules are likely to be conserved in other glands that secrete fluid, such as the salivary gland. The study's findings provide new insights into the development of the pancreas and may have implications for understanding the development of other glands.
Researchers have mapped the structural and dynamical features of kinesin motor domains, which drive intracellular transport by converting ATP energy into movement along microtubules. By analyzing 114 experimental structures and conducting molecular dynamics simulations, the study identified three distinct conformational clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5 inhibitor-bound. These groups differ in the orientation of key functional elements, such as the microtubule-binding α4–α5 subdomain and loop8 subdomain. However, group membership does not correlate with the nature of the bound nucleotide, but rather with the orientation of the neck-linker.

Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all three nucleotide states (ATP, ADP, and nucleotide-free) can sample the major crystallographically observed conformations. The simulations also showed that the neck-linker, loop8, and α4–α5 subdomain display correlated motions in ATP-bound simulations, but not in ADP-bound simulations. This suggests a network of dynamic communication between the active site, microtubule-binding interface, and neck-linker via loop7 and loop13. Mutations in loop13 were found to reduce the flexibility of these regions and disrupt their couplings.

The study's results support a model where neck-linker docking leads to a tighter coupling of the microtubule and nucleotide binding regions. The simulations also highlight sites critical for large-scale conformational changes and the allosteric coupling between distal functional sites. Overall, the study provides new insights into the structural and dynamical features of kinesin motor domains and their role in intracellular transport.
Researchers have developed a new method to accurately interpret bioluminescent data from the Lux system, a widely used gene expression reporter. The Lux system, originally developed for bacterial cells, has been adapted for eukaryotic cells and can measure gene expression in real-time without harming the cells. However, interpreting bioluminescent data has been challenging due to nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. A new mathematical model has been created to relate gene expression to light output, taking into account the actions of LuxAB, LuxEC, and Fre enzymes, as well as protein synthesis and turnover. The model was calibrated with new experimental data from Photorhabdus luminescens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for LuxEC. The model shows that bioluminescent profiles can be very different from changes in gene expression, with transient peaks of light output. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian inference scheme, researchers can reverse-engineer promoter activity from bioluminescence data. This approach can help users of Lux technology to better understand gene expression and make more accurate interpretations of bioluminescent data. The method can be applied to various experiments using Lux reporter assays, including those studying antimicrobial resistance genes.
Researchers have made a significant discovery in the fight against hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), a common illness in children caused by enteroviruses such as coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) and enterovirus 71 (EV71). A compound called GPP3 has been found to inhibit the replication of these viruses by binding to their capsid, a protein shell that surrounds the viral genome. To better understand how GPP3 works, scientists have determined the crystal structure of CVA16 in complex with GPP3. This structure reveals the key residues involved in the interaction between GPP3 and the virus.

Using this information, researchers used computer simulations to test the effectiveness of two new compounds, NLD and ALD, against a range of enteroviruses. The results showed that these compounds are potent inhibitors of the viruses and have broad-spectrum antiviral activity. A meta-analysis of the structural features of these compounds revealed that certain characteristics are associated with their ability to interact effectively with the virus and confer broad-spectrum activity.

The researchers also tested the antiviral activity of GPP3, NLD, and ALD against a panel of enteroviruses and found that all three compounds showed good activity against polioviruses. The study suggests that targeting the hydrophobic pocket below the canyon in the VP1 protein of the virus could be a promising approach for developing new antiviral therapies. Overall, this research provides valuable insights into the structure and function of enteroviruses and identifies potential targets for the development of new treatments for HFMD and other enterovirus infections.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the Necrotic serpin plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections. When the fly is infected, a proteolytic cascade is activated, which signals through the Toll receptor and leads to the production of antibiotic peptides. The Necrotic serpin is synthesized in the fat-body and exported to the haemolymph, but its site of degradation has been unclear. Researchers used a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis and found that Necrotic is removed from the haemolymph in two groups of giant cells: the garland and pericardial athrocytes. The serpin is processed through multi-vesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, where it co-localizes with the ubiquitin-binding protein HRS. The researchers also identified the Lipophorin Receptor-1 (LpR1) as an enhancer of the immune response and found that uptake of Necrotic from the haemolymph is blocked by a chromosomal deletion of LpR1. In the absence of infection, the Toll-mediated immune response is constitutively activated in Nec null mutants, suggesting that Nec continually restrains this immune response. The study reveals the cells and receptor molecule responsible for the uptake and degradation of the Necrotic serpin in Drosophila melanogaster, shedding light on the regulation of proteolytic cascades in the fly's immune response.
Scientists have long known that Nodal and BMP signals play a crucial role in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry in vertebrates. In sea urchins, Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side. However, the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during LR axis establishment was unclear. Researchers have now revealed that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in the small micromeres. They found that BMP signaling is required for activating the expression of left-sided genes and the formation of left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. The study suggests that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins. This opposing role of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry is conserved in deuterostomes. The researchers also found that BMP signaling is required for proper LR patterning and the expression of left-sided genes in the sea urchin embryo. Additionally, they discovered that BMP signaling is required for right-sided Nodal expression in the sea urchin embryo. This positive role of BMP signaling on Nodal gene expression has also been observed in vertebrates. The study provides new insights into the molecular basis of LR asymmetry in the sea urchin embryo.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle, with infected G0/G1 cells supporting viral immediate early (IE) gene expression and proceeding to the G1/S boundary where they arrest. In contrast, S/G2 cells can be infected but effectively block IE gene expression, which is not relieved until host cells have divided and reentered G1. This block to IE gene expression is also present during latent infection and must be overcome for reactivation to occur.

Research has shown that the block to IE gene expression during S and G2 phases can be overcome by genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of cellular DNA replication, indicating the involvement of checkpoint-dependent signaling pathways. Checkpoint-dependent rescue of IE expression requires p53 and is mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 is also required downstream of p53, suggesting a pivotal role for CDKs in controlling IE gene repression in S/G2.

Treatment of S/G2 cells with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine alleviates IE repression independently of p53, and CDK inhibition also overcomes the block to IE expression during quiescent infection of NTera2 cells. This suggests that a timely block to CDK activity secures phase specificity of the cell cycle-dependent HCMV IE gene expression program and plays a role in preventing the establishment of a latent-like state.
Researchers have identified a key factor in the immune system's ability to control HIV-1 in a small group of people known as elite controllers. These individuals are able to restrict the replication of the virus without the need for antiretroviral therapy. The study found that dendritic cells, a type of immune cell, play a crucial role in this process. When exposed to HIV-1, dendritic cells from elite controllers rapidly produce type I interferons and upregulate genes that help fight the virus. This cell-intrinsic immune response is associated with a reduced ability of the virus to replicate and an increased ability to stimulate the production of HIV-1-specific T cells. The researchers found that this response is mediated by the cytosolic DNA sensor cGAS and is inhibited by blocking viral reverse transcription or silencing cGAS. The study suggests that this innate immune response in dendritic cells is essential for the induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells, which are critical for controlling the virus. The findings have implications for the development of immunological approaches for HIV-1 treatment and prevention, particularly for vaccine candidates that rely on dendritic cells to induce HIV-1-specific immune responses. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the immune control of HIV-1 in elite controllers and highlights the importance of cell-intrinsic immune recognition in the fight against the virus.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes that contribute to obesity by screening Drosophila larvae for increased fat storage. The method, based on buoyancy, allows for the identification of 66 genes that, when mutated, lead to higher fat levels in the larvae. One of these genes, Sir2, a member of the sirtuin family, was found to play a key role in regulating fat storage. Sirtuins are known to regulate the storage and metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids, but their function in energy homeostasis has been difficult to define in mammals due to their diverse roles in different tissues.

In Drosophila, Sir2 was found to function in the fat body, a tissue responsible for fat storage, in a cell-autonomous manner. This means that Sir2 acts within individual cells of the fat body to regulate fat storage. The researchers also found that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells of the fat body, and that changes in the expression of metabolic enzymes in Sir2 mutants point to a shift away from catabolism.

Interestingly, Sir2 mutant larvae were found to survive better than wild-type larvae under conditions of amino-acid starvation as long as sugars were provided. This suggests that Sir2 mediates a pathway that activates a catabolic response to amino-acid starvation, regardless of the sugar content of the diet. The study provides new insights into the role of Sir2 in regulating fat storage and energy homeostasis, and highlights the potential of Drosophila as a model organism for studying obesity and metabolic disorders.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes, closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, to understand the evolution of asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric cell division is crucial for generating cellular diversity, and the mitotic spindle plays a key role in determining the size and fate of daughter cells. The team recorded and analyzed the first embryonic division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabditis and 15 non-Caenorhabditis species. They found that while all species underwent an asymmetric cell division, there was significant variation in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. These parameters changed frequently during evolution, with no apparent directionality in the species phylogeny, except for spindle transverse oscillations, which were an evolutionary innovation at the base of the Caenorhabditis genus. Importantly, spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently, contrasting with expectations based on C. elegans studies. The findings demonstrate that the essential process of asymmetric cell division has been conserved over nematode evolution, but the underlying spindle movement parameters can combine in various ways. This suggests that asymmetric cell division is subject to system drift, like other developmental processes.
Researchers studied how two closely related bacteria, Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli, respond to acid stress. They found that both bacteria have the same protein, OmpR, but it is regulated differently in each species. In Salmonella Typhimurium, acid stress triggers the production of OmpR, which then binds to specific genes to help the bacteria survive. In contrast, E. coli does not produce more OmpR in response to acid stress.

The researchers discovered that the difference in OmpR regulation is due to variations in the promoter region of the ompR gene, which is responsible for producing the OmpR protein. They found that introducing the promoter region from Salmonella Typhimurium into E. coli made it respond to acid stress like Salmonella Typhimurium. The OmpR regulon, or the set of genes regulated by OmpR, is also different between the two species. Salmonella Typhimurium's OmpR regulon includes many genes that are not found in E. coli, including some that are involved in virulence.

The researchers also found that OmpR binds to its target genes more easily when the DNA is relaxed, which occurs in response to acid stress in Salmonella Typhimurium. This allows OmpR to regulate more genes in response to acid stress. The study suggests that the ability of OmpR to bind to many different genes is due to its ability to recognize relaxed DNA, rather than a specific sequence of nucleotides.
Researchers have identified a new protein, called NUE, secreted by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. This protein contains a SET domain, which is typically associated with histone methyltransferase activity. Studies showed that NUE is translocated to the host cell nucleus and associates with chromatin during infection. In vitro experiments confirmed that NUE is a histone methyltransferase that targets histones H2B, H3, and H4, as well as itself through a process called automethylation. The researchers found that automethylation enhances NUE's enzymatic activity, suggesting that it may increase the protein's affinity for its target substrates. This is the first time a bacterial effector protein has been shown to directly target mammalian histones. The study also demonstrated that NUE has a preference for mammalian histones over chlamydial histones, and that the level of automethylation decreases as the amount of histone substrate increases. This research provides new insights into the mechanisms by which Chlamydia trachomatis interacts with host cells and may have implications for understanding the pathogenicity of this bacterium.
A recent study investigated the relationship between inbreeding and human height, analyzing data from over 35,000 individuals from 21 different population samples. The researchers found a significant inverse association between genome-wide homozygosity and height, indicating that inbreeding can lead to a reduction in height. Specifically, the study found that the offspring of first cousins were, on average, 0.4 cm shorter than the offspring of unrelated individuals. This effect remained significant even after controlling for socio-economic status, a potential confounding factor.

The study used three different measures of genomic homozygosity to analyze the data, each capturing a different aspect of the phenomenon. The results showed that all three measures were strongly correlated, but also had some differences, particularly between two of the measures. The association between genome-wide homozygosity and reduced height was highly significant, with a p-value of 2.15 x 10^-5.

The study's findings suggest that multiple, rare, recessive variants contribute to the genetic architecture of human height. This is in line with Fisher's theory, proposed almost a century ago, that the heritability of height results from the combined effects of many genetic variants of individually small effect size. The study's methodology is also applicable to other heritable quantitative traits, paving the way for further research into the effects of inbreeding on a range of traits of biomedical importance.
Researchers have identified a distinct type of immune cell, called a monocyte, that is associated with the body's ability to fight off the parasite that causes malaria. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in the immune system. In people with acute uncomplicated malaria, the researchers found that a specific subset of monocytes, characterized by the presence of certain markers such as CCR2 and CX3CR1, was more prevalent than in healthy individuals who had been exposed to malaria. This subset of monocytes was also more effective at limiting the growth of the malaria parasite in the blood. The researchers found that patients with high levels of this subset of monocytes had lower levels of the parasite in their blood compared to those with lower levels. This suggests that these monocytes may play a key role in fighting off the malaria parasite. The study also found that these monocytes were associated with increased levels of certain inflammatory markers, such as TREM-1, and were more effective at killing the parasite through a process called antibody-dependent cellular inhibition. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of monocytes in the immune response to malaria and suggests that targeting these cells may be a potential strategy for developing new treatments for the disease.
Researchers studied the relationship between Schistosoma mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility in Ugandan men. They found that men infected with S. mansoni had higher levels of immune cells called Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in their blood compared to uninfected men. These cells are more susceptible to HIV infection. The infected men also had more active Th17 cells in their blood, which produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that can contribute to HIV infection. However, the researchers did not find any differences in these immune cells in the foreskin tissue of infected men compared to uninfected men. The foreskin is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection may increase the risk of HIV infection by altering the immune system, but this effect is limited to the blood and does not extend to the foreskin. The researchers conclude that S. mansoni infection may not increase HIV susceptibility in the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men.
Researchers have discovered a key mechanism behind the effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in treating filarial diseases. Filarial nematodes, the parasites responsible for these diseases, have a symbiotic relationship with the bacteria Wolbachia. When Wolbachia is depleted using antibiotics, the nematodes undergo extensive apoptosis, or programmed cell death. This occurs in the adult germline, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilariae and fourth-stage larvae. Surprisingly, apoptosis also occurs in embryonic cells that were not infected with Wolbachia before treatment.

The researchers used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the effects of Wolbachia depletion on nematode cells. They found that the induction of apoptosis is not limited to cells infected with Wolbachia, but rather is a non-cell autonomous response. This suggests that factors produced by Wolbachia in the hypodermal chords, which are populated with large numbers of the bacteria, play a key role in triggering apoptosis.

The pattern of apoptosis correlates closely with the nematode tissues and processes initially affected by Wolbachia depletion, including embryogenesis and long-term sterilization. These effects are sustained for several months until the premature death of the adult worms. The study provides a cellular mechanism to explain the sustained reductions in microfilarial loads and interruption of transmission that occur prior to macrofilaricidal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes. The findings have important implications for the development of new treatments for filarial diseases.
Scientists have been searching for new ways to combat malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Researchers have found that certain compounds, called pantothenate analogues, can kill the parasite by disrupting its ability to make a molecule called coenzyme A (CoA). However, the exact way these compounds work has been unclear. To better understand this process, scientists created strains of the parasite that were resistant to these compounds. By studying these resistant strains, they found that mutations in a gene called Pfpank1 were responsible for the resistance. This gene codes for an enzyme called pantothenate kinase, which helps convert pantothenate into CoA. The mutations in Pfpank1 altered the activity of this enzyme, making the parasite resistant to some pantothenate analogues but hypersensitive to others. This suggests that different classes of pantothenate analogues may work in different ways to kill the parasite. Some may block the production of CoA, while others may interfere with the parasite's use of CoA. These findings provide new insights into how pantothenate analogues work and could lead to the development of more effective treatments for malaria. The study also highlights the importance of the metabolic activation of pantothenate analogues in their antiplasmodial activity.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular nodal conduction time, in African Americans. The study analyzed data from four cohorts of African American individuals, totaling 6,247 participants, using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray. The researchers identified a strong signal associated with a variant in the SCN5A gene, which encodes the cardiac sodium channel, in two of the four cohorts and in the meta-analysis. This variant, rs3922844, explained 2% of PR interval variability in African Americans and was also associated with PR interval duration in individuals of European ancestry, but with a smaller effect size. The study also identified genome-wide significant associations with SNPs in SCN10A, MEIS1, and TBX5, which were highly correlated with SNPs identified in European and Asian genome-wide association studies. The researchers found that African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one cohort, but not in the other three. The study's findings demonstrate the relevance of common variants to African Americans at four loci previously associated with PR interval in European and Asian samples and identify an association signal at one of these loci that is more strongly associated with PR interval in African Americans than in Europeans.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein called ARL8 that plays a crucial role in the replication of a type of virus called Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV). ToMV is a positive-strand RNA virus that replicates its genetic material in the cells of infected plants. The study found that ARL8 forms a complex with another protein called TOM1 and the ToMV replication proteins on the membranes of infected plant cells. This complex is necessary for the efficient replication of the virus.

The researchers used a technique called co-purification to show that ARL8 and TOM1 are associated with the ToMV replication proteins in infected cells. They also found that when ARL8 and TOM1 are present, the ToMV replication proteins are able to synthesize new RNA and add a cap to the 5' end of the RNA, a process called capping. This capping activity is essential for the replication of the virus.

The study suggests that ARL8 and TOM1 work together to activate the replication proteins' ability to synthesize and cap RNA. Without ARL8 and TOM1, the replication proteins are unable to perform these functions, and the virus is unable to replicate efficiently. The researchers also found that mutations in the ARL8 gene completely inhibited the replication of the virus in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of ToMV replication and highlights the importance of ARL8 and TOM1 in this process.
Researchers investigated the role of feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB) inhibition in a basic olfactory circuit in locusts. Inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in many brain systems. In the locust, a subset of lateral horn interneurons (LHNs) was previously thought to provide feed-forward inhibition onto Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain their sparse firing. However, a single inhibitory cell, the giant GABAergic neuron (GGN), was found to be the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, and its inhibition is mediated by a feedback loop including KCs and the GGN.

Using a model of the locust olfactory system, researchers found that both FF and FB inhibition were able to maintain sparse KC responses and provide optimal odor discrimination. However, only FB inhibition could create a phase response consistent with data recorded in vivo. This suggests that the GGN is potentially capable of providing the primary source of inhibition to the KCs. The study highlights the importance of understanding how inhibitory motifs impact post-synaptic neuronal activity, which could reveal unknown inhibitory structures within biological networks. The findings provide general rules for feed-forward versus feedback inhibition and have implications for understanding the neural basis of olfactory learning and memory.
Researchers have developed a new method for diagnosing lyssavirus infections, including rabies, in animals and humans. The method, called dual combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (combo RT-qPCR), uses two complementary techniques to detect different types of lyssaviruses. The first technique uses a probe-based RT-qPCR to detect the rabies virus species, while the second uses an intercalating dye to detect other lyssavirus species.

The combo RT-qPCR method was tested on a large panel of animal samples, covering almost all the genetic variability of lyssaviruses, and was found to have high sensitivity and specificity. The method was also evaluated for diagnosing human rabies on 211 biological samples, including saliva, skin, and brain biopsies, and detected all 41 human cases of rabies tested. The results showed that skin biopsies and saliva samples can be useful for diagnosing rabies in humans.

The combo RT-qPCR method was successfully implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in Cambodia and Morocco, and is considered a relevant and useful tool for diagnosing rabies in both humans and animals. The method represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance and can be used for intra-vitam diagnosis in humans and post-mortem diagnosis in animals.
A recent outbreak of tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis in Ghana resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region. To combat this issue, a control trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito fences in controlling tsetse flies. Two villages were selected, one as a control and the other as an experimental site where 24 pigsties were protected with insecticide-treated mosquito fences. The fences, made of 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester with 100 mg/m2 deltamethrin and a UV protector, were attached to surrounding timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring of tsetse densities showed a significant reduction of over 90% in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. In contrast, the tsetse population in the control village remained unaffected, displaying only seasonal variations. The trypanosome prevalence in pigs was also significantly reduced in the protected village, decreasing from 76% to 16% after three months, compared to a decrease from 72% to 84% in the control village. After six months, 8% of the protected pigs were infected, compared to 60% in the control group. The study suggests that insecticide-treated mosquito nets can be an effective and sustainable method for controlling tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis in resource-poor pig farmers in Ghana.
A recent survey of 441 biomedical journal articles published between 2000 and 2014 found that reproducibility and transparency practices are lacking in the scientific community. Only one study provided a full protocol, and none made all raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare, and only 16 studies had their data included in a subsequent systematic review or meta-analysis. The majority of studies did not mention anything about funding or conflicts of interest. However, there was a significant improvement in transparency over the 15-year period, with a decrease in the percentage of articles with no statement of conflict from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014, and an increase in the percentage of articles reporting statements of conflicts or no conflicts. Articles published in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack information on funding and to have private funding compared to other fields. The study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving reproducibility and transparency in the scientific literature.
Researchers have identified the early host cells targeted by Yersinia pestis, the bacteria responsible for primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal disease with a mortality rate of nearly 100%. The study found that Y. pestis initially targets alveolar macrophages in the lungs, followed by a shift to neutrophils. Macrophages are a type of immune cell that typically helps to fight off infections, but in this case, Y. pestis uses its type III secretion system to deliver proteins that disable the macrophages' ability to respond to the infection. This allows the bacteria to establish a foothold in the lungs without triggering a strong immune response.

The researchers used a fluorescent probe to track the movement of Y. pestis proteins into host cells and found that neutrophils, another type of immune cell, are also targeted by the bacteria. However, unlike macrophages, neutrophils are unable to limit the growth of Y. pestis in the lungs. In fact, the influx of neutrophils ultimately contributes to the severe inflammation and tissue damage characteristic of the pro-inflammatory phase of the disease.

The study suggests that Y. pestis is able to create a localized environment in the lungs that suppresses the host's immune response, allowing the bacteria to thrive. The findings provide new insights into the early stages of pneumonic plague and highlight the importance of understanding the complex interactions between Y. pestis and the host immune system.
Researchers in Brazil conducted a study to evaluate the accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests in detecting asymptomatic infections of Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study involved 136 participants who were part of a cohort with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples were collected in 2001 and tested using ELISA with three different antigens: L. infantum and L. amazonensis crude antigens, and rK39 recombinant protein. The results were compared to molecular biology techniques, which are considered the gold standard for diagnosing VL.

The study found that the ELISA tests were inaccurate in detecting asymptomatic infections, with sensitivity ranging from 26.5% to 49.6% and specificity ranging from 36.8% to 73.7%. The rK39 antigen showed the highest specificity, but the lowest sensitivity. The study also found that there was low agreement among the different antigens used. The researchers concluded that serological tests, such as ELISA, are not reliable for diagnosing asymptomatic infections of Leishmania infantum. This inaccuracy can lead to misclassification bias in population studies, which may have compromised the results of previous studies that used serological assays to estimate prevalence, evaluate intervention programs, or identify risk factors for Leishmania infection.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the regulation of retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells using microarray analysis. Retrotransposons are repetitive elements in the genome that can amplify and potentially disrupt gene function if not properly silenced. The study found that a histone deacetylase called Hdac1 plays a key role in silencing retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells. The researchers used a computational approach to analyze microarray data and identify retrotransposons that are targeted by different silencing mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and polycomb repressive complexes. They found that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retrotransposons in embryonic stem cells, and that different genomic copies of the same retrotransposon can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms. The study also identified new target retrotransposons for polycomb repressive complexes and Hdac1 histone deacetylase in mouse embryonic stem cells. This research provides new insights into the complex interplay between silencing mechanisms that repress retrotransposon loci in germ cells and embryonic stem cells, and highlights the importance of Hdac1 in regulating retrotransposon expression. The study's methodology can be applied to gene expression microarray data to generate new insights into retrotransposon regulation in mammals and identify further components of the defense mechanisms that protect the mammalian genome from retrotransposition.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the protein CRY2 plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time in response to light. CRY2 interacts with a group of proteins called CIBs, which are part of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. Specifically, CRY2 interacts with CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 in response to blue light, but not in darkness or in response to other wavelengths of light. These interactions activate the transcription of the FT (Flowering Locus T) gene, which is essential for flowering.

In vitro experiments showed that CIB1 binds to the canonical E-box DNA sequence with higher affinity than to non-canonical E-box sequences. However, in vivo, CIB1 binds to the chromatin region of the FT promoter, which contains only non-canonical E-box sequences. Further analysis revealed that CIB1 and other CIB proteins form heterodimers, which have a higher binding affinity to non-canonical E-box sequences than homodimers. This explains why CIB1 binds to non-canonical E-boxes in vivo, despite its higher affinity for canonical E-boxes in vitro.

Genetic analysis demonstrated that CIB1, CIB2, CIB4, and CIB5 act redundantly to activate the transcription of FT and are positive regulators of CRY2-mediated flowering. The expression of CIB proteins is specifically regulated by blue light, consistent with the hypothesis that different CIB proteins play similar roles in the CRY2-mediated blue light signaling pathway. Overall, this study shows that CIBs function redundantly in regulating CRY2-dependent flowering and that different CIBs form heterodimers to interact with non-canonical E-box DNA in vivo.
Researchers evaluated the effectiveness and cost of different approaches to treating intestinal parasites in US-bound refugees from Asia. Intestinal parasites such as hookworm, Trichuris trichuria, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Strongyloides stercoralis are rare in the US but common in the refugees' home countries. The study compared four options: no treatment, domestic screening and treatment in the US, overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermectin, and overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and domestic screening for Strongyloides.

The analysis found that overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermectin was the most cost-effective option, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by around 80% at a net cost of $458,718 per death averted. This option was also less expensive than domestic screening and treatment programs. The addition of ivermectin to albendazole reduced the prevalence of chronic strongyloidiasis and the risk of rare but potentially fatal disseminated strongyloidiasis.

The study used a Markov process model to estimate the long-term effects of parasitic infections and health outcomes, including outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, life years, and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The results suggest that overseas presumptive treatment is a cost-effective intervention that is less expensive and at least as effective as domestic screening and treatment programs.
Researchers have discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematocida displodere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike other microsporidian parasites, N. displodere has a broad tissue tropism, meaning it can infect and replicate in multiple host tissues, including the muscle, neurons, epidermis, intestine, coelomocytes, and seam cells. This is distinct from other Nematocida species, such as N. parisii, which only infects and replicates in the intestine.

The researchers characterized the life cycle of N. displodere, including its pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. They found that N. displodere can invade multiple host tissues, but most replication occurs in the muscle and epidermis, rather than the intestine. The genome of N. displodere was compared to that of N. parisii and N. sp. 1, revealing that N. displodere is the earliest diverging species of the Nematocida genus.

Over 10% of the proteins encoded by the N. displodere genome belong to a single species-specific family of RING-domain containing proteins, which may play a role in interactions with the host. The discovery of N. displodere provides a new model system for studying the mechanisms and evolutionary bases of pathogen tissue tropism.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CSB) plays a crucial role in repairing damaged DNA in a process called transcription-coupled DNA repair. CSB is a member of a family of proteins that use energy from ATP to reorganize chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes. However, it was unclear how CSB's chromatin remodeling activity contributed to DNA repair. In this study, scientists found that CSB can reposition nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, in an ATP-dependent manner, and that this activity is greatly enhanced by the presence of NAP1-like histone chaperones. These chaperones are proteins that help assemble and disassemble histones, the proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin. The researchers showed that the combined activities of CSB and the NAP1-like chaperones are necessary for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. They also found that CSB has two separate functions in this process: one involves recruiting repair proteins, while the other involves reorganizing chromatin. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of transcription-coupled DNA repair and sheds light on the underlying causes of Cockayne syndrome, a devastating disease caused by mutations in the CSB gene. The findings also highlight the importance of collaboration between chromatin remodelers and histone chaperones in regulating chromatin structure and function.
Researchers have created a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome, identifying areas where DNA methylation patterns differ significantly between individuals. These areas, called Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs), are found at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions of the genome. While most VMRs have a strong genetic component, a subset shows low heritability and is influenced by environmental factors. These environmentally responsive VMRs form co-regulated networks that are specific to each cell type and are enriched for genes involved in cell-type specific functions. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 VMRs is enriched for genes involved in T-cell activation, while in fibroblasts, a network of 34 VMRs is enriched for genes controlling tissue growth. In neurons, a network of 18 VMRs is enriched for genes involved in synaptic signaling. The researchers also found that some VMRs are sensitive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels changing in response to changes in the cellular environment. This suggests that epigenetic variation is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The study provides new insights into the biology of epigenetic variation in the human genome and highlights the importance of considering both genetic and environmental factors in understanding epigenetic variation.
Researchers have developed a new rapid test for diagnosing dengue fever, a mosquito-borne disease that affects millions of people worldwide. The test, called the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid, detects a protein called NS1, which is present in the blood of people infected with the dengue virus. When used alone, the test showed a sensitivity of 69.2% and specificity of 96% in a study conducted in Vietnam. However, when used in combination with a test that detects antibodies against the virus, the sensitivity increased to 93.0%. A similar study in Malaysia showed similar results, with a sensitivity of 68.9% and specificity of 96.7% when used alone, and a sensitivity of 89.0% when used in combination with the antibody test.

The researchers found that using the NS1 test in combination with the antibody test significantly increased the sensitivity of dengue diagnosis and extended the window of detection to include very early acute samples. This is important because dengue fever can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages of the disease. The study suggests that using both tests together can improve the accuracy of dengue diagnosis and enhance the clinical utility of rapid immunochromatographic testing for the disease. The results of this study have the potential to improve the diagnosis and treatment of dengue fever, which is a significant public health concern in many parts of the world.
Researchers have developed a new computational method called Transat to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including those that are transient, pseudo-knotted, and alternative. Current RNA structure prediction methods assume a unique functional RNA structure and do not account for features required for in vivo folding. Transat detects conserved helices of high statistical significance and can predict the structural features of known reference structures, including pseudo-knotted ones and alternative structural configurations. The method can also identify unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provides evidence for new helices that may define folding pathways. Unlike existing methods, Transat works in a comparative way, highlighting conserved features and not requiring a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment. This approach has the advantage of not being able to predict features as a function of time, but it can provide a more accurate understanding of how RNA sequences fold in vivo. The researchers hope that Transat will enable more comprehensive and systematic studies of RNA folding pathways and alternative structural configurations, and provide useful input to the design and interpretation of future experiments. Transat's predictions may also support the notion that homologous RNA sequences not only assume similar functional RNA structures, but also fold in a similar way.
Researchers studied the immune system of plants, specifically Arabidopsis, to understand how it protects against pathogens. They found that the plant's immune network is highly buffered, meaning that different parts of the network can compensate for each other's functions when one part is disabled by a pathogen. This buffering makes it difficult to study the individual components of the network using traditional genetic methods. To overcome this challenge, the researchers used a network reconstitution strategy, which involves disassembling and reassembling the immune network step by step. This approach allowed them to identify the regulatory mechanisms underlying the plant's response to an immune stimulant called flagellin-22 (flg22). The researchers discovered that the immune network is composed of four sub-networks, or sectors, which interact with each other to produce a robust response to flg22. They found that many of these interactions result in network buffering, which conceals the functions of individual components. The study also showed that traditional genetic methods, such as single-gene null-mutant analysis, are not effective in detecting the regulatory mechanisms of the immune network. Instead, the researchers used high-order perturbation and dynamic transcriptional profiling to decipher the regulation of the complex network. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of network reconstitution as a powerful approach to understanding the function of complex biological networks, particularly those that are highly resilient against perturbations.
Researchers have identified the genetic mechanisms that control the development of the larval eye and optic lobe in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. During embryonic development, the Drosophila optic placode produces both the larval eye photoreceptors (PRs) and the precursors of the optic lobe. The researchers found that the proneural factor Atonal (Ato) specifies larval eye precursors, while the orphan nuclear receptor Tailless (Tll) is crucial for the specification of optic lobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of Ato and Tll to coordinate neural precursor specification in a timely manner. The correct spatial placement of the boundary between Ato and Tll is required to control the precise number of primary and secondary PR precursors. Notch signaling also controls a binary cell fate decision, defining PR subtype identity. The researchers mapped the expression patterns of proteins in the optic placode and found that the boundary between larval eye and optic lobe precursors is established through the interactions of transcriptional regulators and signaling pathways. The study provides a new model of how the subdivision of precursor domains emerges in the Drosophila optic placode. The findings demonstrate how combinatorial action of cell extrinsic and cell intrinsic factors controls neural tissue patterning.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism of action for human beta defensin 1 (hBD1), a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide found in the human body. The study found that the reduced form of hBD1, but not its oxidized form, forms a net-like structure that traps and prevents the migration of bacteria. This mechanism is distinct from other antimicrobial peptides, such as human alpha-defensin 6 (HD6), and is independent of bacterial killing. The nets formed by hBD1 are stable in the presence of human duodenal secretions and can prevent the migration of bacteria that are resistant to hBD1.

The discovery was made using electron microscopy, which revealed the net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with the reduced form of hBD1. A transmigration assay confirmed that the nets capture bacteria and inhibit their migration. The study suggests that the reduced form of hBD1 provides additional host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular net structures, preventing bacterial invasion. This new mechanism of action highlights the multifunctional activities of hBD1 and its importance in shaping the human microbiota. The findings have implications for the development of new antimicrobial strategies, as they demonstrate that a single peptide can provide distinct and complementary killing-based and killing-independent antimicrobial mechanisms.
Researchers studied the protein OCRL1, which is linked to Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease, to understand its role in the kidneys. They used zebrafish as a model to study the protein's function in the pronephric tubule, a structure similar to the mammalian renal tubule. The study found that a deficiency of OCRL1 caused a defect in endocytosis, the process by which cells take in substances from outside the cell. This defect resulted in reduced levels of the scavenger receptor megalin and its accumulation in endocytic compartments. The researchers also observed reduced numbers of early endocytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in the sub-apical region of pronephric cells. However, cell polarity within the pronephric tubule was unaffected in mutant embryos. The study suggests that OCRL1 is required for endocytic trafficking in vivo and that endocytic defects are responsible for the renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 disease. Furthermore, the study reveals PIP5K as a potential therapeutic target for these diseases. The researchers were able to rescue the endocytic defect in OCRL1-deficient embryos by suppressing PIP5K, indicating that the levels of PtdIns(4,5)P2 are crucial for endocytic trafficking in the renal tubule.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the transmission of Rift Valley fever (RVF) in livestock in the Kilombero River Valley in Tanzania. The study aimed to determine the presence of RVF antibodies in cattle, sheep, and goats during the inter-epidemic period, four years after a major outbreak in 2006/07. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to August 2011, where blood samples from 1680 animals were tested for RVF antibodies using two commercial ELISA kits. The results showed an overall seroprevalence of 11.3%, with 5.5% of animals born after the 2006/07 outbreak and 22.7% of animals present during the outbreak testing positive for RVF antibodies. The study also found that animals living more than 15 kilometers from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those living closer to the flood plain.

The study's findings indicate that RVF is being transmitted in the study area during the inter-epidemic period. The linear increase in seroprevalence in the post-epidemic annual cohorts suggests a constant exposure to the virus and the presence of active foci of transmission before the survey. The study also found that there was no significant difference in seroprevalence between male and female animals born after the outbreak, but a significant difference was observed between male and female animals present during the outbreak. The study's results provide baseline information on the exposure status of livestock to RVF in the Kilombero River Valley and highlight the need for regular serological surveillance to detect inter-epidemic transmissions.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, has a unique feature called the contractile vacuole complex (CVC) that helps it regulate its internal environment. Researchers have discovered that the CVC plays a crucial role in the parasite's ability to infect host cells. They found that a protein called TcRab11, which is part of the CVC, helps transport a protein called trans-sialidase (TcTS) to the parasite's surface. TcTS is essential for the parasite's ability to infect host cells, as it helps the parasite evade the host's immune system by modifying its surface proteins.

The researchers used a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches to study the role of TcRab11 and the CVC in the parasite's life cycle. They found that when TcRab11 is not functioning properly, the parasite is unable to transport TcTS to its surface, leading to reduced infectivity. However, when the researchers added exogenous TcTS to the parasite, they were able to partially restore its infectivity. This suggests that TcRab11 plays a critical role in the trafficking of TcTS to the parasite's surface, and that this process is essential for the parasite's ability to infect host cells.

These findings provide new insights into the biology of T. cruzi and highlight the importance of the CVC in the parasite's life cycle. They also suggest that the CVC may be a potential target for the development of new treatments for Chagas disease.
Researchers conducted a phase III clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen for rabies vaccination. The trial involved 443 participants, including children, adolescents, and adults, who received a purified chick-embryo cell rabies vaccine (PCECV) through a 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen or a 2-site/Thai Red Cross (TRC) regimen, with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG) administration. The study found that the 4-site/1-week regimen was non-inferior to the 2-site/TRC regimen in terms of the percentage of participants with adequate rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RVNA) concentrations at 49 days post-vaccination. All participants achieved adequate RVNA concentrations by 14 days post-vaccination. The study also found that RVNA concentrations were consistently lower in adults who received HRIG compared to those who did not. The two regimens had similar safety profiles, with no vaccination-related serious adverse events reported. The results suggest that the 4-site/1-week regimen could be an alternative to current recommendations, offering potential benefits in terms of improved cost-efficiency and compliance to vaccination.
Researchers used high-resolution brain imaging data from the Human Connectome Project to study the brain's salience network (SN), which plays a key role in detecting and responding to important events. The study found that the SN has a unique and dynamic organization, characterized by high flexibility in its connections with other brain networks, including those involved in attention and cognitive control. This flexibility allows the SN to interact with a wide range of brain regions and support various cognitive processes.

The researchers used graph-theoretical techniques to analyze the SN's dynamic interactions with other brain networks, including the frontoparietal network, cingulate-opercular network, and ventral and dorsal attention networks. They found that the SN's connections with these networks were highly variable over time, indicating a high degree of flexibility. Additionally, the SN's nodes, or brain regions, maintained a high level of centrality, or importance, over time, suggesting that the SN acts as a hub for facilitating interactions between different brain networks.

The study also found that the SN's connectivity profiles were distinct from those of other prefrontal control systems, and that the SN's temporal flexibility predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were consistent across two separate datasets, demonstrating the robustness of the results. Overall, the study provides new insights into the dynamic functional architecture of the SN and its role in facilitating interactions between different brain networks to support a wide range of cognitive processes.
Researchers have identified a key protein, VP4, that plays a crucial role in the release of the nonenveloped virus SV40 from host cells. Unlike enveloped viruses, which are surrounded by a lipid membrane, nonenveloped viruses like SV40 must be released from the cell without a membrane. The study found that VP4, a protein expressed late in the viral life cycle, is responsible for disrupting the host cell membrane, allowing the virus to escape. This process involves the formation of small pores, approximately 3 nanometers in diameter, in the cell membrane. The researchers discovered that the hydrophobic domain of VP4 is essential for its ability to bind to and disrupt membranes. They also found that VP4 has a preference for membranes composed of lipids similar to those found in plasma membranes, rather than nuclear membranes. Additionally, the study showed that phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid found in bacterial membranes, inhibits the membrane-disrupting activity of VP4. The results suggest that VP4 acts as a viroporin, a protein that forms pores in the host cell membrane to facilitate viral release. This process is crucial for the efficient spread of the virus, as it allows the virus to escape the host cell and infect other cells. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of nonenveloped viral release and highlights the importance of VP4 in this process.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine to protect against dengue fever, a serious disease spread by mosquitoes in tropical and subtropical regions. The vaccine, called pcTPANS1, contains a protein called NS1, which is a key component of the dengue virus. Studies in mice showed that the vaccine induced a strong immune response, including the production of antibodies and the activation of immune cells called T cells. The researchers found that both the antibodies and T cells were necessary for protection against the virus, and that the T cells, specifically a type called CD4+ T cells, played a crucial role in the immune response. When CD4+ T cells were removed from the mice, the vaccine was no longer effective. The researchers also found that transferring CD4+ T cells and antibodies from vaccinated mice to unvaccinated mice provided protection against the virus. These findings suggest that a combination of antibodies and CD4+ T cells is necessary for effective protection against dengue fever. The study provides new insights into the immune response to the NS1 protein and has implications for the development of a dengue vaccine. The researchers believe that their findings could lead to the creation of an effective vaccine against dengue fever, which is currently a major public health problem with no available antiviral treatment.
Researchers have studied the cell-to-cell communication system in Gram-positive bacteria, specifically the ComRS system in streptococci. This system relies on a signaling peptide called XIP, which activates the transcription factor ComR. ComR is a new member of the RNPP family, which regulates important bacterial processes such as sporulation, conjugation, and virulence. The researchers used crystal structure analysis, mutational analysis, and in vivo assays to understand how ComR is activated by XIP. They found that XIP binding releases the sequestered DNA-binding domain of ComR, allowing it to dimerize and bind to DNA. This activation mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, making it distinct from other RNPP family members. The researchers also identified key residues on XIP and ComR that are important for competence activation, which could be targeted to control gene exchange among streptococci. This study provides a detailed molecular mechanism of ComR activation and offers opportunities to engineer peptide-based expression systems in streptococci and other Gram-positive bacteria. The ComRS system is a potential target for developing new antibacterial agents, as it plays a crucial role in streptococcal competence and gene exchange.
Scientists have discovered a way to activate a type of protein called ELIC, which is a part of a larger family of proteins called pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs). These proteins are found in all animals and play a crucial role in transmitting signals between nerve cells. ELIC was previously difficult to study because researchers didn't know what molecules could activate it. By testing a library of molecules, researchers found that certain primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, can activate ELIC at high concentrations. These molecules bind to a specific site on the protein and trigger the opening of a channel that allows positively charged ions to pass through. The channel's properties are similar to those of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, another type of pLGIC. The researchers used a combination of techniques, including X-ray crystallography and electrophysiology, to study ELIC's structure and function. They found that the channel is cation-selective, meaning it allows positively charged ions to pass through while blocking negatively charged ions. The discovery of ELIC's activators opens up new possibilities for studying the mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in pLGICs, which are important for understanding how nerve cells communicate with each other.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) plays a key role in the development of asthma in individuals with eczema or atopic dermatitis (AD). The study found that mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like skin inflammation and were susceptible to allergic asthma, similar to humans with AD. The researchers showed that TSLP, produced by skin keratinocytes, is the systemic driver of this bronchial hyper-responsiveness.

In the study, mice with keratinocyte-specific deletion of RBP-j, which sustained high systemic levels of TSLP, developed a severe asthmatic phenotype when exposed to an allergen. Elimination of TSLP signaling in these animals blocked the development of asthma, demonstrating that high serum TSLP levels are required to sensitize the lung to allergic inflammation. The researchers also found that epidermal-derived TSLP was sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing the lung airways to inhaled allergens in the absence of epicutaneous sensitization.

The study suggests that in addition to early treatment of the primary skin-barrier defects, selective inhibition of systemic TSLP may be the key to blocking the development of asthma in AD patients. The researchers propose that the skin acts as a signaling organ, driving susceptibility to allergic inflammation in the lung by releasing TSLP. The findings provide a novel molecular mechanism for the atopic march and highlight the importance of TSLP in the development of asthma in individuals with AD.
Researchers analyzed the genome of Thermotoga maritima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium, using a combination of genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. This integrated approach allowed for a detailed annotation of various genomic features, including protein-coding genes, non-coding RNAs, transcription units, promoters, and ribosome binding sites. The analysis revealed several distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome compared to other bacteria. The genome has a high number of genes per transcription unit (3.3), a low number of putative non-coding RNAs (12), and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites (3.7%). The promoters and ribosome binding sites in T. maritima are highly conserved, and the 5' untranslated regions follow an atypical bimodal length distribution. Transcriptional regulation is limited by a lack of intergenic space for most transcription units. Notably, a high fraction of annotated genes are expressed independently of growth state, and there is a strong linear correlation between mRNA and protein abundance (Pearson r = 0.63, p < 2.2 × 10^(-16)). These characteristics are thought to be a reflection of the organism's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and may provide insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on Earth. The integrated analysis framework used in this study can be applied to other microbial species, offering a valuable resource for the research community.
Researchers investigated how visual context influences the perception of a target bar in a display. Participants judged whether a target bar was present at the center of a display, given a weak or missing input contrast at the target location with or without a context of other bars. The results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when the context had a weaker contrast. When the context could be grouped with the target, weak contrast contextual bars biased observers to perceive a target, while high-contrast contextual bars biased observers to perceive no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference was used to account for the data, suggesting that context influences perception in two ways: by biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present and by biasing their internal model of the likely input contrasts caused by a target bar. The study found that the context did not influence the perceived target contrast, suggesting that areas beyond the primary visual cortex are responsible for visual inferences. The results also showed that high-contrast contextual bars suppressed the perception of the target, while low-contrast contextual bars filled in the target, even when there was zero target contrast in the input image.
Biologists have long been puzzled by the prevalence of cooperation in nature, particularly in the production of costly common goods. This is because cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors, which can consume the common good without contributing fairly, leading to population collapse and the destruction of cooperation. However, researchers have found that defectors can sometimes create conditions that rescue cooperation. In a structured population, defectors can increase the heterogeneity in population collapse dynamics, reducing the chances that all populations go extinct simultaneously. Additionally, selection for rare mutants adapted to resource limitation, which can be induced by defectors, introduces another population bottleneck, facilitating the survival of cooperation. When defectors are initially present, they can create empty locations that support cooperator but not defector migrants, allowing cooperators to grow. This can lead to the counterintuitive result that the initial presence of defectors in a population can sometimes improve the survival of cooperators. Furthermore, resource limitation, precipitated by defectors, can select for rare cooperator and defector mutants adapted to this limitation, favoring cooperation. These factors act together to generate large variation in cooperator frequency across a metapopulation, promoting cooperation. Overall, the study suggests that defectors can provide a "built-in" mechanism for the persistence of cooperation in structured populations.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the body eliminates the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that can cause infections in people with compromised epithelial barriers, such as those with cystic fibrosis. The study found that P. aeruginosa adheres to apoptotic cells, which are cells that have undergone programmed cell death, and is then engulfed by surrounding epithelial cells through a process called efferocytosis. This process involves the engulfment and disposal of apoptotic cells by surrounding cells, and in this case, it also leads to the elimination of P. aeruginosa.

The researchers observed that P. aeruginosa binds to apoptotic cells at multi-cellular junctions in the epithelial barrier, and that this binding is independent of the type of cell death. The bacteria are then internalized by the surrounding epithelial cells, where they inhabit an efferocytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features. After 24 hours, the P. aeruginosa is eliminated intracellularly.

This discovery suggests that efferocytosis may be a host defense mechanism that helps to eliminate P. aeruginosa from the body. The study's findings have implications for the study of cystic fibrosis, a condition characterized by an exacerbated number of apoptotic cells and ineffective efferocytosis. The researchers propose that understanding this mechanism could lead to new strategies for preventing P. aeruginosa infections in people with compromised epithelial barriers.
In the early stages of Drosophila embryonic development, the formation of the gonad involves the migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) to the somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGPs). To reach the SGPs, PGCs must traverse the midgut wall and migrate through the mesoderm, guided by local repulsive cues and attractive signals from the SGPs. The hedgehog (hh) pathway gene shifted (shf) plays a crucial role in directing PGC migration. Shf is a secreted protein that facilitates the long-distance transmission of Hh through the proteoglycan matrix. It is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm and is required for PGC migration, as demonstrated by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. The hmgcr-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway also plays a key role in generating the PGC attractant, which is produced by the SGPs and other tissues when hmgcr is ectopically expressed. The production of this attractant depends on shf and another hh pathway gene, gγ1. Ectopic expression of hmgcr in the nervous system promotes the release and transmission of the Hh ligand from these cells into the underlying mesodermal cell layer, where it can contact migrating PGCs. The potentiation of Hh by hmgcr appears to depend on cholesterol modification.
A new study has investigated the effectiveness of a vaccine against HIV, specifically a trivalent adenovirus type 5 HIV recombinant vaccine. The research aimed to understand how the vaccine primes the immune system to recognize and eliminate HIV-infected cells. The study found that the vaccine induced a modest level of cytotoxic capacity in HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells, which are a type of immune cell that can kill infected cells. This cytotoxic capacity was greatest in individuals with certain HLA class I alleles, such as B*27, B*57, or B*58, which have been associated with immune control over HIV replication in chronic infection.

The study measured the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in vaccine recipients, HIV-negative individuals, and chronically infected patients, including those with durable control over HIV replication (LTNP). The results showed that vaccine recipients had readily detectable HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell recall cytotoxic responses, which were significantly higher than those observed in HIV-negative controls. However, the magnitude of these responses was not related to the number of vaccinations or the percentages of cytokine-secreting T-cells.

The study's findings suggest that protective HLA class I alleles may lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and following immunization due to more efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell cytotoxic responses. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying protection from HIV infection or immune control over HIV replication, which is essential for the development of future HIV vaccine design strategies.
Researchers have proposed that the evolution of modern human cognition was driven by the development of jointly intentional behavior, where individuals work together towards a common goal. A new study formally models the co-evolution of jointly intentional behavior and cumulative culture, showing that rapid technological advancements are linked to the emergence of this ability. In the absence of opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to undertake jointly intentional behavior is selected against. The study provides a unified mechanism for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior. The emergence of shared intentions at a time of significant technological advance is consistent with evidence that composite tool manufacture and grammatical language evolved around the same time, approximately 300,000 years ago. The study suggests that collaborative sharing of intentions directly affects how strategies are chosen, but not which strategies are chosen, and that an environment rich in coordination problems would be conducive to the emergence of jointly intentional behavior. The study formally models the evolution of jointly intentional action and shows under what conditions it is likely to emerge, providing new insights into the link between technology adoption and the evolution of collaboration.
Researchers have identified two microRNAs, miR-34b/c and miR-449, that play a crucial role in male fertility. These microRNAs are responsible for regulating the production of high-quality sperm in mice. A deficiency in these microRNAs leads to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia, a condition characterized by low sperm count, poor sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. This condition is the leading cause of male infertility in humans. The study found that the loss of miR-34b/c and miR-449 does not block the process of spermatogenesis, but rather impairs several developmental transitions, resulting in the characteristic features of oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. The researchers observed that the absence of these microRNAs leads to a thinning of the epithelium in the seminiferous tubules and a decrease in the quantity and quality of mature sperm. The sperm of mice lacking miR-34b/c and miR-449 were found to be immotile and had aberrant morphology. The study suggests that the miR-34 family has multiple functions during spermatogenesis, regulating both meiosis and the later stages of sperm maturation. The findings identify the miR-34b/c and miR-449 as the first microRNA loci required for mammalian spermatogenesis, and their deregulation is causal to oligoasthenoteratozoospermia and infertility.
Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the mechanisms behind its probiotic properties are not fully understood. EcN produces two compounds, siderophore-microcins (Mcc) and the genotoxin colibactin, which are encoded by the pks island. Colibactin is a virulence factor and a potential carcinogen. Researchers aimed to separate the beneficial effects of EcN from its genotoxic activity. They found that the ClbP protein, which activates colibactin, is necessary for EcN's antagonistic activity against other bacteria. However, a single amino acid substitution in ClbP inactivated the genotoxic activity while maintaining the antibacterial effect. In a salmonellosis model, the mutant strain reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly to the wild-type strain. The ClbP-dependent antibacterial effect was also observed in other E. coli strains that carry both the Mcc gene cluster and the pks island. The study suggests that the genomic islands encoding colibactin, salmochelin, and siderophore-Mcc biosynthetic pathways were co-selected and played a role in the evolution of E. coli from phylogroup B2. This co-evolution highlights the fine line between pathogenicity and probiotic activity, and the need to address both the effectiveness and safety of probiotics. Decoupling the antagonistic from the genotoxic activity by inactivating ClbP opens the way to the safe use of EcN.
Researchers have identified two transporters, Uxt1 and Uxt2, that play a crucial role in the virulence of the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. This fungus is a leading cause of fungal meningitis worldwide and is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. The transporters, Uxt1 and Uxt2, are responsible for transporting the sugar molecule UDP-xylose, a key component of the fungus's anti-phagocytic polysaccharide capsule. The capsule is a major virulence factor that helps the fungus evade the host's immune system.

The researchers found that Uxt1 and Uxt2 are necessary for the incorporation of xylose into the capsule and for the fungus to cause disease in mice. However, surprisingly, the transporters are not necessary for the fungus's viability in the context of infection. This suggests that the transporters play a specific role in the fungus's ability to cause disease, rather than being essential for its survival.

The discovery of Uxt1 and Uxt2 provides new insights into the biology of Cryptococcus neoformans and may lead to the development of new treatments for cryptococcal infections. The researchers also identified the first fungal transporters that transport UDP-xylose and UDP-galactofuranose, expanding our understanding of glycan biosynthesis in this pathogen.
Researchers have developed an open-access global database for mapping, control, and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The database provides georeferenced data on NTDs, including schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, and leishmaniasis, which can be used for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, and monitoring and surveillance. The database contains over 12,000 georeferenced schistosomiasis survey locations from 35 African countries and is available online at http://www.gntd.org. The database was created by systematically searching the literature, contacting Ministries of Health and research institutions in schistosomiasis-endemic countries, and extracting, georeferencing, and storing the data in a MySQL database with a web interface. The database is currently being expanded to include other NTDs, such as ascariasis, hookworm disease, trichuriasis, lymphatic filariasis, onchocerciasis, and trachoma. An open-access, spatially explicit NTD database offers unique opportunities for disease risk modeling, targeting control interventions, disease monitoring, and surveillance. The database also allows for detailed geostatistical analyses of disease distribution in space and time. The researchers demonstrate that the establishment and running of a global NTD database is feasible and should be expanded without delay.
Chronic helminth infections, which are caused by parasitic worms, have long been thought to worsen the course of tuberculosis (TB), a bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). However, a recent study in cotton rats, a natural host for the filarial nematode Litomosoides sigmodontis, found that chronic helminth infections do not exacerbate MTB infection. In fact, the study found that co-infected animals had equivalent or reduced mycobacterial burdens compared to those infected with only MTB.

The study, which used cotton rats as a model for human TB, found that chronic filarial infection did not alter the control of MTB. Histological examinations and quantitative MTB cultures from two independent experiments demonstrated that co-infected animals had similar or reduced mycobacterial loads compared to those infected with only MTB. The study also found that co-infected animals had similar spleen cell proliferation and interferon gamma production in response to MTB antigens, suggesting that the helminth infection did not suppress the immune response to MTB.

The findings of this study suggest that filaria eradication programs may not facilitate MTB control, and that it may be possible to develop worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases without increasing the risk of infections. The study's results also suggest that the immunomodulatory effects of chronic helminth infection can be overcome in the setting of an active MTB infection.
Researchers studied the role of a specific ion channel, ppk23, in the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly. They found that ppk23 is expressed in a subset of sensory neurons that are involved in detecting chemical cues, such as pheromones. Pheromones are chemical signals that convey information between individuals of the same species. The researchers discovered that disrupting ppk23 or blocking the activity of neurons expressing ppk23 did not affect the flies' ability to taste or respond to food. However, it did affect their courtship behavior. Males with disrupted ppk23 or blocked neurons took longer to initiate courtship and were less likely to engage in it. Additionally, they were less responsive to a specific pheromone that is attractive to females. These findings suggest that ppk23 plays a crucial role in the sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Drosophila. The researchers propose that ppk23 may be a pheromone receptor or a key component of the pheromonal signaling pathway. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying courtship behavior in Drosophila and highlights the importance of ppk23 in this process. Further research is needed to understand the interactions between ppk23 and other receptors involved in courtship behavior.
Researchers studied how mitochondria in the green alga Chlamydomonas import tRNAs from the cytosol to ensure proper translation. They found a precise correlation between the mitochondrial codon usage and the nature and amount of imported tRNAs. This led to the hypothesis that tRNA import might be a dynamic process that adapts to the mitochondrial genome content. To test this, the researchers manipulated the Chlamydomonas mitochondrial genome by introducing point mutations to modify its codon usage. They found that this modification resulted in reduced levels of mitochondrial translation and decreased levels and activities of respiratory complexes. These effects were linked to the limitations of the pool of tRNAs in mitochondria. The study suggests that tRNA mitochondrial import is not a dynamic process that can rapidly adapt to changes in the mitochondrial genome, but rather a co-evolved adaptation between the tRNA import mechanism and the requirements of the mitochondrial translation machinery. The researchers propose that the steady-state levels of imported tRNAs in mitochondria result from a co-evolutionary process between the tRNA import mechanism and the mitochondrial genome. This study provides new insights into the regulation of mitochondrial translation and the importance of codon usage in determining translational efficiency.
Researchers have identified new patterns of glucose dysregulation in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Current methods for measuring blood glucose levels are limited by relying on single-time-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. The study used CGM to evaluate postprandial glucose elevations, types of patterns, and how patterns vary between individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. The results show that even individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibit high glucose variability, with glucose levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. This suggests that glucose dysregulation is more prevalent and heterogeneous than previously thought and can affect individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures. The study developed an analytical framework that groups individuals according to specific patterns of glycemic responses, called "glucotypes," which reveal subphenotypes within traditional diagnostic categories of glucose regulation. The findings highlight the personal nature of glucose regulation and suggest that an increase in glucose variability might precede the currently used measures defining abnormal glucose levels, representing an earlier stage of "prediabetes." The study also developed a model for identifying potential mechanisms of personal glucose dysregulation and a webtool for visualizing and classifying individualized glucose patterns into glucotypes.
Scientists have long known that mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling cascades play a crucial role in regulating plant defense against pathogens. However, the exact mechanisms behind this process were not well understood. A recent study has shed light on the role of a protein called EDR1, which acts as a negative regulator of plant defense responses and cell death. Researchers found that EDR1 physically interacts with two other proteins, MKK4 and MKK5, which are part of the MAPK cascade. This interaction is necessary for EDR1 to negatively regulate the activity of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade. As a result, EDR1 helps to fine-tune plant innate immunity by preventing excessive activation of the MAPK cascade.

The study used Arabidopsis plants to investigate the relationship between EDR1 and the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 kinase cascade. They found that edr1 mutants, which lack the EDR1 protein, have highly activated MPK3/MPK6 kinase activity and higher levels of MPK3/MPK6 proteins than wild-type plants. This suggests that EDR1 normally acts to suppress the activity of the MKK4/MKK5-MPK3/MPK6 cascade. The researchers also found that mutations in the mkk4 and mkk5 genes, which encode MKK4 and MKK5, respectively, suppress the resistance to pathogens seen in edr1 mutants. This indicates that MKK4 and MKK5 are key players in plant immunity responses. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of plant defense and the role of EDR1 in regulating the MAPK cascade.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. This framework uses a statistical method called Gaussian processes to identify complex patterns in disease data and make reliable predictions. The researchers tested their framework on data from Turkey between 2004 and 2015 and found that it outperformed two commonly used machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted regression trees. The framework can be used to predict disease cases in different locations and time periods, which can help public health officials make informed decisions to control and prevent the spread of disease. The framework combines data from different locations and time periods to identify patterns and make predictions, and it can be used for temporal, spatial, or spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases. The researchers believe that their framework has the potential to make a significant contribution to public health policy-making. The framework's ability to capture complex dependencies and make reliable predictions makes it a valuable tool for understanding and controlling the spread of infectious diseases.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the transmission dynamics of Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a mosquito-borne disease that affects humans and livestock in Africa and the Middle East. The model takes into account seasonal and socioeconomic factors that contribute to the spread of the disease. The study found that human activities, such as the Eid al-Adha festival, and climatic factors like rainfall and hydrological variations, play a significant role in the transmission and dispersal of the disease. The model suggests that outbreaks may occur when there is a combination of abundant livestock and mosquitoes in areas at risk.

The researchers used a three-patch model to simulate the transmission dynamics of RVFV over short and long periods, including during the festival time. They found that the risk of massive disease outbreaks increases when the time for festival preparation starts earlier than usual. The study also investigated the impact of factors such as the number of livestock imported daily, animal transportation speed, and death rate induced by ceremonial sacrifices on the patterns of disease outbreaks.

The model did not directly consider human compartments, but human activities were reflected through periodic parameters such as livestock importation and transportation. The study suggests that temporal superposition of risk factors can be predicted in advance, allowing for potential interventions to prevent or mitigate outbreaks. The researchers propose that their model can be extended to consider disease latencies in hosts and vectors, as well as the importation of livestock carrying RVFV during disease latency. The study aims to provide information to local governments on how to predict and control the transmission of the disease.
Researchers studied the patterns of human anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010. They analyzed data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human anthrax cases during three periods: Soviet governance, post-Soviet governance, and preemptive livestock vaccination. The study found that the incidence of human anthrax increased by 11.95% from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline of 35.24% after the introduction of livestock vaccination in 1996. The researchers also observed a shift in the geographic distribution of the disease, with cases initially concentrated in the west and later shifting eastward.

The study revealed that the incidence of human cutaneous anthrax was more common in the west and south during the Soviet era, but shifted eastward towards the capital Baku in the mid-1990s. After the introduction of preemptive livestock vaccination, the disease remained primarily concentrated in eastern and northern Azerbaijan. The researchers suggest that the changes in the distribution of human anthrax highlight the need for an integrated "One Health" approach that takes into account the changing geographic distribution of the disease.

The study's findings are consistent with previous research that has documented changes in the occurrence of zoonotic diseases following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The researchers emphasize the importance of continued control measures in livestock to mitigate the occurrence of human anthrax, particularly in light of recent re-emergence of the disease in the Caucasus region.
Researchers have been studying how polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) interact with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel, a protein that helps regulate the flow of potassium ions across cell membranes. PUFAs, found in cell membrane phospholipids of heart cells and neurons, have been shown to shift the voltage dependence of the Shaker KV channel, enabling channel activation. However, the exact mechanism by which PUFAs modulate channel functioning has remained unclear.

Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, the researchers investigated the interactions between the Shaker KV channel and a PUFA-enriched lipid bilayer. They found a putative PUFA binding site in the open state of the channel, located at the protein-lipid interface near the extracellular halves of the S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain (VSD). The PUFA's lipophilic tail interacted with the hydrophobic central core of the protein-lipid interface, while its carboxylic head group interacted with polar/charged residues at the extracellular regions of the S3 and S4 helices.

The study also compared the interactions between saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and the Shaker KV channel, finding increased conformational flexibility in the polyunsaturated carbon tails compared to saturated carbon chains. This may explain the specificity of PUFA action on channel proteins. The findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of PUFA interactions with the Shaker KV channel, which could have implications for understanding the effectiveness of ketogenic diets in treating refractory epilepsy.
Researchers have developed a new screening pipeline to identify effective treatments for cryptosporidiosis, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum. This parasite is responsible for significant illness in children in developing countries and can cause life-threatening diarrhea in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with AIDS. Current treatments are often ineffective, making the discovery of new antiparasitic agents crucial.

To overcome the challenges of testing potential treatments, the researchers used a related parasite, Toxoplasma gondii, as a model to screen for inhibitors of Cryptosporidium's inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). They genetically engineered T. gondii to mimic Cryptosporidium's purine metabolism and dependence on IMPDH, allowing for a rapid and quantitative assessment of potential treatments.

The researchers developed three assays to evaluate the effectiveness of potential treatments: a host cell growth assay, a Cryptosporidium growth assay, and a high-content imaging assay. They used these assays to test a series of IMPDH inhibitors and identified two promising candidates, A103 and A110, which showed excellent potency and selectivity in the T. gondii model and improved anti-cryptosporidial activity. These compounds are more than 100 times more potent than the current standard treatment for cryptosporidiosis, paromomycin. The new screening pipeline has the potential to accelerate the development of effective treatments for this debilitating disease.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic factors influencing primary tooth development in infancy. The study analyzed data from over 6,000 individuals from two birth cohorts, the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The researchers identified five genetic loci associated with the timing of first tooth eruption and the number of teeth at one year of age. These loci were linked to several genes involved in tooth and organ development, including KCNJ2, EDA, HOXB2, RAD51L1, IGF2BP1, HMGA2, and MSRB3. Some of these genes have also been implicated in cancer development.

The study found that variants in the HOXB gene cluster were associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31. The researchers also discovered that genes at four of the identified loci are involved in the development of cancer. The study's findings provide new insights into the genetic architecture of primary tooth development and have implications for the study of other developmental and organogenic processes. The researchers suggest that the genetic factors influencing tooth development may also play a role in the development of other organs and tissues. The study's results could lead to a better understanding of the genetic basis of tooth development and potentially inform the development of new treatments for tooth-related disorders.
Researchers created two new mouse models, Ts3Yah and Ms3Yah, to study the effects of trisomy and monosomy of the Hspa13-App region on chromosome 21, which is associated with Down syndrome. This region is responsible for various physiological abnormalities, including intellectual disability, locomotor deficits, and altered muscle tone. The study found that trisomy and monosomy of the Hspa13-App region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance in mice. The expression profiling of skeletal muscles revealed changes in the regulation of genes involved in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. In Ts3Yah mice, these genes were downregulated, while in Ms3Yah mice, they were upregulated. The study also found that the shift in skeletal muscle metabolism correlates with a change in mitochondrial proliferation without an alteration in respiratory function. However, the production of reactive oxygen species from mitochondrial complex I decreased in Ms3Yah mice, while the membrane permeability of Ts3Yah mitochondria slightly increased. The results suggest that the Hspa13-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles as a consequence of changes in the dose of specific genes, including Gabpa, Nrip1, and Atp5j. The study indicates that the copy number variation in the Hspa13-App region has a peripheral impact on locomotor activity by altering muscle function.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model of the GIRK1/2 channel, a type of ion channel that plays a crucial role in regulating heartbeat and neuronal excitability. The model reveals that the channel's basal and evoked activities are controlled by the unequal stoichiometry of Gα and Gβγ subunits. This means that the ratio of Gβγ to GIRK1/2 channels is higher than the ratio of Gα to GIRK1/2 channels.

The model accurately predicts the behavior of GIRK1/2 channels in various expression systems, including Xenopus oocytes, HEK293 cells, and hippocampal neurons. It also correctly predicts the dose-dependent activation of GIRK1/2 by coexpressed Gβγ and accounts for the inverse correlation between basal and agonist-evoked activities. The model suggests that between 3 and 4 Gβγ dimers are available for each GIRK1/2 channel, while the number of available Gα subunits decreases as the density of GIRK1/2 channels increases.

The unequal association of GIRK1/2 with G protein subunits and the cooperative nature of GIRK gating by Gβγ underlie the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities. This unique mechanism allows GIRK1/2 to act as a sensitive bidirectional detector of both Gβγ and Gα. The findings of this study provide new insights into the regulation of GIRK1/2 channels and their role in neuronal excitability and plasticity.
Researchers have developed a new computational model called PrediTALE to predict the targets of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) in plants. TALEs are proteins secreted by plant-pathogenic bacteria that activate specific genes in the host plant to facilitate infection. The new model, PrediTALE, takes into account recent findings about how TALEs bind to DNA and can identify potential virulence targets more accurately than previous approaches. By analyzing RNA-seq data from infected rice plants, the researchers found that PrediTALE improved prediction performance and identified several novel putative virulence targets. However, some TALEs were not predicted to target any genes, which the researchers term "orphan TALEs." They suggest that this may be due to incomplete gene annotations and propose using genome-wide scans to identify target boxes. Using PrediTALE, the researchers were able to identify novel targets independently of existing gene annotations, including previously missing non-coding RNAs. They also demonstrated that genome-wide prediction of target boxes can recover known targets from promoterome-wide scans and identify putative targets independent of existing gene annotations. The study highlights the importance of accurate computational predictions of TALE target boxes for understanding the virulence mechanisms of plant-pathogenic bacteria.
Researchers have developed a new tool called APOGEE to assess the potential harm caused by genetic mutations in human mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA contains 24,189 possible non-synonymous amino acid changes, but only a small fraction have been thoroughly tested for their effects. Most have been evaluated using computer software, but these tools have shown inconsistent results. APOGEE is a machine-learning algorithm that outperforms existing methods in predicting the harm caused by these mutations. It was trained on a dataset of 864 known mitochondrial variants and tested on a separate set of variants. The algorithm uses a combination of features, including multi-alignments and amino acid conservation estimates, to make its predictions. APOGEE's operating logic is based on a decision tree learning model, which allows for transparent and reproducible results. The tool was designed to be easy to use and understand, making it a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians. By providing a more accurate assessment of mitochondrial DNA mutations, APOGEE has the potential to improve our understanding of the relationship between genetic mutations and disease. This is particularly important for mitochondrial DNA, which is less studied than nuclear DNA but plays a crucial role in many cellular processes. The development of APOGEE addresses a significant challenge in the field of genetics, where assessing the pathogenicity of genome mutations can be a difficult and time-consuming task.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause a range of diseases, from mild dengue fever to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome. Thrombocytopenia, or low platelet count, is a major characteristic of both mild and severe dengue disease and is linked to the progression of dengue severity. Previous studies have shown that DENV's nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) can stimulate immune cells and cause endothelial leakage, but it was unclear whether NS1 can directly activate platelets and cause thrombocytopenia.

This study found that DENV, but not Zika virus, can induce platelet activation in human platelets, which was blocked when NS1 was depleted from the DENV supernatant. Recombinant NS1 from all four DENV serotypes also activated platelets, and this effect was blocked by anti-NS1 antibodies, a TLR4 antagonist, and a TLR4 signaling inhibitor. The activation of platelets by DENV NS1 promoted platelet aggregation, adhesion to endothelial cells, and phagocytosis by macrophages.

The study also found that DENV-induced thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR4 knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 was depleted from DENV supernatant. These results suggest that the binding of DENV NS1 to TLR4 on platelets can trigger its activation, which may contribute to thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during dengue infection.
Researchers conducted a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control loops that regulate blood pressure and blood volume in the body. They focused on the interactions between three key systems: the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) system, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). The study found that these systems work together to maintain long-term homeostasis, or balance, of blood pressure and blood volume.

The researchers identified two regulatory mechanisms within the AVP-ANP-RAAS system that perform the same function, but in different ways. One mechanism affects blood pressure by regulating vasoconstriction, or the narrowing of blood vessels, while the other affects blood volume. Both mechanisms have the potential to create oscillations, or fluctuations, in the system.

The study also examined a subsystem that includes ANP and AVP stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells. This subsystem was found to be a candidate oscillator, meaning it has the potential to create oscillations. The researchers discovered that the oscillatory potential of this subsystem is higher when the delays in the feedback loops are comparable.

The study's findings provide insight into the physiological mechanisms that maintain long-term homeostasis of blood pressure and blood volume. The results suggest that these mechanisms operate through complex dynamic loops of interactions between the AVP, ANP, and RAAS systems.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism that regulates the growth of blood clots, known as thrombi. Thrombi are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and understanding how they form and grow is crucial for preventing life-threatening events. A team of scientists studied the role of fibrin networks, a component of thrombi, in regulating protein transport. They used a combination of experiments and computer simulations to investigate how proteins, such as thrombin, move through the fibrin network.

The study found that the permeability and protein diffusivity of the fibrin network are key factors in determining the transport of proteins through the network. The researchers discovered that the fibrin network, also known as the fibrin cap, limits the growth of thrombi by restricting the approach of resting platelets to the thrombus core, where thrombin is generated. This prevents platelets from becoming activated and contributing to the growth of the clot.

The study's findings suggest that the fibrin cap acts as a protective mechanism, preventing small, asymptomatic thrombi from developing into life-threatening events. The research provides new insights into the complex process of thrombus formation and growth, and highlights the importance of understanding the spatial distribution of hemostatic activators, such as thrombin, in regulating thrombogenesis. The study's results complement recent research on thrombus development and emphasize the need to consider the role of fibrin networks in regulating protein transport and thrombus growth.
Researchers investigated how a type of immune cell called invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells helps control the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They found that iNKT cells produce a protein called granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is essential for controlling Mtb growth. This is different from what was previously thought, as it was believed that iNKT cells controlled Mtb growth through the production of other proteins, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF).

The researchers discovered that iNKT cells produce GM-CSF in response to Mtb infection, and that this protein is necessary and sufficient to control Mtb growth. They also found that GM-CSF production by iNKT cells is dependent on a molecule called CD1d, which is involved in the activation of iNKT cells. In contrast, the activation of iNKT cells, as measured by the production of IFN-γ and the upregulation of a protein called CD25, is driven by other proteins produced by infected macrophages, such as IL-12 and IL-18.

These findings suggest that the conventional markers of iNKT cell activation, such as CD25 and IFN-γ production, are not reliable indicators of the cell's ability to control Mtb growth. Instead, the production of GM-CSF by iNKT cells is a key factor in controlling Mtb growth, and may play a role in T cell immunity against the bacterium.
Researchers studied how the fungus Candida albicans, a common inhabitant of the human gut, regulates its population size during colonization. They found that the EFH1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in controlling the number of C. albicans cells in the gut. When the EFH1 gene is deleted, the fungus grows more abundantly in the gut, while overexpressing the gene leads to reduced colonization. This suggests that EFH1 helps to regulate the balance between commensalism, where the fungus coexists with the host, and candidiasis, a condition where the fungus causes disease. The researchers also found that EFH1 does not affect the fungus's ability to cause disease when it enters the bloodstream, but rather influences its ability to colonize the gut and oral cavity. The study highlights the importance of understanding how C. albicans regulates its population size in different environments, as this can impact its ability to cause disease. The findings suggest that EFH1 is a key regulator of C. albicans colonization in the gut, and that its expression can influence the balance between commensalism and candidiasis. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex interactions between C. albicans and its host, and has implications for understanding the development of candidiasis.
Immunization with irradiated malaria sporozoites is currently the most effective way to protect against liver stages of the malaria parasite. However, the reasons behind its success are not well understood. Researchers have found that for CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a key role in fighting malaria, to develop a strong response, they need to be exposed to the parasite's antigens for a prolonged period of time. This is surprising because the irradiated sporozoites, which are used in the immunization, are unable to replicate and do not progress beyond the early stages of infection. Despite this, the parasite's antigens persist in the body for over 8 weeks after immunization. This persistence is dependent on the presence of CD11c+ cells, which are a type of immune cell that helps to present antigens to other immune cells. The researchers found that prolonged antigen presentation enhances the CD8+ T cell response in several ways. Firstly, reducing the time that primed CD8+ T cells are exposed to antigen in the body severely reduces the size of the developing memory population. Secondly, fully developed memory cells expand in previously immunized mice but not when transferred to naive animals. Finally, persisting antigen is able to prime naive cells, including recent thymic emigrants, to become functional effector cells capable of eliminating parasites in the liver. These findings suggest that the optimal development of protective CD8+ T cell immunity against malaria liver stages is dependent on the prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen.
Researchers have developed a new way to deliver a drug called polymyxin B (polB) to treat leishmaniasis, a disease caused by a parasite that can lead to disfiguring skin lesions. The new delivery system uses tiny particles called nanocarriers that are coated with polB. These nanocarriers, called PBCAnp-polB, are designed to release the polB slowly over time, allowing for a prolonged and effective treatment. The researchers tested the effectiveness of PBCAnp-polB against Leishmania amazonensis, a type of parasite that causes leishmaniasis. They found that the nanocarriers were able to kill the parasites more effectively than free polB, with an IC50 value of 6.0 μg/mL. This is a significant improvement over the IC50 value of 77.1 μg/mL for free polB. The researchers also found that the nanocarriers had antimicrobial properties, which could help prevent secondary infections that often accompany leishmaniasis. The PBCAnp-polB system showed no toxicity to macrophages, the cells that the parasite infects, and was stable for at least 45 days. The researchers believe that this new delivery system could provide a more effective and safer treatment for leishmaniasis, and could also be used to prevent secondary infections.
A study in Brazil investigated the factors associated with death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania infantum. The researchers analyzed data from the Brazilian Ministry of Health's Reportable Disease Information System (SINAN) for the period 2002-2009. They found that several clinical manifestations were associated with a higher risk of death from VL, including weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, age 60 years or older, bleeding, other associated infections, and jaundice. These findings are consistent with previous studies that identified age, jaundice, bleeding, and co-morbidities as risk factors for death from VL.

The researchers developed a prognostic score using the variables associated with death from VL in the latest version of SINAN. The score had a sensitivity of 71.4%, specificity of 73.7%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 75.6%. This suggests that the score can be a useful tool for predicting the likelihood of death from VL.

Visceral leishmaniasis is a significant public health problem, with an estimated 500,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide each year. The disease is particularly prevalent in six countries, including Brazil, where the study was conducted. Understanding the factors associated with death from VL can help improve clinical management of patients and reduce mortality.
Researchers studied the regulatory receptor-like kinase BAK1 in plants, which plays a crucial role in perceiving and integrating external and internal stimuli. They found that a novel allele of BAK1, called bak1-5, differentially regulates three signaling pathways: plant growth, cell death, and innate immunity. The study showed that bak1-5 mutants are severely impaired in innate immune signaling mediated by the BAK1-dependent receptors FLS2 and EFR, but not in steroid hormone responses or cell death control. In contrast to the RD kinase BRI1, the non-RD kinases FLS2 and EFR have low kinase activity and are unable to trans-phosphorylate BAK1 in vitro. The study also found that kinase activity is not required for the ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS2 or EFR with BAK1 in planta. However, the specific suppression of FLS2- and EFR-dependent signaling in bak1-5 requires BAK1-5 kinase activity. The results demonstrate a phosphorylation-dependent differential control of plant growth, innate immunity, and cell death by BAK1, revealing key differences in the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of ligand-binding RD and non-RD receptors. The study highlights the importance of BAK1 in plant innate immunity and suggests that its function in cell death control and innate immunity is independent of its function in BR signaling.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cancer cells respond to treatment. Current methods can't capture the complexity of how cancer cells react to treatment over multiple cell generations. The new approach combines time-lapse live cell microscopy and flow cytometric data to create a computer model of the cell cycle and subsequent generations during and after treatment. The model includes modules that describe the main pathways causing cell arrest, repair, and death in each phase of the cell cycle. This framework allows researchers to apply different types of modules in each phase and test models at various levels of complexity.

The method was tested using X-ray-treated human ovarian cancer cells at different doses. The model was built by combining modules with a rational strategy and fitting simultaneously all data from different doses and platforms. The final model provided a complete rendering of the cell cycle process following X-ray exposure, giving separate and quantitative measures of the dose-dependence of G1, S, and G2/M checkpoint activities in subsequent generations. This model reconciles known effects of ionizing radiation and provides new insights into the response of cancer cells to treatment. The method enables a detailed study of the mechanisms contributing to the response to anticancer treatment at the cell population level, accounting for inter-cell variability.
Researchers studied mice with a genetic mutation in the Pdss2 gene, which is involved in the production of coenzyme Q (CoQ), an essential molecule for energy production in cells. They found that mice with this mutation developed a kidney disease characterized by damage to the glomerular podocytes, which are crucial for filtering waste and excess fluids from the blood. The researchers discovered that the kidney disease was caused by a deficiency of CoQ in the podocytes, leading to impaired energy production and cellular damage. They also found that the disease was not caused by an inflammatory response, but rather by the accumulation of cellular debris.

The study showed that mice with the Pdss2 mutation had significantly lower levels of CoQ9 and CoQ10 in their kidneys compared to healthy mice. Additionally, the researchers found that knocking out the Pdss2 gene specifically in podocytes resulted in a more severe kidney disease phenotype than mice with the Pdss2 mutation. This suggests that the mutation in the Pdss2 gene has some residual activity, but it is not enough to prevent the development of kidney disease.

The study provides new insights into the relationship between CoQ deficiency and kidney disease, and highlights the importance of CoQ in maintaining the health of glomerular podocytes. The findings also suggest that CoQ deficiency may be a contributing factor to the development of kidney disease in humans, particularly in individuals with mutations in the Pdss2 gene.
Researchers have found that the developmental cell lineages of certain organisms are surprisingly resilient to cell death and other disturbances. These cell lineages, which determine the fate of cells during development, are found in two types of animals called protostomes and one type called deuterostomes. Despite cell deaths, the overall composition of the organisms remains relatively unchanged. This robustness is attributed to several features of the cell lineages, including their simplicity, topology, and the early appearance of rare cells. Most cell types in these lineages are not clonal, meaning they do not come from a single cell, which also contributes to their robustness. Simulations of cell lineage evolution suggest that this robustness may have evolved as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. This discovery reveals a new mechanism of phenotypic robustness, which is a key characteristic of life. Unlike other mechanisms of robustness, which occur at the cellular or subcellular level, cell lineage robustness occurs at the level of the entire organism. This mechanism is particularly important for species with determinative development, where cell fate is largely fixed. The study also provides a new explanation for how development contributes to phenotypic robustness and suggests that cell lineage robustness, along with other mechanisms, forms a multi-layer defense system against environmental and genetic disturbances.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput platform called EmbryoPhenomics to study the development of aquatic embryos. This platform consists of an open-source video microscope called OpenVIM and a Python package called Embryo Computer Vision (EmbryoCV). OpenVIM captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled environmental conditions, while EmbryoCV analyzes the videos to extract data on morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits.

The platform was tested on over 30 million images of more than 600 embryos from two species, the pond snail Radix balthica and the marine amphipod Orchestia gammarellus. The results showed that EmbryoCV successfully extracted phenome-level data from 95% of the images, providing high-dimensional data on embryo responses to environmental changes such as temperature and salinity.

EmbryoPhenomics can acquire and process data on functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest stages of life, making it a valuable tool for studying development and phenomics. The platform is versatile and can be applied to a range of experimental designs, from short-term to long-term experiments. The data generated by EmbryoPhenomics is comparable in scale, diversity, and quality to that produced by molecular-omic technologies, making it a powerful tool for understanding complex organismal responses to environmental change.
Malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium spp., undergo significant changes in their metabolism as they transition between different stages of their life cycle in the mosquito and human hosts. Researchers have used stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to study the metabolic changes in Plasmodium berghei, a rodent malaria parasite. The study found that the parasite's metabolism shifts from a glycolytic metabolism in the asexual blood stages to a dependence on the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle in the mosquito stages.

The researchers discovered that glutamine serves as the primary input into the TCA cycle in both asexual and sexual blood stages, and is essential for complete male gametogenesis. Additionally, glutamine catabolism and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are crucial for the transition from ookinete to oocyst in the mosquito. These findings provide new insights into Plasmodium metabolism and suggest potential targets for transmission-blocking intervention strategies.

The study also highlights significant metabolic differences between Plasmodium species, which are not easily anticipated based on genomic or transcriptomic studies. The researchers used a combination of metabolomic and reverse genetic approaches to investigate the metabolic changes in key insect stages of P. berghei and the potential impact of these changes on parasite infection in the mosquito. The study's findings have implications for the development of new treatments and highlight the importance of integrating metabolomics data with other platforms to inform drug discovery and design.
Biologists have long known that cells can differentiate between different types of signals, such as pulsatile and sustained signals, to regulate gene expression. A common motif in these signaling pathways is the incoherent feedforward loop (IFFL), where an input simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output. This motif can exhibit temporal adaptation, allowing the system to become desensitized to sustained inputs. Researchers used quantitative modeling to examine another property of IFFLs: their ability to process oscillatory signals. They found that the system's ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints: the kinetics of the IFFL components and a match between the network parameters and input signal characteristics. The study suggests that IFFLs can "count" the number of pulses in an oscillatory signal, but only if the network parameters and input signal characteristics are well-matched. The researchers also identified the dynamic constraints of the input signals and network parameters necessary for counting to occur. This work has implications for understanding how natural biological networks process oscillatory signals and designing synthetic gene circuits for this purpose. The study highlights the importance of IFFLs in decoding oscillatory signals, which are common in biological systems, and provides insights into the mechanisms underlying this process.
Researchers have developed improved methods for quantifying, propagating, purifying, and storing Orientia tsutsugamushi, the bacterium responsible for scrub typhus, a leading cause of serious febrile illness in rural Southeast Asia. The bacterium is an obligate intracellular pathogen that can only be cultured in mammalian cells, making it difficult to study. To address this challenge, the researchers created a standardized method for comparing the viability of O. tsutsugamushi after purification, treatment, and propagation under various conditions. They used a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to measure bacterial growth and developed a simplified growth assay to compare the growth of the organism across different conditions. The researchers also established a method for quantifying O. tsutsugamushi levels by extracting total DNA and measuring the exact genome copy number using a specific primer/probe set. These improved methods will be useful for researchers studying O. tsutsugamushi and other obligate intracellular pathogens, such as those in the Rickettsiales and Chlamydiales families. The findings will also aid in improving clinical isolation rates and performing in vitro cell biology experiments. The research aims to support future studies on the fundamental mechanisms of cellular infection by O. tsutsugamushi, which has been hindered by the technical difficulties associated with culturing the bacterium in vitro.
Researchers investigated the safety and effectiveness of the antihelminthic drug praziquantel (PZQ) in treating schistosomiasis in children aged 1-5 years. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the Schistosoma haematobium worm, which can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Currently, children under 5 years old are excluded from schistosomiasis control programs due to a lack of data on the safety of PZQ in this age group.

The study involved 104 children aged 1-5 years from Zimbabwe, who were treated with PZQ tablets and monitored for side effects. Within 24 hours of treatment, 3.8% of the children reported side effects, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation of the face and body. However, these side effects were mild and temporary.

The study found that PZQ treatment significantly reduced schistosome infection levels in the children, with an egg reduction rate of 99% and a cure rate of 92%. This is comparable to the effectiveness of PZQ in older children aged 6-10 years. The researchers conclude that PZQ is safe and effective in treating schistosomiasis in children as young as 1-5 years old, and should be included in schistosomiasis control programs for this age group.
Researchers used fruit flies (Drosophila) to identify new genes involved in cancer development. They found that mutations in the Ras gene contribute to about 30% of human cancers, but are not enough on their own to cause cancer. To find other genes that work with Ras to cause cancer, the researchers used a high-throughput screening method in Drosophila to test thousands of genes for their role in cancer development. This method allowed them to identify multiple new genes that are involved in cancer development and are conserved across species, meaning they are also found in humans.

The researchers found that many of these genes were downregulated (expressed at lower levels) in human tumors, suggesting that they may be tumor suppressors. They validated the top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes in secondary Drosophila assays and found that low expression of these genes was associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. One of the top hits, Tetraspanin 29Fb, was further studied and found to regulate the EGFR signaling pathway, epithelial architecture, and restrain tumor growth and invasion.

This study provides a starting point for identifying new genes and pathways involved in tumor suppression and metastasis of Ras-driven epithelial cancers. The findings suggest that Tetraspanin 29Fb is a key regulator of EGFR/Ras-induced epithelial tumor growth and invasion, and may be a potential target for cancer therapy. The use of Drosophila as a model organism allowed the researchers to genetically dissect cancer-relevant signaling networks in a whole animal, leading to the identification of novel biomarkers and potential new drug targets for a range of epithelial tumors.
Researchers have discovered a new gene, wtf13, in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe that acts as a meiotic driver. Meiotic drivers are genes that manipulate the reproductive process to increase their own transmission to offspring, often at a cost to the rest of the genome. Wtf13 achieves this by producing a poison that kills spores that do not inherit it, while also producing an antidote that rescues spores that do inherit it. However, another gene, wtf18-2, has been found to suppress the drive of wtf13 by mimicking the antidote produced by wtf13. This means that wtf18-2 only rescues spores that inherit it, allowing it to selfishly gain a transmission advantage while reducing the drive of wtf13. This discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms and evolution of meiotic drive systems. The researchers suggest that wtf18-2 may have evolved from an ancestral gene that was a dual-transcript poison-antidote meiotic driver, and that novel duplications of this ancestral gene could have been selected for their ability to cause drive and protect spores from the poison of the ancestral driver. This study contributes to our understanding of the complex interactions between meiotic drivers and their suppressors, and has implications for our understanding of the evolution of selfish genetic elements.
Researchers have developed an algorithm that can predict gene expression differences among human individuals using only their genetic information. The algorithm uses data from multiple genetic variants in the vicinity of the predicted gene to make accurate predictions. Notably, the predictions are robust and consistent across different populations, even when the training and test sets consist of individuals from distinct populations. This means that the algorithm can accurately predict gene expression in individuals from different ethnic or geographic backgrounds.

The algorithm uses a combination of genetic variants and their proximity to the predicted gene to make predictions. It also incorporates heterogeneous types of genomic annotations to weigh the importance of different genetic variants. By assigning higher weights to variants with specific annotations, such as proximity to genes or high regional G/C content, the algorithm can improve its predictions.

The researchers found that genes that are successfully predicted by the algorithm tend to have higher expression levels and more variability across individuals. This suggests that the algorithm is able to identify genes that are more sensitive to genetic variation. The algorithm's ability to predict gene expression differences among individuals could have important implications for understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases and phenotypes. By identifying genes that are sensitive to genetic variation, researchers may be able to develop new treatments or therapies that target these genes.
Researchers studied how different strains of the malaria parasite compete with each other in the body. They used a mathematical model to analyze data from experiments where two strains of the parasite, one virulent and one avirulent, were introduced into mice. The study found that the virulent strain suppressed the growth of the avirulent strain, a phenomenon known as competitive suppression. The researchers tested several possible explanations for this suppression, including differences in how the parasites infect red blood cells, how the immune system clears the parasites, and how the parasites interact with each other. They found that the key factor was the rate at which the parasites are cleared by the immune system, specifically the ratio of the rate at which the parasites are cleared to the rate at which they infect new red blood cells. This ratio was different for the two strains in mixed infections, but not in single-strain infections. The study suggests that the innate immune response, which is the body's first line of defense against infection, plays a key role in competitive suppression. The researchers also found that the suppression occurs early in the infection, even before the parasite numbers reach their peak. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between different strains of the malaria parasite and the immune system, and has implications for understanding the evolution of virulence and drug resistance in malaria.
Researchers have proposed a new model, called Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIRA), to explain how certain types of genetic errors occur during DNA replication. These errors, known as interstitial inverted triplications, can lead to changes in the number of copies of specific DNA sequences, which can have significant effects on an organism's health and evolution. The ODIRA model suggests that a replication error at short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences creates an extrachromosomal, inverted dimeric, autonomously replicating intermediate. This intermediate can then integrate into the genome, resulting in an inverted triplication without losing distal chromosomal sequences.

The researchers tested the ODIRA model using a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that the proposed replication error, which involves the ligation of leading and lagging nascent strands to create "closed" forks, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted inverted repeats. They also showed that the resulting hairpin-capped linear duplex can replicate in vivo to create an inverted, dimeric plasmid that integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication.

The ODIRA model can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons that have a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent. This is a feature that other models cannot explain. The researchers' tests of key features of ODIRA lend support to this mechanism and suggest further avenues of enquiry to unravel the origins of interstitial, inverted copy number variations pivotal in human health and evolution.
Researchers studied how the influenza virus affects the way cells translate genetic information into proteins. They found that when cells are infected with the virus, translation initiation - the process of starting protein synthesis - can occur at non-canonical start codons, which are different from the usual start codon. This can lead to the production of novel immune epitopes, which are parts of proteins that can trigger an immune response.

The study used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to investigate translation initiation in human lung epithelial cells infected with the influenza virus. They found that while there is selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in influenza virus lineages that have adapted to mammalian hosts, they did not detect globally higher levels of alternate translation initiation on host transcripts upon infection.

However, they did identify several candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs, including one that results in a truncated version of the N1 neuraminidase protein. This truncated protein is expressed on the cell surface during infection, is enzymatically active, and is conserved in most N1 viral lineages. The study also found that the subset of host transcripts induced by the anti-viral response is enriched for alternate initiation sites. Overall, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of translation initiation during influenza virus infection and sheds light on the evolutionary forces shaping this process.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), cause foodborne disease, resulting in a significant economic and health burden. EHEC can lead to severe bloody diarrhea and potentially fatal kidney disease (hemolytic uremic syndrome) for which there is no effective treatment or prevention. To cause disease, EHEC uses a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells. These effectors subvert host cell function to promote diarrheal disease and bacterial transmission. However, the mechanisms by which these effectors bind to host proteins and disrupt normal intestinal epithelial cell function are not fully understood.

Researchers have identified two E. coli O157:H7 genes, nleH1 and nleH2, which encode T3SS effectors that bind to the human ribosomal protein S3 (RPS3), a subunit of the NF-κB transcriptional complex. The N-terminal region of both NleH1 and NleH2 is required for binding to the N-terminus of RPS3. NleH1 and NleH2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr protein kinases, but their binding to RPS3 is independent of kinase activity. NleH1, but not NleH2, reduces the nuclear abundance of RPS3 without altering the p50 or p65 NF-κB subunits or affecting the phosphorylation state or abundance of the inhibitory NF-κB chaperone IκBα. NleH1 represses the transcription of a RPS3/NF-κB-dependent reporter plasmid, while NleH2 stimulates RPS3-dependent transcription. A region of NleH1 (N40-K45) is responsible for the inhibitory activity of NleH1 toward RPS3. Deleting nleH1 from E. coli O157:H7 produces a hypervirulent phenotype in a gnotobiotic piglet model of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli infection.
Researchers have developed a new approach to understanding how proteins bind to DNA, a fundamental process in gene regulation. The current method used to represent protein-DNA interactions, called position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), assumes that each position on the DNA sequence is independent of the others. However, this simplification does not hold true in many cases. The new approach, called feature motif models (FMMs), uses log-linear models to represent protein-DNA interactions, allowing for dependencies between binding positions. FMMs use sequence features, such as palindromes, to describe the binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs).

The researchers developed an algorithm to learn the structural features of FMMs from binding site data and a discriminative motif finder to discover new FMMs that are enriched in target sequences compared to background sequences. They evaluated their approach on synthetic data and a widely used dataset of TF chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) data. The results showed that FMMs explain TF binding significantly better than PSSMs.

The researchers applied their approach to high-throughput TF ChIP data from mouse and human and revealed sequence features that are present in the binding specificities of mouse and human TFs. They also showed that FMMs learn the binding specificities of TFs better than PSSMs. The FMM learning and motif finder software are available online. This new approach has the potential to improve our understanding of gene regulation and may be integrated into existing motif finding algorithms.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees by studying the adrenergic α2C receptor (ADRA2C) gene. They found that humans and chimpanzees have lower expression of ADRA2C compared to other primates. By analyzing three-dimensional chromatin structure, the team identified a specific region that regulates ADRA2C expression. This region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF) binding motifs, each with a polymorphism. The derived alleles of these polymorphisms have reached fixation in humans and chimpanzees, but not in bonobos or macaques.

The researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and reporter assays to show that the derived nucleotides repress ADRA2C expression by increasing NRSF binding. They also detected signatures of recent positive selection for lower neuronal ADRA2C expression in humans. The study suggests that there has been selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in the evolution of humans and chimpanzees.

The team examined various types of data, including transcriptomic, epigenomic, and population genomic data, to identify regulatory variants responsible for human- and chimpanzee-specific repression of ADRA2C. They found that two variants, DHS2.v2 and DHS2, may have arisen recently and reached near-fixation in humans and chimpanzees. The researchers also identified a topologically associating domain (TAD) that harbors ADRA2C and contains 12 DNAse hypersensitive sites (DHSs) connected to the ADRA2C promoter. The derived sequences at these sites are fixed or near-fixed in the present-day human population.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the C4 photosynthetic pathway, a complex trait that allows plants to increase their productivity by up to 50% in tropical and subtropical areas. This pathway has evolved independently at least 60 times across different plant lineages, including both monocotyledons and dicotyledons. To understand how these separate lineages use the same genetic networks to maintain C4 photosynthesis, researchers developed a new informatics framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. They applied this framework to two independent C4 lineages, Cleome gynandra and Zea mays, whose last common ancestor diverged 140 million years ago. The study identified a cohort of 3,335 genes that represent conserved components of leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. The researchers found that genes encoding proteins of the C4 cycle are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes, and that homologous transcription factors are used to induce C4 photosynthesis and maintain cell-specific gene expression in both species. This suggests that parallel evolution of trans-factors underpins the repeated appearance of C4 photosynthesis. The study also identified a core molecular signature associated with leaf and photosynthetic maturation that is likely shared by angiosperm species derived from the last common ancestor of the monocotyledons and dicotyledons. The findings have implications for engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops such as rice.
Researchers studied a healthcare worker infected with the Ebola virus (EBOV) in Sierra Leone to better understand how the virus behaves in the body. They collected samples from the patient's upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as from their plasma, over several days. The team found that even after the virus had cleared from the patient's plasma, viral RNA was still present in the lower respiratory tract. This suggests that the virus may be replicating locally in the lungs, rather than just lingering in the respiratory tract due to the stability of the RNA. The presence of both positive and negative sense RNA in the respiratory tract, but not in the plasma, supports this idea. The study's findings are consistent with previous research that found viral antigens and nucleic acids in lung tissues of patients who died from EBOV infection. The study's results have implications for understanding how EBOV is transmitted from person to person and for developing effective intervention strategies. However, further investigation is needed to fully understand the clinical significance of viral replication and shedding in the respiratory tract. The study provides new insights into the biology of EBOV and highlights the importance of studying the virus in different body compartments to develop effective countermeasures.
Researchers studied the Machupo virus (MACV), a New World arenavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, and the Junin virus (JUNV), which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever. They created a recombinant virus, rMACV/Cd#1-GPC, that expresses the glycoprotein from the Candid#1 (Cd#1) vaccine strain of JUNV. This virus was found to be completely attenuated in a murine model and protected animals from lethal challenge with MACV. However, a single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the glycoprotein was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUNV. To investigate the role of different domains of the glycoprotein in attenuation, the researchers created several rMACVs that expressed the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC either alone, with the TMD F438I substitution, or with the TMD of Cd#1. The results showed that the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC contributed to the attenuation of rMACV/Cd#1-GPC, but the ectodomain alone was not sufficient for complete attenuation. The researchers also found that mice infected with the rMACV expressing the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC had reduced lethality and produced neutralizing antibodies against Cd#1. Overall, the study suggests that the ectodomain of Cd#1 GPC plays a crucial role in the attenuation and immunogenicity of rMACV/Cd#1-GPC.
Researchers have discovered that specific point mutations in the centromeric histone 3 (CENH3) protein can cause post-zygotic incompatibility and uniparental inheritance in plants. CENH3 is essential for the proper segregation of sister chromatids during cell division. By introducing single amino acid changes in the histone fold domain of CENH3 in Arabidopsis plants, the researchers found that many of the mutant lines displayed normal growth and fertility when self-pollinated, but exhibited frequent post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. This phenomenon is similar to the genome elimination syndromes observed in chimeric CENH3 and CENH3 from diverged species.

The study suggests that a single point mutation in the histone fold domain of CENH3 is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, which can be used to identify non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized collections of crop species. The researchers identified an Arabidopsis line carrying the A86V substitution in the histone fold domain, which produced post-zygotic death and uniparental haploids when crossed with wild-type plants. The study also found that centromeres determined by point mutations in CENH3 specify efficient chromosome inheritance in self-crosses, but lead to missegregation in F1 hybrids when confronted with centromeres determined by the wild-type CENH3.
Researchers have explored the role of alternative splicing in the development of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. Alternative splicing is a process by which a single gene can produce multiple proteins with different functions. To study this process, the researchers modified a line of hESCs to allow for the selection of pluripotent cells and cardiac precursors. They analyzed the expression of genes in these cells and identified specific patterns of alternative splicing associated with cardiac and neural differentiation.

The study found that alternative splicing plays a crucial role in the development of cardiac precursors, influencing pathways such as cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control. The researchers also identified novel changes in protein domain and microRNA binding site architecture that affect protein function and expression. These changes included the enrichment of splice isoforms that promote calcium signaling and cardiac development in cardiac precursors.

The study suggests that alternative splicing may influence lineage commitment and hESC maintenance at the level of specific splice isoforms and microRNA regulation. The researchers identified several genes that undergo alternative splicing during differentiation, including those involved in calcium signaling, cell metabolism, cell cycle, and double-stranded RNA binding. The study provides new insights into the role of alternative splicing in the development of cardiac precursors and offers potential targets for driving the expression of pluripotent cells to distinct lineages and inducing pluripotency from adult cells.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) as a potential target for developing antimicrobials against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. T6P is a key molecule in the trehalose biosynthesis pathway, which is essential for the growth and survival of M. tuberculosis. The researchers created a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis that allowed them to regulate the expression of the T6P phosphatase gene, otsB2. They found that otsB2 is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in the lab and during the acute infection phase in mice, but not during the chronic infection phase. This suggests that M. tuberculosis remodels its trehalose metabolism during infection. The researchers discovered that blocking otsB2 leads to the accumulation of T6P, which is toxic to the cells and causes self-poisoning. They also found that blocking T6P production in a mutant lacking the T6P synthase gene, otsA, abolished the essentiality of otsB2. Furthermore, they identified over 800 genes that are upregulated in response to T6P accumulation, which may be due to an increase in RNA stability. The researchers also identified potential drug targets that could be used in combination with otsB2 inhibitors to combat M. tuberculosis.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating Chagas' disease, a life-threatening illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease affects 11-18 million people and current treatments have poor efficacy and safety profiles. A key enzyme called Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TcPR) has been found to play a crucial role in the parasite's ability to evade the host's immune system. TcPR undergoes large-scale conformational changes when binding to its substrate, which exposes critical residues that trigger a mitogenic B-cell response. This response contributes to the parasite's persistence and ability to evade the immune system.

To study these conformational changes, researchers used advanced molecular dynamics simulations to extend the effective simulation time and capture large-scale motions of functional relevance. The results revealed potential conformational epitopes located in the vicinity of newly identified transient binding pockets. These findings provide new insights into the function of TcPR and its role in the mitogenic B-cell response. The study suggests that targeting TcPR could be a promising approach for developing new treatments for Chagas' disease.

The researchers used a combination of molecular dynamics simulations, sequence conservation, and small molecule fragment mapping analyses to identify the conformational states of TcPR. Their results indicate that the mitogenic properties of TcPR are associated with the exposure of conserved conformational epitopes located around previously unidentified binding pockets. The study provides a model for the open form of TcPR and sheds light on the molecular basis behind the mitogenic B-cell response of TcPR, paving the way for future structure-based drug discovery.
Researchers have developed a new method for controlling gene expression in mice, allowing for the reversible and inducible knockout of specific genes. This system, called iKO, enables scientists to turn genes on and off at will by treating the mice with doxycycline. The iKO system consists of two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout (KO) line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous target gene, and a line with a tetracycline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. This allows for low basal expression and high inducibility of the target gene.

The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of the iKO system by creating mice with inducible knockout of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, which is involved in cholesterol metabolism. The results showed that the ApoE gene could be turned on and off in response to doxycycline treatment, leading to changes in plasma cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system has several advantages over existing methods, including reversibility, high efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. It also allows for high-throughput production of iKO mice and can be easily adapted to a wide range of applications. The researchers believe that the iKO system will be a valuable tool for studying gene function and developing new treatments for human diseases.
Researchers studied how the placenta responds to infection by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy. They infected mice with two different strains of the parasite, K98 and VD, and analyzed the genetic response of the placenta using a technique called microarray analysis. The study found that the placenta responds differently to the two strains, with some genes being up-regulated (increased activity) and others being down-regulated (decreased activity) in response to infection.

The researchers found that the "Secretory Granule" pathway was down-regulated in both infected groups, while the "Innate Immune Response" and "Response to Interferon-gamma" pathways were up-regulated in the VD-infected group but not in the K98-infected group. They also found that metabolic processes, transcription, and macromolecular transport were down-regulated in infected placentas, while some pathways related to signaling were up-regulated in the VD group but down-regulated in the K98 group.

The study suggests that the placenta mounts a strong immune response to the parasite, but this response is dependent on the genotype of the parasite. The VD strain, which was isolated from a human case of congenital infection, showed a stronger tropism (tendency to infect) to the placental organ than the K98 strain. The study provides new insights into the genetic response of the placenta to T. cruzi infection and may contribute to the development of strategies to prevent congenital transmission of the parasite.
Researchers studied the prevalence of Sindbis virus (SINV) in mosquito vectors in central Sweden to identify an objective signal for outbreaks of the virus, which causes polyarthritis and rash, known as Ockelbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta disease in Finland. They collected mosquitoes from the River Dalälven floodplains in 2000-2003 and found that SINV was detectable in mosquitoes from July 30 to September 10. The study revealed a significant increase in SINV prevalence in both enzootic and bridge-vector mosquitoes in 2002, with 15 strains recovered compared to only one in 2001 and four in 2003. Sequence analysis showed that all isolates belonged to the SINV genotype I (SINV-I) and revealed local maintenance of four SINV-I clades in the River Dalälven floodplains over the years. The findings suggest that increased SINV-I prevalence in vector mosquitoes is a valuable outbreak marker for further investigation of the hypothesized seven-year cycle of SINV-I outbreaks. The study provides the first objective markers for SINV polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe. The results also indicate that SINV-I has a diverse range of strains present in the mosquito population of the River Dalälven floodplains, with many strains occurring at multiple sites and several strains occurring at one site.
Researchers studied how the locust's sense of smell is processed in the brain, specifically in the mushroom body, a region associated with memory. They found that when a locust is presented with an odor, only a few neurons in the mushroom body, called Kenyon cells, respond specifically to that smell. Different odors trigger responses in different Kenyon cells. To understand how this specificity is achieved, the researchers used a computer model to simulate the neural connections between the antennal lobe and the mushroom body. They found that a type of brain plasticity, or learning and memory, plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the connections between these two brain regions. This plasticity allows the locust's brain to selectively filter out irrelevant information and focus on the important details of the odor. The model suggests that this type of plasticity is essential for creating a sparse representation of the odor in the mushroom body, which is necessary for memory and learning. The researchers' findings are consistent with previous studies on the locust's olfactory system and suggest that this type of plasticity may be a general mechanism used by the brain to process sensory information across different species. The study provides new insights into how the brain processes sensory information and makes predictions about the role of synaptic plasticity in this process.
Researchers conducted the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene Expression (STAGE) study to identify genes associated with the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). They analyzed gene expression profiles from five tissues, including the liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, atherosclerotic arterial wall, and unaffected arterial wall, from 278 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. The study found 60 tissue clusters, with two clusters in the atherosclerotic arterial wall and visceral fat that segregated patients into two groups based on the extent of coronary stenosis. These clusters were validated by analyzing carotid atherosclerosis expression profiles.

The researchers identified a group of 128 genes, referred to as the atherosclerosis module (A-module), that were strongly associated with atherosclerosis severity. The A-module was found to be enriched with genetic risk for CAD and involved the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TEML) pathway. The A-module was active in both atherosclerotic arterial wall and visceral fat, suggesting that it may play a key role in the development of CAD. The study also identified the transcription co-factor LIM domain binding 2 (LDB2) as a potential high-hierarchy regulator of the A-module, which was supported by subnetwork analysis, cellular and lesion expression of LDB2, and the expression of 13 TEML genes in Ldb2-deficient arterial wall. The findings suggest that the A-module and LDB2 may be important for atherosclerosis development and warrant further investigation in CAD research.
Researchers have made a breakthrough in understanding the circadian clock of cyanobacteria, specifically the Synechococcus model organism. They discovered a two-loop transcriptional feedback mechanism involving the KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock. KaiC undergoes different phospho-states during the day, but it was unclear which state promotes or suppresses the expression of its own gene, kaiBC. By analyzing various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional feedback regulation, the researchers developed a model that accurately reproduces existing experimental observations. They found that threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kaiBC transcription, while unphosphorylated KaiC hexamers suppress it. This two-loop feedback mechanism suggests that the peak expression ratio of the positive and negative components of kaiBC expression is key to how the circadian clock responds to changes in the kai genes. The researchers' model, called the TTFL/PTO model, could help explain how the KaiC protein controls hundreds of rhythmically regulated genes in the cyanobacterial genome. The findings have parallels with two-loop feedback structures found in the mammalian clock. The study provides new insights into the regulation of the cyanobacterial circadian clock and could have implications for understanding circadian rhythms in other organisms, including humans.
A recent study investigated the characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs in individuals with a poorly productive HIV-2 infection and slow or absent disease progression. The researchers found that HIV-2 reservoirs differ from those of HIV-1 in two key ways. Firstly, HIV-2 does not infect monocytes, unlike HIV-1, suggesting that HIV-2 is poorly adapted to the myeloid compartment. Secondly, HIV-2 primarily infects transitional-memory CD4 T-cells (TTM) rather than central-memory CD4 T-cells (TCM), which are the main reservoir for HIV-1. This difference in infection patterns is associated with the expression of the CXCR6 co-receptor and restriction factors, such as TRIM5, which are more abundant in TTM cells than in TCM cells. The study suggests that HIV-2 may be less adapted to human central-memory CD4 T-cells than to transitional-memory ones. The findings provide new insights into the low pathogenicity of HIV-2 infection and shed light on the mechanisms underlying its attenuated replication. The study's results are consistent with those from other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infection, such as the sooty-mangabey model, where TCM reservoirs are limited due to low CCR5 co-receptor expression. Overall, the study highlights the unique characteristics of HIV-2 reservoirs and their implications for understanding the virus's low pathogenicity.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) to explain how selective attention works in the brain. The model describes how attention affects the activity and selectivity of neurons in the cortex, which is the outer layer of the brain responsible for processing sensory information. Unlike previous models, ARC is implemented in spiking neurons, which are the basic units of the brain's electrical activity, and maps the computations for selective attention to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry.

The ARC model predicts that spatial attention only affects neural spatial selectivity, without altering selectivity for other feature dimensions. It also suggests that the different forms of attentional modulation are consequences of a single mechanism for selective attentional routing. The model is tested by simulating three studies of attention in macaque monkeys and is shown to quantitatively match several observed forms of attentional modulation.

The ARC model makes several predictions, including that an increasing proportion of neurons at each higher cortical level will show attentional modulation, and that the magnitude of modulation will increase in higher cortical areas. These predictions are based on a functional mechanism for attentional routing in a large-scale hierarchical model, which is biologically plausible and accounts for five forms of attentional effect. Overall, the ARC model provides a unified explanation of selective attentional processing in the cortex and makes several specific and quantifiable predictions that can be tested experimentally.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study to investigate the genetic factors contributing to atrial fibrillation (AF), a common and heritable arrhythmia. They analyzed whole exome sequencing data from 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from four population-based cohorts. The study aimed to identify coding genetic variants associated with AF susceptibility. After adjusting for multiple testing, none of the 99,404 common variants evaluated were significantly associated with AF. However, a common missense variant in the SYNPO2L gene (rs3812629) was found to be significantly associated with AF, with an odds ratio of 1.27. This variant lies at a known AF susceptibility locus and is in linkage disequilibrium with a top marker from prior analyses at the locus. The study did not observe significant associations between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Furthermore, individuals with AF did not display any statistically significant enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated AF genes. The results suggest that large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. The study's findings are consistent with other whole exome sequencing efforts of complex diseases, which have generally not identified coding variation as the major mechanisms underlying these conditions. The study highlights the need for larger sample sizes or populations enriched for large genetic effects to identify biologically meaningful coding variation underlying AF.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 cases of human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) were detected in Poland. The disease, caused by the Echinococcus multilocularis parasite, is a serious health threat in the Northern Hemisphere. The majority of cases, 83 (68.6%), were confirmed, 16 were probable, and 22 were possible. The number of cases increased over the two-decade period, with a mean age at diagnosis of 47.7 years and a sex ratio of 0.86:1 (male to female). The disease was fatal in 23 (19%) patients, with a mean age at death of 54.1 years. The liver was the primary location of the disease in all cases, and in 30 (24.8%) patients, the disease spread to other organs. Most patients, 94, were treated with albendazole, and 73 (60%) underwent surgery, including 15 liver transplantations. The study found that AE is an emerging disease in Poland, with a need for a wider national program to implement screening in high-risk areas, increase public awareness, and train primary care physicians to recognize the risk of AE for early detection.
Researchers studied how the E. coli bacterium responds to changes in zinc availability in its environment. They focused on the zinc-sensing protein Zur, which helps regulate gene expression in response to zinc levels. The team solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to a specific promoter and found that it represses gene expression by binding to DNA in a highly cooperative manner. This cooperative binding requires a specific interaction between two adjacent dimers of the Zur protein.

The researchers also discovered a new gene, pliG, that is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner. They found that the pliG promoter forms stable complexes with either one or two Zur dimers, but with less cooperativity than other promoters in the Zur regulon. The team compared the binding affinity of Zur to different promoters and found a 10,000-fold variation in binding constants. This variation in binding affinity correlates with the degree of repression observed in vivo, with some promoters showing a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δzur strains.

These findings suggest that the thermodynamics of protein-DNA interactions play a crucial role in regulating gene expression networks. The study provides new insights into how zinc availability and partial metal occupancy can fine-tune stress-responsive gene expression across different promoters. The results have implications for understanding how bacteria respond to changes in metal availability and how this affects their physiology.
Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a mosquito-borne disease that affects livestock, causing high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 2008-2009, an outbreak of RVF occurred on the island of Madagascar, including the Anjozorobe district in the highlands. Despite unfavorable climatic conditions for mosquito proliferation, a three-year serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed a recurrent circulation of the RVF virus (RVFV). To understand the key determinants of this unexpected transmission, a spatial deterministic discrete-time metapopulation model combined with a cattle trade network was designed and parameterized using observational data from the area. Three scenarios were analyzed: RVFV overwintering due to direct transmission between cattle when viraemic cows calve, a low-level vector-based circulation during winter, and a combination of both mechanisms. Multi-model inference methods resulted in a model incorporating both a low-level RVFV winter vector-borne transmission and a direct transmission between animals when viraemic cows calve. This model satisfactorily reproduced field observations, attributing 84% of cattle infections to vector-borne transmission and 16% to direct transmission. The study suggests that interweaving between agricultural works in rice fields, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle exchange practices are key elements for understanding RVFV circulation in the Madagascar highlands.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is a highly invasive and aggressive mosquito species that poses a significant public health threat in its expanding range. Researchers used genetic analysis to study the invasion history and population structure of Aedes albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region. They analyzed DNA samples from 911 individuals across 13 nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial COI sequences. The study found that Aedes albopictus was likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Southeast Asia, before colonizing the Solomon Islands via either Papua New Guinea or Southeast Asia. The analysis also suggested that the recent incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait Islands was seeded mainly from Indonesia. A recently colonized population in the Torres Strait Islands showed rapid temporal changes in its genetic makeup, which could be due to genetic drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source. The study found high spatial genetic structure and high gene flow between some geographically distant populations, indicating that the species' genetic structure in the region is driven mainly by human movements. The research provides a more comprehensive understanding of the invasion history and population structure of Aedes albopictus in the Indo-Pacific region, which can inform strategies for controlling the spread of this invasive species.
A study conducted in the Mwanza Region of North-Western Tanzania investigated the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the quality of life and physical fitness of 572 schoolchildren aged 7-8 years. The study found that 58.7% of the children were infected with S. mansoni, with most infections being light and 16.4% being heavy. Girls had significantly higher infection intensities than boys. The study also found that 30.1% of the children were anemic, but there was no association between S. mansoni infection and anthropometry, anaemia, liver or spleen pathology. However, children with S. mansoni infection had a lower score in the emotional dimension of quality of life compared to uninfected children. In contrast, infected children had a higher physical fitness level, as measured by VO2 max, compared to uninfected children. In multivariable linear regression analyses, age, S. mansoni infection, haemoglobin, and VO2 max were significant predictors of emotional quality of life, while physical quality of life, height, age, and haemoglobin were significant predictors of VO2 max. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection has a significant effect on the emotional dimension of quality of life, but not on physical fitness.
Researchers studied how rats become infected with Leptospira, a type of bacteria that causes leptospirosis, a disease found worldwide. They compared three different ways of infecting rats: through the mucous membranes, under the skin, and directly into the abdominal cavity. The goal was to understand how Leptospira spreads between rats in the wild.

The study found that all three methods of infection resulted in asymptomatic infections, meaning the rats did not show any symptoms. However, the rate of infection in the kidneys, where Leptospira typically resides, varied depending on the method of infection. Rats infected through the mucous membranes had the highest rate of kidney infection, followed by those infected through the abdominal cavity, and then those infected under the skin.

The study also found that the rate of antibody production, which is the body's immune response to the infection, was similar across all three methods of infection. However, the rate of antibody production was lower in rats with chronic infections compared to those with acute infections.

This study is important because it provides new insights into how Leptospira spreads between rats in the wild. The results suggest that mucous membrane infection is a more efficient way for Leptospira to colonize the kidneys and be excreted in the urine compared to skin infection. This knowledge can help researchers better understand the dynamics of Leptospira transmission in rat colonies and potentially inform strategies for controlling the spread of the disease.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called Annexin A2 (AnxA2) in the body's response to sepsis, a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection becomes uncontrolled. Sepsis can lead to tissue damage, organ failure, and death. The study found that AnxA2 helps to regulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the signaling molecule IL-17, which are involved in the inflammatory response. In mice with sepsis, a lack of AnxA2 led to increased levels of ROS and IL-17, resulting in a more severe inflammatory response and decreased survival.

The researchers used a mouse model of sepsis to study the role of AnxA2. They found that mice without AnxA2 had increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophils, but decreased bacterial clearance and survival. The study also showed that the cysteine residue at position 9 of AnxA2 is critical for regulating ROS levels. Furthermore, the researchers found that ROS is responsible for elevated IL-17 levels and the subsequent exaggerated inflammatory response.

The study suggests that targeting AnxA2 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating sepsis. The researchers also found that depleting IL-17 via a gene editing technique reduced inflammation and improved survival in mice with sepsis. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis and identifies AnxA2 as a critical regulator of the inflammatory response in this condition.
Researchers investigated how certain immune cells called macrophages become resistant to HIV-1 infection. They found that stimulation of these cells with polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) or bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly reduced HIV-1 infection. This effect was mediated by Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3 and 4, but not by TLR2, 7, or 9. The researchers discovered that microRNA-155 (miR-155) played a key role in this process. They found that miR-155 levels increased in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C) or LPS, and that inhibiting miR-155 partially restored HIV-1 infectivity. Ectopic expression of miR-155 also reduced HIV-1 infection in primary macrophages and cell lines. The study suggests that miR-155 targets several HIV-1 dependency factors involved in post-entry, pre-integration events, leading to a significant reduction in HIV-1 infection. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HIV-1 resistance in macrophages and highlight the potential of miR-155 as a therapeutic target to prevent HIV-1 infection.
Scientists have long known that plants grow at different rates depending on the time of day and the amount of light they receive. However, the exact mechanisms behind this phenomenon were not well understood. Researchers studied the growth of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and found that a group of genes associated with plant hormones, such as auxin and gibberellin, are expressed at specific times of the day when growth rates are highest. These genes contain a specific sequence, CACATG, in their promoters that allows them to respond to the circadian clock and light signals. The study found that the circadian clock indirectly controls growth by regulating the timing of phytohormone gene expression, allowing plants to fine-tune their growth in response to seasonal and environmental changes.

The researchers used DNA microarrays to analyze the transcriptome of Arabidopsis seedlings under different growth conditions and mutant backgrounds. They found that the expression of phytohormone genes is coordinated with the external coincidence of darkness and the internal coincidence of phytohormone signaling capacity. This suggests that the circadian clock acts upstream of light signaling to gate phytohormone gene expression during the early evening. The study also found that the circadian clock and light signaling pathways interact to coordinate the expression of genes from multiple phytohormone pathways, ensuring that plants can properly anticipate and respond to daily changes in their environment.
Researchers have developed a new method to control the spread of Chagas disease by modifying the gut microbiota of the insect vector, Rhodnius prolixus. This approach uses RNA interference (RNAi) to silence specific genes in the insect, making it less capable of transmitting the disease. The researchers used two types of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Rhodococcus rhodnii, to deliver double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to the insect's gut. The dsRNA targeted two specific genes: Rhodnius heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT). RHBP is involved in egg production, while CAT is an antioxidant enzyme.

The results showed that feeding the bacteria to nymphs and adult insects led to a significant reduction in RHBP and CAT gene expression in various tissues, including the fat body, midgut, and ovaries. This reduction in gene expression had a range of effects on the insects, including increased mortality rates, reduced molting rates, and decreased oviposition (egg-laying). The researchers also found that the earlier the insects received the bacterial treatment, the greater the impact on their fitness.

The study suggests that modifying the insect microbiota to induce systemic RNAi could be a sustainable strategy for controlling Chagas disease vectors. The researchers propose using the E. coli system as a high-throughput method to screen for targets to be further tested with the natural symbiont, R. rhodnii. This approach has the potential to provide a new tool for controlling the spread of Chagas disease.
A study conducted on the Thai-Burmese border from 2004 to 2006 found that fever in pregnant women is a significant health concern. Approximately 5% of pregnant women experienced febrile episodes, with malaria being the leading cause, accounting for 55.5% of cases. Arthropod-borne diseases such as malaria, rickettsial infections, and dengue, as well as zoonotic diseases like leptospirosis, were responsible for nearly half of all febrile illnesses. Coinfections were observed in 3.9% of women, mostly malaria and rickettsia. Pyelonephritis was also a common cause of fever, affecting 19.7% of women. After excluding malaria, pyelonephritis, and acute respiratory illness, one-third of remaining febrile infections were caused by rickettsia or leptospirosis. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight. Malaria remains the leading cause of fever in pregnancy on the Thai-Burmese border. The study suggests that febrile pregnant women without malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory tract infection should be treated with azithromycin, which is effective against typhus and leptospirosis. The findings highlight the need for better understanding and management of febrile illnesses in pregnant women in rural tropical areas to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Researchers studied the relationship between maternal age and recombination rates in humans. They analyzed data from over 600,000 genetic markers in 69 French-Canadian families and found a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age. This effect was observed in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions. The study suggests that recombination may become less efficient with age, which could contribute to higher rates of aneuploidy in older women. Aneuploidy is a condition where a person has an abnormal number of chromosomes, often resulting in trisomies. The researchers propose a model that explains how this relationship between maternal age and recombination could lead to aneuploidy. They also found that chromosome-specific effects may play a role in this relationship, which could vary among different populations. The study's findings support the idea that different chromosomes are subject to distinct selective, mechanistic, or structural constraints that influence recombination patterns over time. The researchers compared recombination hotspots in mothers younger and older than 30 years of age and found that the reduction in recombination rates was more pronounced in the middle section of chromosomal arms and near subtelomeric regions in older mothers. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between maternal age and recombination in humans.
Researchers have discovered a new way to boost the immune system's ability to fight off fungal infections. They found that by exposing macrophages, a type of immune cell, to a protein called interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) in the body, they can create a long-lasting memory-like response. This response allows the macrophages to quickly and effectively fight off future infections, even in the absence of other immune cells.

The researchers tested this approach using a fungus called Cryptococcus neoformans, which can cause serious illness in people with weakened immune systems. They found that macrophages that had been primed with IFN-γ were able to provide complete protection against secondary infections for at least 70 days. This is a significant breakthrough, as current vaccines often rely on the adaptive immune system, which can be compromised in people with weakened immune systems.

The researchers used a technique called RNA sequencing to analyze the genes that were turned on or off in the macrophages after they were primed with IFN-γ. They found that the STAT1 pathway, a key part of the immune response, was rapidly activated when the macrophages encountered the fungus again. This activation was associated with increased binding of the STAT1 protein to specific genes involved in anti-fungal immunity.

The study suggests that this approach could be a novel and effective way to induce vaccine-mediated protection in people with weakened immune systems. The researchers propose that immunization strategies that drive memory-like innate immune responses could provide a new way to protect against fungal infections in people who are immunocompromised.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and development in plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, PRCs are composed of multiple subunits that work together to repress gene expression through histone modification. Researchers have long sought to understand how PRCs target specific genes for repression, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear.

A recent study has shed light on this mystery by examining the role of different PRC subunits in Arabidopsis seedlings. The study found that the PRC2 subunit CURLY LEAF (CLF) coordinates with other PRC subunits to repress distinct developmental programs. Specifically, CLF works with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1) to repress flower development genes, while PRC1-catalytic core subunits AtBMI1 and AtRING1 work with PRC2-catalytic enzymes CLF or SWINGER (SWN) to repress embryo development genes.

The study also found that the target specificity of PRCs is modulated by specific transcription factors (TFs), including MADS box and ABA-related factors. The researchers propose that different combinations of PRC members regulate different developmental programs, and that their target specificity is influenced by specific TFs. This study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of PRC-mediated gene regulation and highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between PRCs and TFs in plant development.
Scientists have studied the "trigger loop" (TL) of RNA polymerase II, a crucial component of the enzyme responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA. The TL plays a key role in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation during the transcription process. To better understand the TL's function, researchers created nearly all possible single variants of the TL in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and analyzed their effects on the cell. This approach, called phenotypic landscape analysis, revealed three distinct classes of mutants with different effects on transcription and stress responses.

The study found that mutations disrupting a hydrophobic pocket within the TL led to increased catalytic activity, suggesting that this pocket plays a role in stabilizing a catalytically inactive state of the TL. Additionally, the researchers discovered that interactions between the TL and nearby domains, such as the funnel and bridge helices, contribute to the TL's dynamics and function.

The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of transcription and the evolution of the TL sequence and function. The phenotypic landscape approach used in this study can be applied to other essential yeast proteins, expanding our understanding of their functions and mechanisms. The research also sheds light on the delicate balance of TL function, which is critical for proper transcriptional activity. Mutations that disrupt this balance can result in either increased or decreased catalytic activity and altered translocation dynamics, leading to distinct consequences for transcriptional activity.
Researchers studied how the rabies virus (RV) spreads through the body and causes disease. They infected mice with two different strains of RV, one from dogs (DOG4) and one from silver-haired bats (SB), either by injecting it into their muscles (i.m.) or directly into their bloodstream (i.v.). The team found that while both strains caused severe disease when injected into muscles, only the bat-associated strain (SB) caused severe disease when injected into the bloodstream. This suggests that the bat-associated strain can spread to the brain through the bloodstream, while the dog-associated strain cannot. The researchers used special tests to track the spread of the virus and found that the bat-associated strain directly infected the brain, specifically targeting the hypothalamus, a region connected to the pituitary gland. This is a new way that the virus can spread to the brain, in addition to the usual route through nerve cells. The findings have implications for how to prevent rabies after exposure, particularly for people who may be exposed to the bat-associated strain.
Researchers studied the evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus, which has caused significant illness and death in humans since the 1918 pandemic. They analyzed 71 complete genome sequences of the virus from 1918 to 2006 and found that segmental reassortment played a key role in the virus's evolution. Reassortment is a process where genetic material from different viruses combines to create a new virus.

The researchers discovered that an H1N1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired new genes through reassortment, which may have contributed to the sudden change in the virus's antigenic properties. Similarly, the 1951 influenza epidemic may have been caused by reassortant H1N1 viruses. The study suggests that reassortment is a more important factor in the evolution and spread of H1N1 influenza A virus than previously thought.

The researchers also found that while the eight genome segments of H1N1 viruses generally evolved together, there were distinct reassortment events affecting specific segments. This study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of the H1N1 virus, which has had a significant impact on human health. The findings may help improve our understanding of the virus's behavior and inform strategies for preventing future outbreaks.
Researchers investigated how nicotine affects the brain's reward system, specifically the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which plays a key role in signaling reward and motivation. Nicotine stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the VTA, leading to an increase in dopamine output. The study aimed to determine whether nicotine's effect on the VTA is due to direct stimulation of dopamine cells or disinhibition of GABAergic interneurons.

A computational model of the VTA circuitry and nAChR function was developed to shed light on this issue. The model showed that both direct stimulation of dopamine cells and disinhibition through desensitization of nAChRs on GABAergic interneurons can mediate the acute effects of nicotine. The study found that the rate of endogenous acetylcholine input is crucial in determining the evoked dopamine response for both mechanisms.

The results suggest that low endogenous cholinergic input is necessary for direct stimulation, while high cholinergic inputs are required for disinhibition. The study also found that the GABAergic cells play a critical role in the action of nicotine. The model was able to capture in vitro and in vivo data, including the modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to dopamine neurons and the direct activation of β2-containing nAChRs on dopamine neurons.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which the VTA mediates the acute rewarding properties of nicotine and suggests an acetylcholine dependence hypothesis for nicotine reinforcement.
Researchers conducted a clinical trial in Kabul, Afghanistan to develop a new treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, a chronic skin disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The study aimed to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve the cosmetic outcome of the disease. A total of 113 patients with Leishmania tropica infection were randomly assigned to two groups: one received high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by daily moist-wound-treatment (MWT) with a hydrogel containing sodium chlorite (DAC N-055), while the other group received EC and MWT without DAC N-055.

The primary outcome was the time needed for complete wound closure, which was similar in both groups (43.1 days and 42 days, respectively). However, in patients with Leishmania-positive biopsies after wound closure, the addition of DAC N-055 resulted in faster wound epithelialization (37.2 days vs. 58.3 days). Superinfections occurred at the same rate in both groups, but reulcerations were more common in patients with persistent high parasite loads after healing.

In vitro studies showed that DAC N-055 had a leishmanicidal effect on the parasites. Compared to previous results using intralesional antimony injections, the EC plus MWT protocol led to more rapid wound closure. The study suggests that the combination of EC and MWT with or without DAC N-055 may be an effective treatment for cutaneous leishmaniasis, particularly in patients with persistent parasite loads. Further studies are needed to confirm the activity of DAC N-055 and its potential to prevent relapses.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify factors that impact RAS-mediated MAPK activation. The screen revealed 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known factors associated with the RAS/MAPK pathway. However, surprisingly, most of the new hits were found to work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consisted of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. Two representative members of this group were further characterized and found to act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. The study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila and suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. The findings indicate that core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing. The researchers employed a three-step screening strategy, including a primary genome-wide RNAi screen, a validation screening step, and a series of secondary screens to establish the position of regulatory input relative to known pathway components. The study identified several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway, including a new protein complex modulating RAF activation and five novel components acting upstream of RAF.
Researchers in Thailand conducted a study to better understand the genetic diversity of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex, which causes cryptococcosis, a serious fungal infection. They analyzed 498 isolates from various sources, including clinical, environmental, and veterinary samples. The majority of the isolates were from male patients with a mean age of 37.97 years, and 88.5% of C. neoformans and 37.5% of C. gattii strains were from HIV patients.

The study found that the majority of the isolates were C. neoformans molecular type VNI, regardless of their source. Other molecular types, such as VNII, VNIV, VGI, and VGII, were found less frequently. Multilocus Sequence Type (MLST) analysis identified 20 sequence types (ST) in Thailand, including some that were unique to the country. The study also found that most C. gattii isolates were ST7, which is identical to the less virulent minor Vancouver island outbreak genotype.

The study revealed a greater genetic diversity and a wider range of major molecular types among Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported. The findings suggest that Thailand may be a stepping stone in the global spread of the C. gattii outbreak strain. The study highlights the need for further research on the epidemiology and virulence of the Cryptococcus neoformans/C. gattii species complex to better manage the disease in Thailand.
Researchers studied the evolution of transcription factors (TFs) in fruit flies to understand how regulatory networks change over time. They focused on a specific type of TF called C2H2-ZF, which is the largest class of metazoan TFs. By analyzing 12 Drosophila species spanning 45 million years of evolution, they found that a significant fraction of C2H2-ZF 1-to-1 orthologs exhibit variations that can affect their DNA-binding specificities. These variations were found in about 44% of domains shared between Drosophila melanogaster and other fly species. The researchers also discovered that these diverging DNA-contacting residues tend to be conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolve slower than other diverging residues, indicating functional constraint. Furthermore, these variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of Drosophila melanogaster flies, suggesting their rapid fixation. The predicted specificities of these dynamic domains gradually change across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. The study suggests that a subset of highly dynamic and largely unstudied TFs are a likely source of regulatory variation in Drosophila and other metazoans. The researchers also found that proteins with conserved C2H2-ZF domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those with varying domains exhibit no functional enrichments. This study challenges the assumption that 1-to-1 orthologous TFs are always highly conserved and provides evidence that binding specificity modifications in single-copy TFs may play an important role in the regulatory evolution of Drosophila and other higher metazoans.
Researchers have developed a new method to quickly and accurately identify two types of bacteria that cause typhoid and paratyphoid fevers: Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A. The method uses a technique called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) to target specific DNA sequences in the bacteria. This allows for the creation of PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays that can detect and differentiate between the two serotypes.

The new assays were tested on a large collection of strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins, and time periods, as well as on strains of other bacteria that can cause similar symptoms. The results showed that the assays were 100% sensitive and specific, meaning they could accurately identify the two serotypes without producing false positives or false negatives.

The new method is an improvement over existing PCR protocols, which often use multiple markers to target each serotype and may not be as accurate. The CRISPR-based assays are also more convenient and can be used in a wide range of clinical and public health laboratories with access to PCR technology. The researchers believe that these assays could be adapted for use with clinical and other samples, not just cultured isolates.

The new method has the potential to accelerate the diagnosis of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, which are often difficult to diagnose due to the lack of typing sera and the need for culture. The researchers are confident that the CRISPR targets are suitable for the specific detection of all populations of serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi A.
Researchers studied the role of Notch receptors in the immune system's response to a parasite called Leishmania major. They found that two specific Notch receptors, Notch1 and Notch2, play a crucial role in the development of a type of immune cell called T helper 1 (Th1) cells. Th1 cells produce a protein called interferon-gamma (IFNγ), which helps fight off the parasite.

In the study, mice with a specific deletion of Notch1, Notch2, or both receptors were infected with Leishmania major. The mice that lacked both Notch1 and Notch2 receptors (N1N2ΔCD4Cre) were unable to produce IFNγ and developed severe infections. In contrast, mice with a single deletion of either Notch1 or Notch2 (N1ΔCD4Cre or N2ΔCD4Cre) were able to produce IFNγ and fight off the infection.

The researchers also found that Notch signaling is necessary for the secretion of IFNγ by Th1 cells. However, they discovered that this effect is independent of a protein called CSL/RBP-Jκ, which is typically involved in Notch signaling. The study suggests that Notch signaling through Notch1 and Notch2 is crucial for the development of a functional Th1 immune response against Leishmania major infection.

The findings have implications for the development of new vaccines and immunotherapies against Leishmania and other infections that require a protective IFNγ-secreting CD4+ Th1 immune response.
A recent study in rhesus macaques found that infection with the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni significantly increases the risk of acquiring the AIDS virus. Researchers exposed two groups of monkeys to decreasing doses of the simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV-C) after infecting one group with S. mansoni. The results showed that the infected monkeys became systemically infected with the virus at doses that were too low to infect the uninfected monkeys. In fact, the dose required to infect 50% of the infected monkeys was 17 times lower than for the uninfected monkeys. The infected monkeys also had higher levels of viral RNA and increased viral replication in immune cells called CD4+ central memory cells. These findings suggest that controlling helminth infections, such as schistosomiasis, may be a useful strategy to reduce the spread of HIV-1 in areas where both parasites and the virus are common. The study provides the first direct evidence that helminth infection increases susceptibility to mucosal AIDS virus transmission in primates. The results have significant public health implications, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where both parasites and HIV-1 are prevalent and HIV/AIDS cases are disproportionately high. The study's findings support the idea that controlling helminth infections could help reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS in these regions.
Researchers have developed a computer model to study how the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) affects brain activity during sleep and wakefulness. The model shows that changes in ACh levels can lead to three distinct patterns of brain activity: localized, traveling asynchronous, and traveling synchronous waves. These patterns are similar to those observed in real brain activity during different stages of sleep and wakefulness. The model suggests that ACh plays a key role in determining the type of brain activity that occurs, with high ACh levels leading to localized activity and low ACh levels leading to traveling waves. The model also shows that the level of ACh determines how sensitive brain activity is to variations in the strength of connections between brain cells.

The researchers found that when ACh levels are high, brain activity is more localized and can be easily disrupted by small changes in the strength of connections between brain cells. However, when ACh levels are low, brain activity becomes more synchronized and can travel long distances across the brain. This could have important implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and stores information during sleep and wakefulness. The model also suggests that ACh may play a role in regulating the strength of connections between brain cells, which could be important for learning and memory. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of ACh in regulating brain activity and its potential role in sleep and wakefulness.
Researchers investigated the role of mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway in the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a type of cancer that occurs in the esophagus. They analyzed genetic data from 171 EAC patients and found that mutations in the TLR pathway were present in 14.6% of the tumors. These mutations were more common in tumors that had spread to other parts of the body, suggesting that they may play a role in the progression of the disease. The researchers also found that TLR4, a specific gene in the TLR pathway, was the most frequently mutated gene, with 5.8% of EAC tumors having mutations in this gene. The mutations in TLR4 were confirmed to affect the gene's ability to respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, a molecule that triggers an immune response. The study also found that TLR pathway mutations were not limited to EAC, but were also present in other types of cancer that are exposed to the microbiome, such as colorectal adenocarcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and uterine endometrioid carcinoma. Overall, the study suggests that mutations in the TLR pathway, particularly in the TLR4 gene, may play a role in the development and progression of EAC and other cancers.
Scientists have long known that the sense of taste is crucial for animal survival, but the process of how taste cells develop has remained a mystery. Researchers used a new approach to study the development of taste cells in mice by combining computer analysis and laboratory experiments. They focused on a group of genes called TRCSMs, which play a key role in detecting sweet, bitter, and umami tastes. By analyzing the DNA sequences of these genes, the researchers identified a protein called Hes1 as a potential regulator of taste cell development.

Further experiments showed that Hes1 is indeed involved in the development of taste cells. In mice without the Hes1 gene, the number of taste cells in the tongue increased significantly, suggesting that Hes1 normally helps to control the number of taste cells. The researchers also found that Hes1 is expressed in the same cells as the TRCSMs, and that its levels decrease as the taste cells mature. This suggests that Hes1 plays a role in the early stages of taste cell development, helping to determine which cells will become taste cells and which will not.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the development of taste cells and the role of Hes1 in this process. The findings could have implications for our understanding of taste disorders and the development of new treatments for taste-related conditions.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between ethylene and auxin in regulating root growth in rice, a crucial crop worldwide. Unlike the dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis, the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice is not well understood. The study found that the transcriptional activation of OsEIL1 on the expression of YUC8/REIN7 and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Using a YUC activity inhibitor, the researchers showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. They identified a rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein7-1, in which YUC8/REIN7 is truncated at its C-terminus, resulting in reduced auxin biosynthesis and enhanced ethylene sensitivity in the roots. The study revealed that YUC8/REIN7 catalyzes the conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and is essential for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and ethylene-inhibited root elongation in rice early seedlings. Furthermore, the researchers found that ethylene induces YUC8/REIN7 expression and promotes auxin accumulation in roots. The addition of low concentrations of IAA rescued the ethylene response in the rein7-1 mutant, demonstrating that ethylene-inhibited root elongation depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. The study also showed that YUC8/REIN7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functions downstream of OsEIL1, which directly activates the expression of YUC8/REIN7.
A nationwide study in Saudi Arabia has shed light on the growing concern of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases in the country. The study, the first of its kind in Saudi Arabia, collected and analyzed 527 NTM isolates from patients over a 24-month period. The results showed that 75.1% of the isolates were pulmonary in origin, with 44.7% having a proven clinical significance. The study identified 34 NTM species, including 17 rare species, with M. simiae, M. fortuitum, and M. abscessus being the most prevalent. Notably, 27 new cases of clinically relevant M. riyadhense were also detected.

The study found that diabetes mellitus and a previous history of tuberculosis were independent risk factors associated with NTM diseases. Rare clinical events, such as mycobacteremia, cecum abscess, peritonitis, and ascites, were caused by M. wolinskyi, M. holsaticum, M. duvalii, and M. monacence, respectively. The study highlights the emerging challenge of NTM disease spectrum and pathogen diversity in Saudi Arabia, emphasizing the need for immediate action to develop diagnostic infrastructures and disease management plans.

The study's findings suggest that the Saudi population is vulnerable to NTM diseases, and a detailed management plan for mycobacterial disease control is necessary. The study's results also underscore the importance of addressing the emergence of new pathogens, such as M. riyadhense, and difficult-to-treat species like M. simiae.
Yeast cells have a unique ability to enter a state of quiescence, or dormancy, when they are starved of glucose or other essential nutrients. This adaptation allows them to survive for extended periods without food. However, the molecular mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. Researchers have identified three key kinases, Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15, that play a crucial role in regulating quiescence entry and lifespan extension in yeast. These kinases work together to reprogram the cell's metabolism, allowing it to accumulate energy stores in the form of trehalose and glycogen. The accumulation of these storage carbohydrates is essential for quiescence exit and lifespan extension. When yeast cells are starved of glucose, the Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15 kinases are activated, leading to the production of trehalose and glycogen. The more storage carbohydrates a yeast cell accumulates, the longer it can survive in a state of quiescence. Conversely, yeast cells that are unable to accumulate storage carbohydrates due to mutations in the genes encoding these kinases or the enzymes responsible for trehalose and glycogen production have a significantly reduced lifespan. The researchers found that overexpressing the genes responsible for trehalose and glycogen production or supplementing the growth medium with trehalose can rescue the lifespan defects in yeast cells with mutations in the Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15 kinases. These findings suggest that the primary goal of the signaling pathways activated by glucose starvation is to reprogram the cell's metabolism to accumulate energy stores, allowing it to survive in a state of quiescence.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the influenza A virus (IAV) adapts to the human immune system. The virus's hemagglutinin (HA) protein, which helps the virus attach to and enter host cells, can be modified with sugar molecules called glycans. This modification, called glycosylation, can compensate for the loss of fitness that occurs when the virus mutates to evade antibodies produced by the immune system. In other words, glycosylation can help the virus maintain its ability to infect cells even when it has changed in a way that makes it harder for antibodies to recognize and neutralize it.

The researchers used a technique called primerID to study the genetic diversity of IAV populations. This allowed them to identify the role of glycosylation in compensating for fitness costs associated with antigenic escape. They found that the addition of glycans to the HA protein can increase the virus's ability to bind to host cells, even in the absence of antibodies.

This discovery expands our understanding of how IAV adapts to the human immune system and highlights the importance of glycosylation in this process. It also demonstrates the power of high-definition virus population sequencing in revealing new mechanisms of viral adaptation. The findings have implications for the development of more effective vaccines and therapeutics against IAV.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of 13 ventricular myocyte models to identify potential targets for antiarrhythmic drugs that exhibit favorable rate dependence. The study aimed to overcome the problem of reverse rate dependence, a property of some antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong the cardiac action potential (AP) more at slow heart rates, leading to reduced arrhythmia suppression at fast rates and increased arrhythmia risk at slow rates. By simulating populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzing population results statistically, the researchers predicted the rate-dependent effects of changes in multiple model parameters. An average of 40 parameters were tested in each model, and effects on AP duration were assessed at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates.

The analysis identified various forward rate-dependent (FRD) ionic current perturbations and generated specific predictions regarding their mechanisms. For instance, an increase in L-type calcium current is FRD when accompanied by indirect, rate-dependent changes in slow delayed rectifier potassium current. The study also found that inward rectifier potassium current and the sodium-potassium pump are the two targets most likely to produce FRD AP prolongation. A statistical analysis of results from the 13 models demonstrated that models displaying minimal rate-dependent changes in AP shape have little capacity for FRD perturbations, whereas models with large shape changes have considerable FRD potential. This can explain differences between species and between ventricular cell types. The study provides new insights into the determinants of AP duration rate dependence and illustrates a strategy for designing potentially beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the relationship between genetic variations and various health conditions, known as Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS). In this study, they applied this method to investigate how genetic variations affect the activity of an enzyme called thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) in patients taking thiopurine drugs. TPMT helps break down thiopurine drugs, which are used to treat conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The researchers used data from a French hospital's clinical database to analyze the relationship between TPMT activity and various health conditions, including ICD-10 codes and biological test results. They found that patients with high TPMT activity were more likely to have iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus. This study is the first to use ICD-10 codes in a PheWAS, which is a significant improvement over previous studies that used ICD-9-CM codes. The researchers also validated their findings by cross-checking them with biological test results. This study demonstrates the potential of PheWAS to identify new subgroups of patients who may require personalized clinical and therapeutic management. The findings suggest that high TPMT activity may be associated with a failure of thiopurine therapy and sustained steroid requirements in IBD patients. This study highlights the importance of considering genetic variations in the treatment of patients with IBD and other conditions.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of animal studies to investigate the effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in treating traumatic spinal cord injuries. They analyzed 156 publications using 45 different stem cell preparations and found that allogeneic stem cell treatment improved both motor and sensory outcomes in animal models of spinal cord injury. The analysis showed that allogeneic stem cell treatment resulted in a 27.2% improvement in motor function and a 26.3% improvement in sensory function. However, the effectiveness of stem cell treatment varied depending on factors such as the type of stem cell used, the route of delivery, and the experimental design. For example, stem cells that were differentiated before implantation and delivered intravenously showed better outcomes. In contrast, stem cell implantation did not improve sensory outcomes in female animals and was enhanced by the use of isoflurane anesthesia. The study also found that the location of the injury, method of injury induction, and presence of immunosuppression had an impact on motor outcomes. The researchers noted that the reporting of measures to reduce bias was higher than in other neuroscience domains, but still suboptimal. They also found that studies that did not report blinded assessment of outcomes gave inflated estimates of efficacy. The study suggests that stem-cell-based therapies may offer promise in treating spinal cord injuries, but the impact of compromised internal validity and publication bias may mean that the actual efficacy is lower than reported.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 154 studies on soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections found that reinfection rates are high after treatment with anthelmintic drugs. The review focused on Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura infections, which affect over a billion people worldwide. The study found that reinfection rates for A. lumbricoides were 26% at 3 months, 68% at 6 months, and 94% at 12 months post-treatment. For T. trichiura, reinfection rates were 36% at 3 months, 67% at 6 months, and 82% at 12 months post-treatment. Hookworm reinfection rates were 30% at 3 months, 55% at 6 months, and 57% at 12 months post-treatment. The study also found that the prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with the initial pretreatment infection status. This suggests that frequent anthelmintic drug administrations may be necessary to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy. The review highlights the need for integrated control approaches that emphasize health education and environmental sanitation to interrupt the transmission of STH. The study's findings support the use of egg reduction rate (ERR) rather than cure rate (CR) for evaluating anthelmintic drug efficacy and studying patterns of reinfection after treatment.
Researchers have developed a new method called Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) to investigate the deregulation of metabolic processes in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is a condition characterized by the buildup of fat in the liver, which can lead to inflammation and scarring. Current methods for studying NAFLD rely on predefined pathway maps, but these can be biased and limited by the complexity of metabolic networks. MiNEA overcomes these limitations by generating all possible alternative minimal networks (MiNs) that can synthesize a target metabolite. This approach allows researchers to identify deregulated MiNs and key regulators in different NAFLD phenotypes, such as fatty liver and liver inflammation, in both humans and mice.

The researchers applied MiNEA to condition-specific transcriptomics data from liver samples and identified key deregulations in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate in both humans and mice. They also found that key regulators of the hydrogen peroxide synthesis network were regulated differently in humans and mice. MiNEA is a flexible method that can be applied to any genome-scale metabolic network (GEM) and target metabolite, making it a valuable tool for studying condition-specific metabolism in various diseases and organisms. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of MiNEA to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NAFLD and other metabolic disorders.
Researchers have proposed a new theory called primacy coding, which suggests that the brain identifies odors based on the types of receptors that respond earliest to an odor. This theory provides a compact and efficient way for the brain to interpret the vast number of possible odors. A study analyzed a simple model of primacy coding using numerical simulations and statistical descriptions, and found that the encoded information depends on the number of receptor types included in the representation, but not on the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is also independent of the odor intensity, making it useful for identifying odors in the olfactory cortex. The study found that primacy coding outperforms other simple coding schemes, such as binary and normalized coding, because the sparsity of the odor representations is independent of the odor statistics. This means that primacy coding can provide a robust and compact representation of the odor identity over a wide range of odors. However, the performance of the olfactory system relies on tuned receptor sensitivities, suggesting that there is a strong selective pressure to adjust the sensitivities on evolutionary and shorter timescales. The study's results suggest that the primacy code formed in the olfactory bulb is more useful for identifying odors in the subsequent olfactory cortex than simple alternatives.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of broadly neutralizing HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) in neutralizing a wide range of HIV viruses. They found that all bnMAbs tested showed incomplete neutralization, meaning they did not reach 100% neutralization of all viruses. Additionally, many bnMAbs had neutralization curves that did not follow a typical sigmoidal shape, instead plateauing at less than 100% neutralization. This phenomenon was observed in both laboratory-grown viruses and viruses isolated from patients. The study found that bnMAbs targeting the V2 apex of the HIV envelope protein and the gp41 region were more likely to show incomplete neutralization, while those targeting the high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to do so. The researchers also found that two antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site showed incomplete neutralization relatively infrequently. The study's findings have implications for the use of bnMAbs in HIV therapy and vaccine design, as they suggest that these antibodies may not be as effective as previously thought in neutralizing all HIV viruses. The study's results also highlight the need for further research into the mechanisms underlying incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoidal neutralization curves, which may be influenced by factors such as glycan heterogeneity and conformational heterogeneity of the HIV envelope protein.
Researchers used a computer model to study how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine for energy and growth. They found that when cancer cells use a lot of glutamine, they produce more lactate from glucose, even in the presence of oxygen. This is different from normal cells, which typically use oxygen to produce energy from glucose. The model showed that this metabolic pattern is optimal for cancer cells to grow and produce energy. It involves a branched process called the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which uses glutamine to produce lipids and proteins. The researchers also found that this pattern is controlled by redox reactions, which are chemical reactions that involve the transfer of electrons. They validated their findings by studying a cell line that had been transformed by a cancer-causing gene. The results suggest that the way cancer cells use glucose and glutamine may be a key factor in their ability to grow and thrive. This metabolic rewiring may be a common feature of many types of cancer cells, and could be a target for new cancer therapies. The researchers used a constraint-based approach to evaluate the possible metabolic pathways that cancer cells can use to produce biomass from glucose and glutamine. They found that there are specific boundary conditions that promote the emergence of cancer metabolic rewiring, and that this rewiring is optimal for cancer cell growth and energy production.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the cellular prion protein (PrPC) converts to a disease-associated form (PrPSc) that causes fatal neurodegenerative diseases. To do this, they studied the interactions between PrPC and other proteins in a cell culture model. They also looked at two mammalian paralogs, Doppel (Prnd) and Shadoo (Sprn), which are similar to PrPC. The study found that PrPC, Prnd, and Sprn have similar interactions with other proteins in the cell, including the neural cell adhesion molecule, laminin receptor precursor, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). These interactions suggest that PrPC and its paralogs are embedded in specialized membrane domains that support cell adhesion, lactate metabolism, and cell fusion events. The study also found that PDI interactions with PrPC may occur outside of the endoplasmic reticulum, which could play a role in the accumulation of PrPSc. The researchers propose a hypothesis that PrPC organizes its molecular environment by binding to adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, which recognize oligomannose-bearing membrane proteins. This study provides new insights into the molecular environment that supports the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc and the interactions between PrPC and its paralogs.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to influenza virus infection in the lungs. They found that a type of immune cell called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) produces a cytokine called interleukin-5 (IL-5) in response to the infection. IL-5 is important for the maturation and release of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. The researchers discovered that ILC2 cells in the lungs produce IL-5 during the recovery phase of the infection, after the virus has been cleared. This IL-5 production leads to the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs.

The researchers also found that another type of immune cell called NKT cells and alveolar macrophages produce a molecule called IL-33, which stimulates ILC2 cells to produce more IL-5. This interaction between ILC2 cells, NKT cells, and alveolar macrophages is responsible for the accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs during the recovery phase of the infection.

The study suggests that IL-5 production in the lungs during influenza infection may have both positive and negative effects. On the one hand, it can lead to the accumulation of eosinophils, which can exacerbate asthma symptoms. On the other hand, IL-5 may also have tissue-protective effects. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of IL-5 in the immune response to influenza infection.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of iNTS disease in Asia are not well-documented. A study conducted in an infectious disease hospital in southern Vietnam from 2008 to 2013 identified 102 cases of iNTS infections. The majority of patients were HIV-infected adults, with 71% being male and 33% reporting intravenous drug use. The study found that 28% of patients with a known outcome died, with HIV infection being a significant risk factor for death. The most commonly identified serovars were S. Enteritidis (48%) and S. Typhimurium (26%), with S. Typhimurium being more common in HIV-infected individuals. Isolates from HIV-infected patients were also more likely to exhibit reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The study highlights that iNTS disease is a severe infection in Vietnam, with a high mortality rate, and that HIV infection is a major risk factor for both infection and death. The study's findings are similar to those in sub-Saharan Africa, where HIV infection is also a significant risk factor for iNTS disease. The study suggests that continued surveillance is necessary to monitor for the emergence or introduction of multi-drug resistant strains or strains with enhanced virulence.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify viral and phage structural proteins using artificial neural networks (ANNs). These proteins are crucial for the survival and pathogenicity of their hosts, and their identification can aid in disease diagnosis, vaccine development, and understanding the physiological impact of viruses on microbial communities and human health. However, identifying these proteins from sequence data can be challenging due to low sequence conservation and limited experimental data.

The researchers trained ANNs to classify viral structural proteins using amino acid frequency and protein isoelectric points. The ANNs were able to correctly classify a large fraction of test cases with high specificity and sensitivity. To validate the predictions, the researchers examined several ORFs with no significant similarities to known sequences that were predicted to be structural proteins by the ANNs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that some of these ORFs self-assembled into structures resembling virion structures.

The ANNs were able to identify phage and potential prophage structural proteins that are difficult or impossible to detect by other bioinformatic analysis. The networks will be valuable when sequence data is available but in vitro propagation of the phage may not be practical or possible. The researchers achieved an accuracy of ∼80% in identifying a broad spectrum of phage and viral structural proteins, and ∼90% specificity in identifying phage capsid or tail proteins.
Researchers have identified a protein called oligoadenylate synthetase-like protein (OASL) as an interacting partner of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) protein ORF20. ORF20 is a member of the herpesviral core UL24 family, but its function and role in the viral life cycle were not well understood. The study used a technique called quantitative affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry (q-AP-MS) to identify OASL as an interaction partner of ORF20. This interaction was conserved among all ORF20 isoforms and multiple ORF20 homologs of the UL24 family in other herpesviruses.

The researchers found that OASL and ORF20 shared numerous ribosomal interaction partners and copurified with 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits. When expressed together, they associated with polysomes, but did not have a global effect on translation. The study also showed that OASL enhanced the expression of endogenous OASL in an IRF3-dependent but IFNAR-independent manner.

Interestingly, the researchers found that OASL enhanced the infection of KSHV, but this effect was lost when a mutant version of ORF20 was used. This suggests that ORF20 usurps the function of OASL to benefit KSHV infection. The study also found that OASL and ORF20 mRNA expression were induced early after reactivation of latently infected HuARLT-rKSHV cells. Overall, the study provides new insights into the interaction between OASL and ORF20 and their roles in KSHV infection.
A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. The study included 913 consecutive febrile children aged 1 month to 15 years admitted to a hospital over a year. Of these, 373 (40.9%) had fever, and 108 (29%) presented with convulsions. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%) in febrile admissions, with 3/108 (2.8%) in children with convulsions and 10/265 (3.8%) in those without convulsions. The study found that LVD was not significantly associated with convulsions in febrile children. However, vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with an increased prevalence of LVD. The study suggests that LVD is an important cause of fever, including undifferentiated fever, in children in endemic areas, but its prevalence and lack of clinical differentiation on presentation underscore the importance of a high index of suspicion in diagnosis. The study recommends screening febrile children with undifferentiated fever in endemic areas for LVD as an important medical and public health control measure.
Researchers have identified a key player in a plant's ability to withstand drought: the karrikin receptor KAI2. In a study on Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant often used as a model organism, scientists found that mutations in the KAI2 gene made plants more sensitive to water deprivation. This led to increased water loss, cell damage, and reduced ability to close stomata, which are small openings on the plant's surface that allow for gas exchange. The researchers also found that kai2 plants produced less anthocyanin, a pigment that helps protect plants from stress, and were less responsive to abscisic acid, a hormone that helps regulate stomatal closure.

Further analysis revealed that KAI2-dependent signaling plays a positive role in drought resistance by regulating cell membrane stability, stomatal movement, cuticle development, and anthocyanin production. The researchers propose that KAI2 is activated by karrikins, a class of compounds found in smoke, and that this activation leads to the regulation of downstream genes involved in these processes. The study also found that strigolactones, a type of plant hormone, contribute to drought adaptation, but through a different pathway. The findings suggest that manipulating KAI2 and strigolactone signaling could provide new ways to improve drought resistance in crops. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms underlying plant drought adaptation and highlights the importance of KAI2-dependent signaling in this process.
Researchers investigated the role of insulin receptors in the growth and development of adult Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans. They found that human insulin binds to the parasite's insulin receptors, which are essential for the parasite's growth, development, and egg production. The researchers used a technique called RNA interference (RNAi) to knock down the expression of the insulin receptors in the parasite and observed a significant decrease in glucose uptake and a reduction in the parasite's ability to produce eggs. They also found that the knockdown of the insulin receptors led to a decrease in the expression of other genes involved in glucose metabolism and the parasite's fecundity. In vaccine/challenge experiments, the researchers found that a recombinant form of the parasite's insulin receptor (rSjLD1 and rSjLD2) depressed the parasite's growth, intestinal granuloma density, and fecal egg production in mice infected with the parasite. These findings suggest that the insulin receptors could be a potential target for a vaccine against schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people in China and the Philippines. The study provides further evidence that the parasite exploits the host's insulin for its growth and development, and that targeting the insulin receptors could be an effective way to block the parasite's life cycle.
Researchers have made a breakthrough in the fight against lymphatic filariasis (LF), a leading cause of disability in the South Pacific, where over 1.7 million people are at risk of infection. Current mass drug administration (MDA) efforts have reduced LF prevalence, but the mosquito vector, Aedes polynesiensis, continues to pose a challenge. This mosquito species is difficult to control using existing methods, which has hindered efforts to eliminate LF in some regions. To address this issue, scientists have developed a new strategy involving interspecific hybridization and introgression. They created a strain of Aedes polynesiensis, called the "CP" strain, that is infected with the Wolbachia bacteria from another mosquito species, Aedes riversi. This infection makes the CP strain bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory tests showed that CP males are just as competitive as wild-type males, and when introduced into wild-type Aedes polynesiensis populations, they can lead to population elimination. This finding demonstrates the feasibility of using this approach as a supplement to ongoing MDA efforts to eliminate LF transmission in the South Pacific. The strategy involves releasing bi-directionally incompatible males to induce sterility in female mosquitoes, effectively breaking the LF transmission cycle. This breakthrough has the potential to be extended to other vector species and geographic regions, offering a promising new tool in the fight against lymphatic filariasis.
Researchers conducted a study to estimate the public health burden of rhodesiense sleeping sickness in Urambo District, Tanzania. The disease, also known as human African trypanosomiasis, is fatal if left untreated and is a major public health concern in affected communities. The study used data from 143 patients admitted to Kaliua Health Centre in 2004 and estimated the disease's burden in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and financial costs.

The study found that the DALY estimate for HAT in Urambo District was 215.7 (95% CI: 155.3-287.5) without age-weighting and 281.6 (95% CI: 209.1-362.6) with age-weighting. When under-reporting was included, the results were 622.5 (95% CI: 155.3-1098.9) and 978.9 (95% CI: 201.1-1870.8) respectively. The costs of treating the patients were estimated at US$ 15,514, with patients paying US$ 3,673 and the health services paying US$ 11,841. The study also estimated indirect non-medical costs for the patients at US$ 9,781.

The study highlights the significant burden of HAT on affected rural communities in Tanzania and emphasizes the need for location- and disease-specific burden estimates. The disease is severely neglected and often concentrated in certain locations, imposing a high burden on local health systems and communities. The study's findings are consistent with previous studies on other neglected diseases and zoonoses in Tanzania, which also show a high burden on local health systems and communities.
Scientists have been studying the Ngly1 gene in mice to understand its role in the body. Ngly1 is an enzyme that removes sugar molecules from proteins, a process called de-N-glycosylation. Mice without the Ngly1 gene (Ngly1-deficient mice) were found to be embryonic lethal, meaning they died in the womb. However, when the Engase gene, another enzyme involved in de-N-glycosylation, was also deleted, the lethality of the Ngly1-deficient mice was partially rescued. This suggests that Ngly1 and Engase work together to remove sugar molecules from proteins, and that their combined function is crucial for the development of the embryo.

Further research showed that mice without both Ngly1 and Engase genes (Ngly1/Engase-deficient mice) still exhibited severe symptoms, similar to those seen in humans with a deficiency of the Ngly1 gene. These symptoms included a range of developmental and physical abnormalities. The study also found that changing the genetic background of the Ngly1-deficient mice by crossing them with another strain of mice (ICR) could also partially rescue the lethality. However, the Ngly1-deficient mice in the mixed background still showed severe symptoms.

The results of this study suggest that Ngly1-deficient mice, with or without the Engase gene, could be used as a model to study the pathogenesis of NGLY1-deficiency in humans. The study also identifies Engase as a potential therapeutic target for this genetic disorder.
Researchers studied how gene expression noise affects spatial patterning in fruit fly embryos. They focused on the hunchback (hb) gene, which is activated by the Bicoid (Bcd) protein gradient. Gene regulation is subject to intrinsic noise, which can produce variable expression. To understand how noise is controlled, the researchers characterized the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output noise on hb promoter structure and transcriptional dynamics. They used a stochastic model of the hb promoter, varying the number and strength of Bcd and Hb binding sites. The model was fit to data from wild-type embryos, a self-regulation mutant, and lacZ reporter constructs with different portions of the hb promoter. The results showed that wild-type Hb output noise is primarily dependent on its own transcription and translation dynamics, rather than Bcd fluctuations. The study also found that the multiple Bcd binding sites in the hb promoter play a role in buffering noise. The model was robust to variations in Bcd binding site number across different fly species. The research identified specific ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb output noise, which are common features of many genes. These findings contribute to the understanding of the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development.
Researchers have studied the genetic legacy of Neanderthals in modern humans, finding that selection has removed Neanderthal alleles from the human population. To understand the strength and causes of this selection, scientists developed a new method to estimate the genome-wide average strength of selection and the density of selected sites. Using this method, they analyzed Neanderthal allele frequencies in modern humans and found that East Asians had higher initial levels of Neanderthal ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The study suggests that the bulk of purifying selection against Neanderthal ancestry is due to weakly deleterious alleles that were effectively neutral in Neanderthals but became selected against after entering human populations of larger effective size. These alleles, individually of small effect, imposed a significant genetic load on early-generation human-Neanderthal hybrids. The research indicates that differences in effective population size may play a more significant role in shaping levels of introgression than previously thought. The study's findings enhance our understanding of how selection shaped the genomic contribution of Neanderthals to modern human genomes and shed light on the nature of Neanderthal-human hybridization. The results also suggest that nearly neutral dynamics and differences in effective population size may be key factors in determining levels of introgression across species and along the genome.
Researchers studied how the HIV virus controls its own gene expression after it has integrated into a host cell's genome. They found that the virus's promoter, a region of DNA that regulates gene expression, plays a crucial role in determining whether the virus is active or inactive. The promoter contains specific sequences called Sp1 and NF-κB elements that recruit host cell proteins to either activate or repress viral gene expression. The researchers created mutant versions of the HIV virus with altered Sp1 and NF-κB elements and used various techniques to study how these changes affected viral gene expression. They found that the Sp1 elements stabilize both the active and inactive states of the virus, while the NF-κB elements have distinct roles in activating or repressing gene expression. The researchers also found that mutations in the Sp1 elements increased the frequency of a phenomenon called clonal bifurcation, where a single cell population splits into two distinct subpopulations with different levels of viral gene expression. This suggests that the Sp1 elements help to "dampen" transcriptional noise, or random fluctuations in gene expression, which can contribute to the establishment and maintenance of viral latency. These findings have implications for the treatment of HIV latency, a state in which the virus remains dormant in the host cell, making it difficult to target with antiretroviral therapy.
Researchers compared the accuracy of nine leading orthology projects and methods, including COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNOG, and OMA, as well as two standard methods, bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance. The study aimed to evaluate their performance in identifying orthologs, which are genes in different species that have evolved from a common ancestral gene. The researchers used six different tests to compare the projects' predictions with respect to both phylogeny and function. The results showed that OMA and Homologene performed best in phylogenetic analysis and functional analysis with high specificity. At lower functional specificity but higher coverage, OrthoMCL outperformed Ensembl Compara and Inparanoid. EggNOG provided the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories, but was not specific enough for phylogenetic or detailed function analyses. The study also found that standard bidirectional best-hit often outperformed projects with more complex algorithms. The findings provide guidance for users of orthology data and introduce new methodology for verifying orthology. The study sets performance standards for current and future approaches, highlighting the importance of accurate ortholog prediction for applications such as protein annotation and phylogenetic analysis.
Researchers have identified new potential treatments for schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection that affects millions of people worldwide. The current treatment, praziquantel, has been in use for 40 years and is showing signs of resistance. To find new treatments, scientists used a computational approach to repurpose existing drugs. They focused on protein kinases, which play a crucial role in the parasite's biology. By analyzing the kinomes of the three main species of Schistosoma that infect humans, the researchers identified potential targets and existing drugs that could be effective against the parasites. They found that several kinase inhibitors, including bosutinib, dasatinib, and imatinib, could be repurposed as schistosomicidal agents. Additionally, they identified 22 new potential targets, including CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAKA, and MEK1. The researchers also suggested primary and secondary targets in Schistosoma for these approved drugs, paving the way for the development of new therapeutics. This study demonstrates the potential of computational drug repurposing as a strategy for finding new treatments for neglected tropical diseases like schistosomiasis.
Researchers studied how the pKID domain of the transcription factor CREB folds and binds to the KIX domain of the co-activator CBP. The pKID domain is known to be unstructured when not bound to a target, suggesting that folding and binding occur together. However, the study found that folding into a two-helix structure occurs mostly after binding, with the transition state structure of pKID closely resembling the unfolded state. The researchers used a computer model to simulate the binding process and found that the binding transition state resembles the unstructured state in solution, implying that CREB becomes structured only after committing to binding. This is in contrast to models where binding occurs to pre-structured conformations that exist in the unbound state at equilibrium. The study also found that increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pKID reduces the rate of binding, suggesting a "fly-casting" process. The inclusion of attractive non-native interactions resulted in the formation of non-specific encounter complexes that enhance the on-rate of binding, but do not significantly change the binding mechanism. The study's findings are in agreement with a recent nuclear magnetic resonance study and provide insight into how being unstructured can confer an advantage in protein target recognition.
A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity of infection among children in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) countries and territories was conducted to assess the progress towards a regional elimination goal. The study analyzed 132 articles published between 1942 and 2014, which provided 1,242 prevalence and 199 intensity of infection data points. The majority of the data came from Brazil, where several "hot spots" with high prevalence were identified. The review found that Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia need to update their national programs to target the elimination of Schistosoma mansoni transmission by 2020. In contrast, Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up surveys are needed to verify this status. The review also highlighted the need for improved reporting and standardization of monitoring and evaluation methodologies used in schistosomiasis programs. Meeting the regional elimination goal will require additional and improved epidemiological data by age group and sex. Schistosomiasis is a significant public health problem, with over 200 million people infected and 700 million at risk globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established guidelines for verification of elimination, which include reaching a prevalence of severe intensity of infection of less than 5% and 1%, respectively.
Researchers studied how HIV-1 subtype C is transmitted from one person to another through heterosexual contact. They analyzed 167 near full-length viral genomes and created 40 infectious molecular clones from six linked transmission pairs. These clones included the transmitted/founder (TF) variant, which is the single viral variant selected during most transmission events, and multiple non-transmitted (NT) HIV-1 variants from the same transmission pairs.

The study found that the TF variants did not have increased viral fitness in terms of particle infectivity or viral replicative capacity in immune cells. Additionally, the TF variants were not more resistant to the antiviral effects of interferon-α (IFN-α) compared to the NT variants from the same transmission pairs. This suggests that neither in vitro viral replicative capacity nor IFN-α resistance can predict the transmission potential of viruses in the quasispecies of chronically infected individuals.

The study's findings support the hypothesis that within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to adaptive immune responses reduces viral transmission potential. The researchers also found that heterosexual HIV-1 transmission is permissive to viruses with a range of IFN-α resistance profiles, indicating that factors other than IFN-α resistance are the dominant determinants of transmission fitness in these pairs. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of HIV-1 transmission and may lead to new targets for intervention.
Filarial parasites, which cause diseases such as lymphatic filariasis and elephantiasis, have been found to directly influence the lymphatic system in the body. In a recent study, researchers exposed human lymphatic endothelial cells to filarial antigens, live parasites, or serum from infected patients to understand how these parasites affect the lymphatic system. The results showed that live filarial parasites or their antigens triggered the growth and differentiation of lymphatic endothelial cells into tube-like structures. This process, known as lymphangiogenesis, is a key aspect of the development of lymphatic filariasis.

The study also found that serum from patients with lymphatic filariasis promoted the growth of lymphatic endothelial cells, while serum from uninfected individuals did not. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that filarial parasites altered the expression of genes involved in cellular organization and development, as well as those associated with junction adherence pathways. This led to a decrease in the transport of substances across the lymphatic endothelial cells.

The findings suggest that filarial parasites directly induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic differentiation, providing new insights into the mechanisms underlying the pathology of lymphatic filariasis. The study's results also highlight the importance of understanding the direct interactions between filarial parasites and the lymphatic system in the development of the disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to extract and amplify the genetic material from single bacterial cells. This method, called Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA), allows for the creation of enough DNA for sequencing without the need to culture the bacteria in a lab. A microfluidic device was used to isolate individual Escherichia coli cells and amplify their DNA using MDA in tiny 60-nanoliter reactions. The results showed that reducing the reaction volume from microliters to nanoliters improved the quality of the genome amplification and reduced bias in the data. This means that all parts of the genome were represented more evenly, providing a more accurate picture of the cell's genetic makeup. The amplified DNA was then sequenced using a high-throughput method called pyrosequencing, which produced high-quality sequence data. This new method has the potential to greatly facilitate the study of microbial ecology and evolution, as it allows researchers to analyze the genetic material of microorganisms that cannot be grown in a lab. The results also suggest that using smaller reaction volumes can improve the specificity of the amplification process, making it a promising approach for single-cell sequencing applications. Overall, this study demonstrates a straightforward route to sequencing genomes from single cells, which could have significant implications for our understanding of the microbial world.
Researchers studied the relationship between hantavirus-carrying rodents and human disease in the Atlantic Forest of South America. They analyzed data from 283 rodent captures and found that the proportion of hantavirus hosts in rodent communities is influenced by landscape diversity and local small mammal diversity. Specifically, areas with a mix of agricultural land and forest remnants had a higher proportion of hantavirus hosts. In contrast, areas with high levels of deforestation did not have a significant impact on the proportion of hantavirus hosts.

The study also found that the presence of sugarcane and tree plantations increased the proportion of rodent hosts, while local small mammal diversity had a positive effect on the proportion of hantavirus hosts. However, defaunation, or the loss of native species, did not have a significant impact on the proportion of hantavirus hosts. The researchers also found that the spatial match between hantavirus host hotspots and human disease vulnerability was relatively low, at 17%.

The study suggests that disease surveillance should be reinforced in the southern and southeastern regions of the Atlantic Forest, where the highest predicted hantavirus host proportion and levels of vulnerability spatially match. The findings also indicate that there may be more complex rodent community dynamics and interactions with human disease than previously thought. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering landscape diversity and local small mammal diversity in understanding the spread of hantavirus disease in the Atlantic Forest.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called BCLXL plays a crucial role in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. Flaviviruses are a family of viruses that can cause severe diseases in humans. The study found that BCLXL helps infected cells survive by suppressing the expression of another protein called MCL1, which is involved in cell death. When BCLXL is inhibited or deficient, cells infected with flaviviruses undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which helps to reduce the spread of the virus.

The researchers also found that flavivirus infection impairs protein synthesis in infected cells, leading to a decrease in short-lived proteins like MCL1. Inhibiting BCLXL increased the phagocytosis of infected cells by immune cells called macrophages, which helps to suppress the spread of the virus and reduce inflammation.

The study suggests that BCLXL is a critical factor in the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses and may provide a novel target for antiviral therapy. The researchers propose a model to explain how BCLXL regulates the balance between cell survival and death in response to flavivirus infection. They also found that inhibiting BCLXL increased the survival rate of mice infected with Japanese encephalitis virus and reduced inflammation.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of flavivirus infection and identifies BCLXL as a potential target for the development of antiviral therapies.
A recent study estimated the economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam from 2005 to 2014. The study found that the total economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam over the 10-year period was over $719 million USD. The majority of this cost, 92%, was attributed to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), a treatment given to people who have been bitten or exposed to rabies. The study also estimated that canine rabies resulted in between 36,560 and 45,700 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), which is a measure of the impact of a disease on a person's quality of life. Additionally, the study reported 914 human deaths due to rabies during the study period.

The study found that the cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75 USD, indicating that investing in dog vaccination is a cost-effective way to control canine rabies. The results of this study are consistent with the economic burden of canine rabies in other Asian countries, where large expenditures are made on PEP and minimal investments are made in dog vaccination. The study highlights the need for coordinated veterinary public health campaigns to prevent human rabies through dog vaccination, rather than relying solely on PEP administration. Overall, the study provides valuable insights into the economic impact of canine rabies in Viet Nam and underscores the importance of investing in dog vaccination to control the disease.
Scientists have discovered a crucial component of the Type II Secretion System (T2SS), a molecular machine that helps bacteria secrete proteins across their outer membrane. The T2SS consists of a secretin, a protein that forms a pore in the outer membrane, and a pilotin, a protein that helps assemble the secretin into the membrane. Researchers have identified three distinct forms of T2SS based on the characteristics of their secretins. Two of these forms, the Klebsiella-type and Vibrio-type, were found to have different pilotins that mediate their transport and assembly.

A novel pilotin called AspS was discovered in Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that causes cholera. The researchers determined the crystal structure of AspS and found that it is structurally unrelated to other pilotins, but functionally equivalent. AspS binds to a specific sequence in the Vibrio-type secretin and enhances the assembly of the secretin into the outer membrane. The researchers also found that homologs of AspS are present in all species of Vibrio, as well as in some strains of Escherichia and Shigella that have acquired a Vibrio-type T2SS.

The discovery of AspS provides new insights into the assembly of the T2SS and the evolution of bacterial secretion systems. The researchers suggest that some bacteria may have acquired a complete functional unit of secretin-pilotin-substrate that can be incorporated into the T2SS operon. This finding has implications for our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.
Researchers have identified a protein called OmpL37 on the surface of Leptospira bacteria that causes leptospirosis, a disease spread through contact with contaminated water. This protein binds to a protein called elastin, which is found in human skin and blood vessels. The study found that OmpL37 has a strong affinity for elastin, making it easier for the bacteria to attach to host tissues. This attachment is a crucial step in the infection process, allowing the bacteria to spread and colonize the body.

The researchers used an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to test the binding of OmpL37 to various host tissue components. They found that OmpL37 binds not only to elastin but also to other proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrinogen fragment D, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. The binding of OmpL37 to elastin was enhanced by antibodies produced by the host in response to the infection, suggesting that these antibodies may actually aid the bacteria in attaching to elastin-rich tissues.

The study also found that OmpL37 is recognized by the immune system of infected animals and humans, indicating that it is a target for the host's immune response. The researchers propose that OmpL37 may play a role in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis by facilitating the attachment of Leptospira to host tissues. Further investigation is needed to fully understand the role of OmpL37 in the infection process.
Researchers have studied two broadly neutralizing antibodies, 4E10 and 2F5, which recognize a specific region of the HIV-1 virus called the membrane proximal external region (MPER). These antibodies are polyreactive, meaning they bind to both the viral membrane and their epitopes in the MPER. A model was developed to calculate the probability of these antibodies disabling a gp41 trimer after T cell-HIV adhesion. The model shows that for 4E10 and 2F5 to be effective at neutralizing the virus, the time it takes to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the antibody remains bound in a stable conformation, which is about five minutes or less. The study found that 2F5 IgG is more effective at neutralization than its Fab fragment, likely due to its ability to interact more stably with the viral membrane. The model also predicts that only a small number of gp41 bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion. However, the exact number cannot be determined from neutralization experiments alone. The study aims to understand the parameters that determine the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and proposes an extension of the model to analyze neutralization data.
Researchers conducted a long-term study in Mali and Senegal to determine if mass treatment with ivermectin could eliminate onchocerciasis, a parasitic disease spread by blackflies, in areas where the disease is highly prevalent. The study involved 15 to 17 years of annual or six-monthly ivermectin treatment in three highly endemic areas. After the final treatment, the researchers monitored the levels of infection and transmission for up to five years. They collected skin snip samples from over 29,000 people and analyzed over 492,000 blackflies for the presence of Onchocerca volvulus larvae.

The results showed a decline in infection and transmission levels after the last treatment. In two of the study sites, the prevalence of microfilariae and vector infectivity rate were zero three to four years after the last treatment. In the third site, where infection levels were initially higher, there was also a significant decline in infection and transmission to very low levels three to five years after stopping treatment. The study found that all infection and transmission indicators were below the thresholds for elimination.

The study provides proof of principle that onchocerciasis elimination with ivermectin treatment is feasible in some endemic areas in Africa. The results have informed the shift from onchocerciasis control to elimination efforts in Africa. The researchers recommend that future treatment projects in areas with different vector species or high pre-control endemicity levels proceed with caution when stopping treatment, using a similar methodology to the study, including detailed epidemiological and entomological evaluations for three years after treatment cessation.
Researchers have been trying to understand how non-enveloped viruses, such as the human rhinovirus, deliver their genetic material into cells without fusing with the cell membrane. The human rhinovirus is a common cause of the common cold and is part of the picornavirus family, which includes other significant pathogens like poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. A small protein called VP4 is released from the virus and interacts with the cell membrane, helping to deliver the viral RNA genome into the cell. To study this process, scientists created a version of the VP4 protein and found that it can make the cell membrane permeable, allowing certain molecules to pass through. Using various techniques, they showed that VP4 forms a multimeric pore, or a group of proteins that work together to create a channel, in the cell membrane. This pore is size-selective, meaning it only allows certain molecules to pass through, and is consistent with the size of the viral RNA genome. The researchers also found that the permeability induced by VP4 is influenced by the pH of the environment and is similar to the permeability caused by the actual virus. These findings provide a new understanding of how VP4 helps the virus enter cells and suggest that it could be a potential target for antiviral treatments.
Researchers have identified a mutant strain of Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, which elicits a protective immune response in mice. The mutant strain lacks the ability to add galactosamine and/or mannose to its lipid A molecule, a key component of the bacterial cell wall. This modification is crucial for the bacterium's virulence and ability to evade the host's immune system. The researchers found that mice infected with the mutant strain produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and macrophage inhibitory protein-2, compared to those infected with the wild-type strain. This immune response was mediated by the MyD88 signaling pathway, a key component of the innate immune system. The researchers also found that mice infected with the mutant strain were protected against subsequent infection with the wild-type strain, suggesting that the mutant strain can induce protective immunity. The study suggests that carbohydrate modifications of lipid A play a crucial role in bacterial virulence and that targeting these modifications could lead to the development of an effective vaccine against Francisella tularensis. The researchers propose that inactivating the flmK gene, which is responsible for adding galactosamine and/or mannose to lipid A, in other Francisella subspecies could also result in bacterial attenuation and activation of adaptive immunity.
Researchers studied the role of Era, a protein involved in ribosome assembly, in the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. They found that Era is not essential for the growth of S. aureus, but is important for the assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit. Era interacts with other proteins, including the 16S rRNA endonuclease YbeY and the DEAD-box RNA helicase CshA, which are involved in rRNA processing and degradation. These interactions are crucial for the growth of S. aureus at low temperatures. Era also interacts with the (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase RelSau, which negatively affects the helicase activity of CshA. The researchers propose that Era acts as a hub protein on the ribosome, directing enzymes involved in rRNA processing and ribosome subunit assembly to their site of action. The stringent response, which is triggered by the production of (p)ppGpp, can impede this activity, contributing to the slowed growth phenotype associated with this stress response pathway. The study provides new insights into the complex dynamics of ribosome assembly and the role of Era in this process. Further research is needed to fully understand the interactions between Era, YbeY, CshA, and RelSau and their impact on ribosomal maturation.
Researchers studied the effects of anthrax lethal toxin (LT) on mice and found that the heart is an early target of the toxin. They discovered that mice lacking the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were more sensitive to the toxin than mice with normal levels of nNOS. This suggests that nNOS plays a protective role against LT-mediated cardiac damage. The study found that nNOS-deficient mice showed significant changes in heart morphology, including the formation of new spaces between heart muscle fibers, but no cell death. In contrast, mice with normal levels of nNOS showed no histopathological changes at the light microscopy level. However, electron microscopy revealed similar pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS-deficient and normal mice, but with varying severity and timing. The study also found that multiple biomarkers of cardiac injury were elevated in both nNOS-deficient and normal mice after LT treatment. The researchers tested various treatments, including cardiac protective nitrite therapy and allopurinol, but found no beneficial effects. However, a potent nitric oxide scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, showed some protective effect against LT. Echocardiography revealed a decrease in heart function in both nNOS-deficient and normal mice after LT treatment. The study suggests that the heart is an early target of LT and that nNOS plays a protective role against cardiac damage caused by the toxin.
Scientists have developed a new method to edit the genes of parasitic nematodes, a type of worm that infects over 1 billion people worldwide. These parasites cause some of the most common neglected tropical diseases, but their biology has been difficult to study due to the lack of tools for genetic intervention. The new method uses a technique called CRISPR-Cas9, which allows for targeted gene disruptions and mutant phenotypes in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis. By disrupting the twitchin gene unc-22, researchers were able to create nematodes with severe motility defects, such as decreased movement and twitching. The mutations were also heritable, meaning they were passed down to the nematodes' offspring. The same method was also applied to the rat-parasitic nematode Strongyloides ratti, demonstrating the applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 to parasitic nematodes. This breakthrough enables future studies of gene function in these medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites. The researchers used the complex life cycle of S. stercoralis to deliver the CRISPR-Cas9 constructs into free-living adults, and characterized the mutations in the nematodes' offspring. The study provides a practical method for targeted gene disruptions in parasitic nematodes, opening up new avenues for research into the biology and treatment of these parasites.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the effects of ribosome drop-off on protein translation in cells. Ribosome drop-off is a phenomenon where ribosomes, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis, prematurely terminate translation. This can occur under stress conditions, such as amino acid starvation or high levels of recombinant protein expression. The model shows that ribosome drop-off can lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, where the density of ribosomes increases from the 5' to the 3' end of the mRNA. Importantly, the model predicts that the effects of ribosome drop-off on translation rates are mRNA-specific, and that some mRNAs are more resilient to drop-off than others.

The model reveals that mRNAs that can sustain a queue of ribosomes are less affected by ribosome drop-off, while those that cannot sustain a queue are more affected. Additionally, the model shows that mRNAs with higher translation rates are more resilient to ribosome drop-off. This is consistent with a genome-wide analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which found that mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off. In contrast, mRNAs coding for regulatory and stress-related proteins are less resilient to ribosome drop-off. The model provides a tool to analyze variations in translational efficiency of individual mRNAs and explains mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.
Researchers are exploring alternative strategies to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections, which affect millions of children worldwide. The World Health Organization's current approach involves routine deworming of school and pre-school aged children, but this strategy may not be effective in the long term due to persistent reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and the environment. To accelerate the interruption of transmission, mass drug administration (MDA) is being considered. However, sustaining high MDA coverage levels across entire communities is a challenge. The DeWorm3 trial aims to test the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission using MDA. In this study, researchers used a simulation model to investigate whether criteria can be defined to determine whether transmission interruption is unlikely at earlier timepoints. The model simulated the DeWorm3 community-based cluster-randomized trial, comparing a control arm with annual treatment of children alone with MDA and an intervention arm with community-wide biannual treatment with MDA. The results suggest that all clusters should be assessed for transmission interruption after two years of surveillance, unless transmission interruption can be effectively ruled out through evidence of low treatment coverage. The study found that a tight range of homogeneous prevalence estimates following high coverage MDA across clusters does not allow for discrimination between bounce-back or transmission interruption within 24 months following cessation of MDA.
Researchers have developed a conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholerae O1 (Ogawa) O-Specific Polysaccharide (OSP) and a recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain fragment (TThc). The vaccine, called OSP:TThc, was tested in mice to evaluate its ability to induce protective immunity against cholera. The study found that mice immunized with OSP:TThc developed significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP after a single immunization, and anti-LPS IgG responses after a second immunization. In contrast, mice that received un-conjugated OSP or immunoadjuvant alone did not develop any anti-OSP or anti-LPS IgG responses. The study also found that administration of OSP:TThc with adjuvant induced memory B cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge model. This suggests that the conjugate vaccine is protectively immunogenic and could help induce long-term protective immunity, particularly in young children who respond poorly to polysaccharide antigens. The researchers believe that the core oligosaccharide does not contribute significantly to the protective immunity observed, as previous infection with V. cholerae O1 does not provide protection from V. cholerae O139 and vice versa. The study's findings support the development of a cholera conjugate vaccine as a potential tool for preventing cholera, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year.
Researchers have discovered that the fungus Candida albicans can inhibit the virulence of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the gut. In a study using mice with weakened immune systems, Candida albicans was found to suppress the production of two key molecules, pyochelin and pyoverdine, which are essential for Pseudomonas aeruginosa's ability to cause disease. This suppression of pyochelin and pyoverdine led to a decrease in Pseudomonas aeruginosa's virulence, or its ability to cause harm. The researchers found that Candida albicans secreted proteins were responsible for this inhibition, and that these proteins were sufficient to reduce Pseudomonas aeruginosa's virulence in mice.

The study also showed that iron supplementation restored Pseudomonas aeruginosa's virulence in mice colonized by both Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This suggests that the suppression of pyochelin and pyoverdine production by Candida albicans is related to the availability of iron in the gut. The researchers propose that Candida albicans secreted proteins may modulate the host's oxidative stress response, leading to changes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa's virulence. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between different microorganisms in the gut and highlights the potential for Candida albicans to modulate Pseudomonas aeruginosa's virulence.
Researchers studied the behavior of a virus that has mutated to evade the immune system's CD8 T cells, which play a key role in fighting off infections. This "escape mutant" (EM) virus is less fit than the original virus and often reverts back to its original form when transmitted to a new host. However, the rate and timing of this reversion can vary greatly. The study used a sensitive PCR assay to track the reversion of EM viruses in pigtail macaques infected with a mix of EM and wild-type (WT) viruses. The results showed that when the mix contained at least 10% WT virus, the WT virus rapidly outgrew the EM virus within 7 days. In contrast, when the mix contained smaller proportions of WT virus, the reversion was delayed, taking up to 8 weeks for the WT virus to become dominant. This delayed reversion was associated with lower viral loads. The study found that the diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT virus, which in turn predicts the outcome of infection. The findings suggest that in some cases, the delay in reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 T cell escape mutations may reduce the pathogenicity of the virus during early infection. The study's results have implications for understanding the dynamics of HIV and SIV infections and may provide opportunities to reduce the pathogenicity of the virus during early infection.
Researchers studied yeast populations in Evolution Canyon, Israel, and found that some strains have a high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium. They discovered that this resistance is primarily due to an enhanced function of a metal efflux pump called PCA1. The team found that mutations in the PCA1 promoter sequence are responsible for this enhancement, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments showed that three specific nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter increase its activity and enhance cadmium resistance. These nucleotides are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other yeast species, suggesting they represent an ancestral type. However, in most Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, these nucleotides have diverged, giving cells a growth advantage under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. The study provides a rare example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance. The findings suggest that the spread of a weak PCA1 allele in most S. cerevisiae populations is due to a tradeoff between metal resistance and fitness under low cadmium conditions. This tradeoff allows cells to maintain a certain level of cadmium efflux activity without compromising their fitness under normal conditions.
Researchers have identified three major oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer (GC) that are linked to patient survival. These pathways, known as proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin, are deregulated in more than 70% of GC cases. The study used gene expression signatures to map patterns of oncogenic pathway activation in 301 primary gastric cancers, which is the second leading cause of global cancer mortality.

The researchers developed an in silico method to predict the activation levels of different pathways in primary tumor profiles and validated this approach using breast cancer data. They then applied this method to GC, evaluating 11 oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways previously implicated in gastric carcinogenesis. The study found that individual GCs can be classified into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups based on their oncogenic pathway activity.

Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway combinations showed significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting that pathway interactions play a crucial role in influencing disease behavior. The study's findings suggest that predicting pathway activity by expression signatures allows for the study of multiple cancer-related pathways interacting simultaneously in primary cancers, which is not currently achievable by other platforms. This approach has the potential to improve our understanding of GC and may lead to the development of more effective treatment strategies.
Researchers analyzed the DNA structure of the Escherichia coli K12 genome to understand how it responds to stress. They used a method called stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) to identify areas where the DNA is more likely to unwind under stress. The study found that these areas are often located near genes that control gene expression, particularly those involved in responding to environmental and physiological changes. The researchers discovered that genes encoding transcriptional regulators, such as activators and repressors, are more likely to have strongly destabilized regions near their start sites. This suggests that superhelical duplex destabilization may play a role in regulating gene expression in response to environmental changes. The study also found that this association between SIDD sites and transcriptional regulators is not unique to E. coli K12, but is a common feature of many free-living bacteria. In contrast, endosymbionts and obligate parasitic bacteria do not show this association. The researchers propose that SIDD sites near transcriptional regulators may be involved in mediating the adaptive transcriptional response to environmental changes. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation in prokaryotes and highlights the importance of superhelical duplex destabilization in controlling gene expression. The findings have implications for our understanding of how bacteria adapt to changing environments and respond to stress.
Researchers studied the role of HMG-box transcription factors in the fungus Podospora anserina, a type of fungus that reproduces sexually. They found that 11 out of 12 HMG-box genes are involved in the sexual cycle of the fungus. One of these genes, PaHMG5, plays a central role in regulating mating-type genes, which control fertilization and fruit-body development. PaHMG5 is similar to a gene called SpSte11 found in a different type of fungus, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, despite the two species diverging 550 million years ago. The researchers also found that another HMG-box gene, PaHMG9, acts as a repressor of certain processes that occur during the stationary phase of the fungus's life cycle. The study revealed a network of HMG-box genes that regulate mating-type genes and fertility genes in Podospora anserina. This network is similar to a module of HMG-box genes found in mammals, which play a role in sex determination. The findings provide new insights into the role of HMG-box genes in the sexual cycle of fungi and highlight the conservation of sex regulation mechanisms between animals and fungi.
In response to the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic, an observational cohort study was conducted in Sierra Leone to investigate the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids. The study aimed to address the urgent need for data on the potential risk of transmission, including sexual transmission, from survivors. Prior to the epidemic, limited data was available on the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids.

The study was implemented in two phases. The first phase, initiated within five months of initial protocol discussions, assessed the persistence of Ebola virus in the semen of 100 adult men. The second phase, which began shortly after, evaluated the persistence of the virus in multiple body fluids, including semen, vaginal fluid, menstrual blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, and tears, in 120 men and 120 women.

The study found that Ebola virus was detectable in body fluids for a longer period than previously thought, with the virus persisting in semen for up to 565 days. The study's findings informed national and global guidelines, leading to the implementation of semen testing programs among EVD survivors in affected countries. The study's tools and lessons learned also accelerated the implementation of such programs and informed studies on the persistence of other viruses, such as Zika virus. The study highlights the importance of rapid research in responding to epidemics and the need for adequate resources to answer critical research questions.
Researchers have developed a method to predict the chemical environments that bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, typically encounter in their natural habitats. They used in vivo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and information theory to analyze the chemotaxis sensory system of E. coli. This system allows the bacteria to detect and migrate in chemical gradients of nutrients and toxins. The researchers found that the bacteria typically encounter exponential gradients in their natural environment, which leads to log-normal stimuli and maximal drift velocity. They used a multidisciplinary approach, combining FRET measurements, information theory, and simulations of swimming bacteria, to show that maximizing mutual information implies maximizing the alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient. This suggests that the chemotaxis sensory system has evolved to maintain perception in exponential gradients. The study provides a first step towards deciphering the chemical nature of complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular microenvironments, such as the human intestine. The researchers' model connects phenomenological laws, such as Weber's law and the Weber-Fechner law, with information theory at the molecular level, providing a new understanding of the relationship between information transmission and drift in bacterial chemotaxis.
Researchers studied the lifespan of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which are responsible for producing blood cells throughout a person's life. HSCs were thought to have an indefinite lifespan due to their ability to self-renew, but studies have shown that genetically identical HSCs can have different lifespans. A new model, based on reliability theory, was developed to explain this diversity. The model suggests that small-scale failures in HSCs are dissipated at the population level through repair processes. However, the repair capacity of HSCs is self-limiting, and a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior occurs, leading to rapid clonal extinction. The lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure rate kinetics. Shorter and longer-lived HSCs differ significantly in their pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations. This suggests that the lifespan of HSCs is determined by pre-programmed differences in repair capacity. The study's findings have implications for understanding aging in HSCs and other non-homogenous cell systems. The researchers used clonal repopulation experiments and computational-mathematical modeling to test the reliability theory model and found that it best fits the experimental data. The study's approach does not depend on specific failure sources and repair mechanisms, making it a useful tool for interpreting longitudinal network data.
Antibodies play a crucial role in protecting against chronic helminth infections, which affect approximately one-third of the world's population. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these large multicellular parasites were not well understood. Researchers have discovered that helminth-specific antibodies can trap tissue-migrating helminth larvae and prevent tissue damage by activating macrophages, a type of immune cell. This process occurs independently of the IL-4 receptor alpha chain (IL-4Rα), a signaling pathway previously linked to alternative activation of macrophages during helminth infection.

The study found that mice lacking antibodies or activating Fc receptors had highly motile larvae, extensive tissue damage, and fewer macrophages expressing Arginase-1, an enzyme involved in wound healing. In contrast, helminth-specific antibodies induced FcRγ- and complement-dependent adherence of macrophages to larvae, resulting in complete larval immobilization. The study also showed that antibodies reprogrammed macrophages to express wound-healing associated genes, including Arginase-1, which directly impaired larval motility.

The researchers identified a novel subtype of alternatively activated macrophages, referred to as helminth-antibody activated macrophages (HAAM), which are activated by antibodies in the presence of helminth antigens. These HAAM cells upregulate Arginase-1 and immobilize infective and tissue-dwelling larvae. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of antibody-mediated immunity against helminths and highlights the importance of antibodies in regulating macrophage function during type 2 immune responses.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how living cells repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), a major threat to genome integrity. The method, called ParB-INT, uses protein oligomerization to form visible foci without interfering with the repair process. This allows for the first real-time analysis of resection in single living cells. The study focused on the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and observed the dynamics of a chromatin locus next to a DSB. The results showed that the damaged chromatin region is transiently confined during the early steps of resection, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. The study also found that resection in a yku70 mutant began about 10 minutes earlier than in wild-type cells, defining this as the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. Furthermore, the new method revealed a distinct phase of confinement of chromatin neighboring the DSB early in the resection period. The ParB-INT system allows for direct kinetic measurements on single cells without interfering with the process, making it widely applicable to the study of fine-scale chromosome positioning and dynamics in various contexts, such as gene expression, replication, and recombination. The study provides new insights into the dynamics and mechanism of resection and has the potential to be used in the analysis of genome organization, dynamics, and function in normal and pathological contexts.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to study the transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in humans. They used the model to estimate the frequency and timing of reinfections in people living in areas where the disease is common. The model was based on data from two villages in Argentina where 56% of the population had mixed infections with different genotypes of the parasite. The results showed that people in these areas are likely to be reinfected with T. cruzi at a rate of 0.032 per year, with most reinfections occurring during the chronic stage of the disease. The model also suggested that the parasite can evade the immune system in at least 20% of reinfection events. As a result, the risk of reinfection during the chronic stage of the disease is estimated to be around 14% after 5 years and 60% after 30 years, with most individuals being reinfected 1-3 times overall. The study found that the low rate of reinfections is more likely due to the inefficient transmission of the parasite through the feces of infected triatomine bugs (stercorarian mode) rather than a strong immune response. These findings have implications for the development of vaccines and our understanding of the increased risk of chronic disease manifestations in people living in endemic areas.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to dengue virus infection in a group of school-aged children in Thailand. They collected blood samples from the children before and after they were infected with dengue virus. The samples were then tested for 30 different cytokines, which are signaling molecules that help the immune system fight off infections. The results showed that children who developed symptoms of dengue infection had different cytokine profiles compared to those who did not develop symptoms. Specifically, children who developed symptoms had higher levels of certain cytokines, such as IL-15 and MCP-1, and lower levels of others, such as IL-12 and IL-2R. In contrast, children who did not develop symptoms had higher levels of cytokines like IL-6. These findings suggest that there may be two types of immune responses to dengue virus infection: a protective response that prevents symptoms and a pathologic response that leads to severe disease. The study's results may help researchers understand why some people develop severe dengue infection while others do not, and could potentially be used to evaluate the effectiveness of dengue vaccines. The study also highlights the importance of pre-existing immune profiles in determining the outcome of dengue infection, and suggests that certain cytokines, such as IL-6, may play a key role in dengue disease pathogenesis.
Researchers have re-examined the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling in the development of the Drosophila wing disc. Traditionally, Hh has been viewed as a classical morphogen, a molecule that controls patterning by acting at a distance to regulate gene expression in a concentration-dependent manner. However, a direct correspondence between the borders of gene expression patterns and Hh concentration thresholds has not been demonstrated. This study provides evidence that the interpretation of Hh signaling depends on the history of exposure to Hh and proposes that a single concentration threshold is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Using mathematical modeling, the researchers predict that at steady state, only two domains can be defined in response to Hh, suggesting that the boundaries of two or more gene expression patterns cannot be specified by a static Hh gradient. Computer simulations suggest that a spatial "overshoot" of the Hh gradient occurs, a transient state in which the Hh profile is expanded compared to the Hh steady-state gradient. This overshoot is thought to result from the Hh-dependent up-regulation of the receptor, Patched (Ptc). The study's results support a model in which Hh gradient dynamics, resulting from Ptc up-regulation, play an instructional role in the establishment of patterns of gene expression. The findings suggest a new model of pattern formation that takes into consideration gradient dynamics to explain Hh-dependent patterning of the wing disc.
Researchers have identified a gene called unc-79 in mice that plays a crucial role in how the nervous system responds to ethanol and anesthetics. A mutation in this gene, known as Lightweight (Lwt), causes mice to be more sensitive to the effects of ethanol and anesthetics, such as isoflurane. This sensitivity is similar to what has been observed in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which also has an unc-79 gene. The researchers found that mice with the Lwt mutation are more active, eat more food, and have a leaner body composition compared to normal mice. They also voluntarily consume more ethanol than normal mice. The study suggests that the unc-79 gene is part of a conserved pathway that may influence alcohol-related behaviors in humans. This pathway is thought to regulate the activity of a leak channel in the nervous system, which is important for determining sensitivity to ethanol. The findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms by which ethanol and anesthetics affect the nervous system and may have implications for understanding alcohol-related behaviors in humans. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and explore the role of the unc-79 gene in more detail.
Researchers have identified the Imd pathway as a key mechanism in the Anopheles gambiae mosquito's immune response against Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for human malaria. The Imd pathway is a conserved immune signaling pathway that has been shown to have potent anti-P. falciparum activity. By silencing the negative regulator of the Imd pathway, Caspar, or over-expressing the REL2 transcription factor, researchers were able to confer a resistant phenotype on A. gambiae mosquitoes. This involved the activation of an array of immune effector genes.

Further investigation revealed that the Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oocysts. The researchers also found that silencing Caspar alone was sufficient to induce a robust anti-P. falciparum response, even in the absence of resident gut microbiota. Additionally, they identified TEP1, APL1, and LRIM1 as key components of the Imd pathway that play a role in parasite infection intensity-dependent defense.

These findings highlight the potential of the Imd pathway as a target for malaria control strategies. However, the study also reveals nuances in the Imd-directed immune response against P. falciparum, emphasizing the need for thoughtful implementation of Imd pathway manipulation in A. gambiae to limit the malaria transmission cycle.
Researchers investigated the potential of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) to treat pulmonary fibrosis caused by a fungal infection called paracoccidioidomycosis. In this study, mice were infected with the fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis and then treated with BMMSCs or a combination of BMMSCs and an antifungal medication called itraconazole (ITC). The researchers found that the BMMSCs did not have an anti-fibrotic effect, meaning they did not prevent or reduce the scarring of lung tissue. In fact, the BMMSCs seemed to exacerbate the fibrosis, increasing the number of fibrocytes, a type of cell involved in scarring, and the production of collagen, a protein that contributes to scarring. The combination of BMMSCs and ITC, however, showed promising results, reducing the expression of certain genes involved in fibrosis. The researchers also found that lung tissue from infected mice treated with BMMSCs stimulated human fibroblasts to produce more collagen, suggesting that the BMMSCs may be interacting with the fungus in a way that promotes scarring. Overall, the study suggests that BMMSCs may not be an effective treatment for pulmonary fibrosis caused by paracoccidioidomycosis, but the combination of BMMSCs and ITC may be worth further investigation as a potential therapy.
A recent study investigated the seasonal dynamics of phlebotomine sand fly species that transmit Leishmania infantum, a parasite causing leishmaniasis, in the Mediterranean region. The study analyzed data from over 99,000 sand fly specimens collected from 37 sites in eight Mediterranean countries between 2011 and 2013. The results showed that the activity of sand flies is seasonal and sensitive to climate variations. The study found that the time of sand fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, and seasonal densities varied in each location. Significant correlations were found between latitude and mean annual temperature of sites and the first month of sand fly appearance, as well as the type of density trend. The study identified a 3-modal trend for P. tobbi in Cyprus, a novel finding for a L. infantum vector. Adult sand flies ended their activity from mid-September to November, without significant correlation with latitude or mean annual temperature. The period of potential exposure to L. infantum in the Mediterranean subregion was associated with a regular bell-shaped density curve, peaking in July-September and falling between early May and late October. The study found a common pattern of nocturnal female activity, peaking between 11 pm and 2 am, and identified a higher potential risk for L. infantum transmission in the June-October period, particularly in southern territories.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, which causes scrub typhus, interacts with human immune cells called monocytes. They found that O. tsutsugamushi can infect and replicate within monocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in the immune system. When monocytes were exposed to O. tsutsugamushi, the researchers observed a significant change in the expression of over 4,500 genes. This change included the upregulation of genes involved in the production of type I interferon, which is a protein that helps fight off viral infections, and genes associated with the M1 polarization of macrophages, a type of immune cell. The researchers also found that O. tsutsugamushi induced the expression of genes involved in apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in a small percentage of monocytes. These findings were similar to those observed in patients with scrub typhus, who showed upregulation of interferon-related genes and features of M1 polarization in their immune cells. The study suggests that the interaction between O. tsutsugamushi and monocytes is critical in the pathogenesis of scrub typhus, and that interferon-mediated activation of monocytes and their subsequent polarization into an M1 phenotype may play a key role in the disease. The study's findings may also provide new insights into the diagnosis and treatment of scrub typhus.
Researchers have long been fascinated by the ability of ants to navigate complex environments using visual memory. Despite their small brain size, ants can learn and remember extended routes through intricate landscapes. To understand how they achieve this, scientists have focused on the mushroom body, a crucial memory circuit in the insect brain. However, most studies have explored its function in simple olfactory association tasks, not complex visual learning.

A team of researchers took a different approach by using a spiking neural model originally developed to describe fruit fly olfactory learning. They applied this model to desert ants and found that it could account for the ants' ability to rapidly learn visual routes through complex natural environments. The model, which includes one-shot learning of sparse codes, enabled the researchers to estimate the theoretical storage capacity of the ant mushroom body to be hundreds of independent images.

The study demonstrates that the neural architecture of the ant mushroom body can implement a "familiarity" algorithm, which is essential for route following. The model learned over 80 on-route images, reconstructed from real ant viewpoints in their natural habitat, and reliably distinguished them from similar images obtained when looking off-route. Notably, the network required minimal modification to perform this complex function, suggesting that the ant mushroom body is capable of supporting navigation under realistic conditions.
Plants have an innate immune system to protect themselves from disease, but they also have unique defense mechanisms, such as the ability to replace damaged organs with new ones. Researchers studied how Arabidopsis, a type of plant, responds to bacterial infection by shedding its cauline leaves. They found that when Arabidopsis is infected with the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae, it sheds its cauline leaves as a defense mechanism. This response is triggered by the bacterium's effectors, which are proteins that help the bacterium infect the plant. The researchers identified several genes that are necessary for this response, including HAESA/HAESA-like 2, INFLORESCENCE DEFICIENT IN ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED. They also found that salicylic acid, a hormone involved in plant defense, plays a crucial role in triggering leaf abscission. In fact, plants with low levels of salicylic acid or mutations in genes involved in bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling fail to shed their cauline leaves normally. The researchers propose a threshold model, where minor infections are handled by limiting bacterial growth, but when an infection is deemed out of control, the plant sheds its cauline leaves. This study provides new insights into how plants defend themselves against bacterial infection and sheds light on the connection between defense and abscission pathways.
Scientists have long known that starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina play a crucial role in detecting image motion direction. To understand how SACs compute direction selectivity, researchers studied the electrical responses of SACs to moving visual stimuli. They found that SACs generate larger electrical signals when motion is towards their dendritic tips than when motion is away from them. This direction selectivity persists even when inhibitory signals from other cells are blocked, suggesting that SACs can compute direction selectivity on their own.

The researchers used a technique called Fourier analysis to break down the electrical signals into their fundamental and harmonic components. They found that the harmonic components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating that the SACs' responses are nonlinear. This nonlinearity is likely due to the activation of voltage-gated channels, which are channels that open and close in response to changes in the cell's electrical potential.

The researchers also used two-photon microscopy to study the calcium signals in SAC dendrites. They found that the distal (farthest from the cell body) parts of the dendrites are tonically depolarized, meaning they are always slightly activated, due to resting currents from tonic glutamatergic synaptic input. They also found that high-voltage-activated calcium channels are active at rest, which helps to create a spatial asymmetry in the dendrite that is necessary for direction discrimination.

Using compartmental modeling, the researchers concluded that dendritic direction selectivity in SACs can be computed by the dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient. This means that SACs can detect the direction of motion without relying on signals from other cells.
Researchers studied the mechanisms of infection and virulence in 43 different human parasites, including bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses. They found that the number of pathogens required to infect a host, known as the infective dose, varies greatly depending on the type of pathogen. Specifically, pathogens that use locally acting molecules to infect the host require a lower infective dose than those that use distantly acting molecules. However, contrary to previous predictions, the study found that pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators are not more virulent than those with locally acting molecules. Instead, the study found a negative correlation between infective dose and virulence, meaning that pathogens with lower infective doses tend to be more virulent. The study also found that pathogens that infect the host through wounded skin are more virulent than those that are ingested or inhaled. The researchers used a broad-scale comparative analysis to explain the variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence, highlighting the importance of understanding the mechanisms of infection.
Researchers have identified two microRNAs, sma-miR-277 and sma-miR-4989, that play a crucial role in the development of the parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni. This parasite causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The study used a novel bioinformatics tool to analyze the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of transcripts that are differentially expressed between the juvenile and adult stages of the parasite. The results showed that the miR-277/4989 family target sequence is significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms.

The researchers found that sma-miR-277 and sma-miR-4989 are up-regulated in adult worms, while their predicted targets are down-regulated in paired adult worms but remain unchanged in immature females. The study also identified a novel miRNA, sma-miR-4989, which is part of a miRNA cluster with sma-miR-277. The researchers propose hairpin folds for both miRNAs that are compatible with the miRNA pathway.

The study suggests that sma-miR-277 and sma-miR-4989 may play a dominant role in post-transcriptional regulation during the development of juvenile worms and are involved in the sexual development of female schistosomes. The results provide evidence for the role of microRNAs in the intra-mammalian development of this parasite and highlight the importance of miR-277 and miR-4989 in regulating gene expression changes underlying the development of juveniles and sexual maturation.
Researchers conducted a 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV) in a cave in Yunnan Province, China, inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats. They discovered 11 new SARSr-CoV strains, in addition to four previously found strains, and analyzed their full-length genomes. The study found that the SARSr-CoVs in this cave are highly diverse in the S gene, ORF3, and ORF8 regions. Importantly, strains with high genetic similarity to SARS-CoV in the hypervariable N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S1 gene, the ORF3 and ORF8 region, respectively, were discovered in this cave. The researchers also found that SARSr-CoV strains from this cave were more closely related to SARS-CoV in the non-structural protein genes ORF1a and 1b compared to those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis showed evidence of frequent recombination events within the S gene and around the ORF8 between these SARSr-CoVs. The study suggests that the direct progenitor of SARS-CoV may have originated after sequential recombination events between the precursors of these SARSr-CoVs. Cell entry studies demonstrated that three newly identified SARSr-CoVs with different S protein sequences are all able to use human ACE2 as the receptor, further exhibiting the close relationship between strains in this cave and SARS-CoV. This work provides new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS-CoV and highlights the necessity of preparedness for future emergence of SARS-like diseases.
Current methods for controlling human soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections involve mass treatment with benzimidazole and imidothiazole drugs. However, resistance to these drugs has developed in livestock roundworms, highlighting the need to monitor drug efficacy in human STHs. The faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) is being considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a means of detecting resistance. This test measures faecal egg output before and after drug treatment to estimate drug efficacy. Researchers have investigated the potential impact of density-dependent fecundity on FECRT data. Density-dependent fecundity refers to the phenomenon where female worms increase their egg production in response to a decrease in worm density. This can lead to an underestimation of drug efficacy in the FECRT, as surviving worms may increase their egg output significantly after treatment. The degree of underestimation depends on the extent to which egg output is constrained prior to treatment and the ability of worms to increase their output. This can result in varying effects on drug efficacy measurements within a group of individuals. To improve the measurement of relative drug efficacy, researchers suggest omitting cases with the heaviest infections from the FECRT, as these cases may have the greatest potential to increase their egg output. The study highlights the need for new drug resistance monitoring methods that examine direct drug effects on isolated worms or changes in worm genotypes.
Researchers have discovered that a molecule called heparan sulfate plays a crucial role in the development of the lung's tree-like structure. Heparan sulfate is a type of sugar molecule found on the surface of cells and in the extracellular matrix, a network of proteins and carbohydrates that surrounds cells. In a study, scientists deleted the gene that produces heparan sulfate in the epithelial cells of the lung and observed significant changes in lung development. The lungs of the mutant mice had expanded branching tips and reduced branching number, indicating that heparan sulfate is essential for proper lung development.

Further investigation revealed that the deletion of heparan sulfate led to reduced signaling activity of the Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein, which is responsible for suppressing the expression of the Fgf10 gene. Fgf10 is a protein that promotes cell growth and division, and its overexpression is thought to contribute to the dilated branching tips observed in the mutant lungs. The researchers also found that the biologically active form of SHH protein was reduced in both the epithelial cells and the surrounding mesenchymal cells, suggesting that heparan sulfate is necessary for maintaining SHH signaling activity.

The study highlights the importance of heparan sulfate in regulating SHH signaling, which is critical for lung morphogenesis. The findings suggest that heparan sulfate plays a key role in dictating the SHH-FGF10 signaling cascade, which is essential for the proper development of the lung's tree-like structure. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between cells and the extracellular matrix during lung development.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect genome rearrangements in cancer cells using paired-end sequencing. This technique is useful for identifying copy-neutral rearrangements, such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and can create new fusion genes. To determine how much sequencing is needed to detect these rearrangements, the researchers created a formula that calculates the probability of a fusion gene existing in a cancer genome given a set of paired-end sequences. They applied this formula to several breast cancer samples and found that they could accurately predict fusion genes with a relatively small number of large fragments. The study also showed that the ability to detect fusion genes depends on the distribution of gene lengths and that different parameters of a sequencing strategy impact the detection of rearrangement breakpoints, localization, and fusion genes, even in the presence of errors that suggest false rearrangements. The results of this study will be useful in calibrating future cancer sequencing efforts, particularly large-scale studies of many cancer genomes enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies. Paired-end sequencing of cancer genomes will provide highly reliable and precise detection of fusion genes, allowing for the systematic analysis of all classes of genomic events that lead to cancer and shedding new light on the genetic and genomic basis of cancer. The study highlights the importance of maximizing the probability of detecting fusion genes with the least amount of sequencing, taking into account factors such as the number and length of end-sequenced clones, the length of fused genes, and possible errors in breakpoint localization.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model that recreates the behaviors of chemotactic cells, which can sense the direction of chemical gradients and respond by polarizing and migrating towards attractants. The model consists of three main modules: motility, directional sensing, and polarity. The motility module allows cells to move randomly, while the directional sensing module enables cells to respond to uniform stimuli and gradients. The polarity module, linked to the motility module through the cytoskeleton, allows cells to move persistently and acquire distinct sensitivity between the front and back of the cell.

The model uses reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell cortex implemented in the level set framework to simulate cell migration and changes in cellular morphology. Simulations show that the model can recreate most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells, including the ability to move towards attractants and respond to gradients. The model also demonstrates that adaptation is not absolutely required for chemotaxis, as cells without an adaptation mechanism can still perform efficient chemotaxis.

The researchers used a previously described local excitation, global inhibition biased excitable network (LEGI-BEN) and added two new modules to the model. They used level set methods and a viscoelastic mechanical model to simulate cytoskeleton-mediated cellular deformations and movements. The model can simulate cell movement under various scenarios, including the coexistence of polarized and unpolarized cells, and the acquisition of increased polarity during directed migration.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called TDRD6 in the development of sperm cells. TDRD6 is essential for the proper formation of a structure called the chromatoid body, which is crucial for sperm development and fertility. The study found that TDRD6 interacts with a protein called PRMT5, which helps with a process called splicing, where genetic material is rearranged to create a mature messenger RNA molecule. TDRD6 also associates with another protein called SmB, which is a key component of the spliceosome, a complex machine that carries out splicing.

In the absence of TDRD6, the assembly of the spliceosome is impaired, leading to increased levels of incomplete spliceosomes. This results in defects in mRNA splicing, including the incorrect use of introns and exons, and aberrant representation of splice junctions. The study also found that TDRD6-deficient sperm cells have reduced numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies, which are involved in the maturation of snRNPs (small nuclear ribonucleoproteins).

The researchers analyzed the transcriptome of TDRD6-deficient sperm cells and found a high number of splicing defects. This suggests that TDRD6 plays a crucial role in the maturation of the spliceosome and mRNA splicing during the early stages of sperm development. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of spermatogenesis and highlights the importance of TDRD6 in ensuring proper sperm development and fertility.
Researchers have developed a new statistical model to study how bacteria colonize a host and are cleared from the body. This model, called a Bayesian model, provides a more accurate way to determine whether bacteria from different time points are from the same or different colonization events. Previous methods relied on a fixed genetic distance threshold to make this determination, but this approach was often inadequate to account for the diversity of the underlying bacterial population and the uncertainty in the estimated rates of acquisition and clearance.

The new model uses a combination of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to provide probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same. This allows researchers to determine bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. The model also accounts for within-host variation and the time intervals between consecutive measurements.

The researchers validated the model using simulations and applied it to a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a longitudinal clinical study. The model provides a more accurate and robust way to study colonization dynamics, which is critical for understanding the transmission of bacteria between hosts and the emergence of invasive strains. The model's R-code implementation is freely available for use by other researchers. This new approach has the potential to improve our understanding of bacterial colonization and the development of effective interventions to prevent the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Scientists have long known that the plant hormone auxin plays a crucial role in the development of new organs in plants, such as leaves and flowers. The shoot apical meristem, a group of stem cells at the top of a plant, is responsible for initiating these new organs in a highly organized and patterned way. Researchers have proposed several theories to explain how auxin transporters, called PIN proteins, create local maxima of auxin that lead to organ initiation. One theory, called canalization, suggests that PIN proteins amplify and stabilize existing auxin fluxes, while another theory proposes that PIN proteins transport auxin towards areas with the highest concentrations. However, these two theories seem to contradict each other, making it difficult to understand how auxin transport works in the shoot apical meristem. Using computer simulations, researchers have now shown that a third theory, called flux-based polarization, can explain auxin transport in the shoot apical meristem, providing a unifying concept for the control of auxin distribution in plants. This theory suggests that PIN proteins sense and respond to auxin fluxes, rather than just local concentrations. Further experiments are needed to confirm this theory and distinguish it from other hypotheses.
Researchers have developed a more efficient approach to finding diagnostic biomarkers for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. They combined wet lab experiments with in silico searches to identify specific peptides that can be used in rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). The team used high-quality genome sequences and bioinformatic tools to narrow down the search for potential biomarkers. They focused on IgG1, an antibody that has been shown to be a potential indicator of post-chemotherapeutic relapse in VL.

The researchers used immunoblots to identify L. donovani protein bands detected by IgG1 from VL patients. They then used mass spectrometry to confidently identify these antigens and searched for evidence of constitutive protein expression and presence of antigenic domains or high accessibility to B-cells. In silico algorithms were used to map the linear epitopes of the shortlisted proteins. The team then screened predicted epitope peptides from the shortlisted proteins using peptide arrays and identified the most reactive one.

The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes using VL and non-endemic healthy control patient sera. The results showed that over 90% of the proteins identified from the immunoblots did not satisfy the selection criteria and were excluded from the downstream epitope mapping. However, the most reactive peptide had a sensitivity of 84% (95% CI 60-97%) for IgG1 with Sudanese VL sera on RDT prototypes, and none of the sera from non-endemic healthy controls were positive. This proof-of-concept strategy can be applied to the development of more robust IgG1 RDTs for monitoring clinical status in VL.
Researchers studied 317 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries, including Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran. They found that 61.5% of the cases had granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in response to an infection. Of these, 25.2% were caseating granulomas, a type of granuloma typically associated with tuberculosis (TB). The researchers found that caseating granulomas were more common in patients from Saudi Arabia and had a different microscopic appearance compared to other types of granulomas. They also found that patients with caseating granulomas took longer to heal compared to those with other types of granulomas. The study suggests that CL should be considered in the differential diagnosis for cases with caseating granulomas in endemic regions, where both CL and TB are common. This is because 18.2% of the CL cases in the study had caseating granulomas. The researchers also found that the type of leishmania parasite was not associated with the type of granuloma. The study's findings highlight the importance of considering CL as a possible cause of caseating granulomas in patients from endemic regions.
Researchers have identified a gene called Zfp69 as a potential contributor to the development of type 2 diabetes in mice. This gene, which codes for a zinc finger domain transcription factor, is located on chromosome 4 and is associated with a region known as Nidd/SJL. The Nidd/SJL region is linked to an increased risk of diabetes in mice, particularly in those that are obese. By studying the genetic makeup of mice with and without the Nidd/SJL region, scientists were able to pinpoint Zfp69 as the most likely candidate gene responsible for the increased risk of diabetes.

The researchers found that mice with the Nidd/SJL region had a different version of the Zfp69 gene compared to mice without it. Specifically, the Nidd/SJL mice had a "normal" version of the gene, while mice without the region had a truncated version that was unable to function properly. When scientists introduced the Nidd/SJL version of Zfp69 into mice that were prone to obesity, the mice developed diabetes. This suggests that the Zfp69 gene plays a role in the development of diabetes, particularly in the context of obesity.

Interestingly, the researchers also found that the human version of the Zfp69 gene, known as ZNF642, was overexpressed in the fat tissue of people with type 2 diabetes. This suggests that the Zfp69 gene may also play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes in humans. Overall, the discovery of Zfp69 as a potential contributor to diabetes provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying this complex disease.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signaling pathways that control the differentiation of T helper (Th) cells. Th cells are a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in the body's response to infection and disease. The model predicts that Th cells can differentiate into various subtypes, including Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T (Treg) cells, as well as hybrid cell types that co-express markers from multiple subtypes.

The model uses a logical formalism to analyze the interactions between signaling pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks that control Th cell differentiation. This approach allows researchers to simulate the effects of different environments on Th cell differentiation and identify stable states that correspond to specific cell subtypes.

The model reveals that Th cells can co-express markers from multiple subtypes in an environment-dependent manner, suggesting that cell plasticity is a key feature of Th cell differentiation. This is in contrast to previous models that assumed cross-inhibiting master transcription factors to generate canonical Th subtypes, thereby precluding cell plasticity.

The researchers used an original model reduction approach to cope with the size and complexity of the resulting network. They also used a stable state identification algorithm to identify the stable states corresponding to different Th cell subtypes. The model can be used to explore novel differentiation pathways in silico and has implications for our understanding of the immune system and the development of new treatments for immune-related diseases.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict where and how transcription factors bind to the genome during early Drosophila development. Transcription factors are proteins that control gene expression by binding to specific DNA sequences. The model takes into account the DNA sequence, the affinity of the transcription factor for the DNA, and the accessibility of the chromatin, which is the complex of DNA, proteins, and other molecules that make up chromosomes.

The model was tested on five transcription factors that play a crucial role in anterior-posterior patterning in Drosophila embryos. The researchers found that the model could accurately predict the binding of these factors to specific regions of the genome, with a correlation of 0.6-0.9 with experimental measurements. However, the model struggled to predict binding events that did not occur in vivo, which was attributed to reduced chromatin accessibility.

To improve the model's accuracy, the researchers incorporated experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility into the model. This allowed the model to restrict predicted binding to regions of open chromatin, which significantly improved the predictions. The results showed that in regions of open chromatin, binding can be predicted almost exclusively by the sequence specificity of individual factors, with a minimal role for protein interactions.

The study suggests that a combination of experimentally determined chromatin accessibility data and simple computational models of transcription factor binding can be used to predict the binding landscape of any animal transcription factor with significant precision. The researchers applied the model to predict the genome-wide binding of transcription factors across 4,251 genes and found a strong relation between the model's ability to accurately predict binding and gene expression levels.
Biologists have long sought to understand the mechanisms that control organ growth and development. This knowledge is crucial for understanding both normal development and disease, such as cancer. A key group of proteins, called basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factors, play a significant role in regulating cell proliferation. These proteins, including the E protein family and their inhibitors, the Id proteins, are often deregulated in cancerous cells. In fruit flies (Drosophila), the E protein orthologue Daughterless (Da) and the Id orthologue Extramacrochaetae (Emc) are the only members of these classes of bHLH proteins.

Research has shown that Da and Emc control cell proliferation in Drosophila imaginal discs, which are groups of cells that give rise to adult organs. The study found that Emc regulates the G2/M transition, which is a critical step in cell division, by controlling the activity of Da. Da, in turn, acts as a transcriptional repressor of the Cdc25 phosphatase, string, which is a key activator of the G2/M transition. When Emc levels are reduced or Da levels are high, cell proliferation is impaired. However, the ectopic expression of string in these cells can rescue the proliferative defects. This suggests that Emc controls cell proliferation by regulating Da, which in turn represses string. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of cell cycle regulation and highlights the importance of Emc and Da in controlling cell proliferation in Drosophila imaginal discs.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive pipeline to analyze phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments, which can help identify key proteins and signaling networks involved in cell growth and development. Phosphoproteomics is a technique that measures the relative levels of protein phosphorylation, a crucial mechanism of signal transduction. However, phosphoproteomics has limitations due to the limited number of detectable phosphorylation sites per protein. To address this, the researchers created a customized pipeline that combines phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation network analysis, and causal relationship discovery to identify proteins involved in specific pathways. They applied this pipeline to yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) data generated using the SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino acids in Cell culture) technique with kinase-dead mutations. The analysis identified 5 high-confidence proteins and 19 hub proteins involved in stress responses, including 9 proteins with direct or indirect evidence of involvement in filamentous growth. Four of these predicted proteins were validated through interventional phenotypic experiments, showing differential invasive growth. This pipeline provides a systematic approach for discovering signaling networks using interventional phosphoproteome data and can suggest candidate proteins for further investigation. The researchers anticipate that this methodology can be applied to other interventional studies using different experimental platforms. The study demonstrates the potential of interventional phosphoproteome studies to provide new insights into signaling pathways involved in biological processes, such as yeast filamentous growth.
Researchers studied how the X chromosome is regulated in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly. They found that the X chromosome does not undergo dosage compensation, a process that equalizes gene expression between males and females, in most of the male germline. This means that genes on the X chromosome are not expressed at the same level as genes on other chromosomes in male Drosophila.

The researchers also looked for evidence of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), a process that silences the X chromosome during meiosis in males. However, they found no evidence of MSCI in the Drosophila male germline. Instead, they discovered that the expression of genes on the X chromosome is reduced compared to genes on other chromosomes, even in premeiotic cells. This reduction in expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage compensation, suggesting that a previously unknown mechanism limits X chromosome expression during spermatogenesis in Drosophila.

These findings resolve previous conflicting reports and have implications for our understanding of genome evolution and speciation in Drosophila. The study suggests that the regulation of the X chromosome in the male germline is more complex than previously thought, and that additional mechanisms may be involved in limiting X chromosome expression during spermatogenesis.
Researchers studied the early stages of Citrobacter rodentium infection in mice, a model for human diarrheal infections caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). They found that the formation of "attachment/effacement" (A/E) lesions, a hallmark of these infections, is restricted to a short window of opportunity within the first 18 hours of infection. These lesions are formed by clonal bacterial populations that depend on local growth to persist, rather than continuous re-infection from the luminal compartment.

The researchers discovered that the early events of C. rodentium infection shape the ongoing intestinal geography and severity of infection, despite the presence of phenotypically virulent luminal bacteria. They also found that the host's innate immune response, mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling, plays a crucial role in preventing the formation of new A/E lesions. This response is induced specifically by virulent C. rodentium in a virulence gene-dependent manner.

The study suggests that the establishment phase of C. rodentium pathogenesis is limited to a very short window of opportunity, determining both disease geography and severity. The findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of EPEC and EHEC infections in humans, which share similar mechanisms with C. rodentium. The study highlights the importance of early host-bacteria interactions in determining the outcome of these infections.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, such as species or gene variants, when only a fraction of each population is sampled. This is a common problem in fields like ecology and genomic epidemiology, where complete sampling is often not possible. The new method, based on Bayesian inference, takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and optimal estimates of overlap. It also provides a way to quantify the uncertainty of these estimates.

The method is particularly useful for estimating the overlap between two populations when the total number of objects in each population is known. This is the case in the study of Plasmodium falciparum parasites, where the goal is to estimate the overlap between two parasites' repertoires of var types. The method can also be used prospectively in study planning to determine the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.

Unlike existing methods, this new approach does not assume that species counts are complete, which can lead to bias. It can also incorporate additional information, such as whole-genome datasets, to improve estimates. The method has the potential to be applied to other areas, such as the study of multigene antigen families in Plasmodium spp. or general studies of β-diversity in multigene families.
Eukaryotic protein kinases play a crucial role in regulating various cellular functions by phosphorylating specific protein substrates. These enzymes have a highly conserved catalytic core that oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations in the active state. However, the intramolecular interactions that regulate this active state mechanics were not well understood. Researchers used biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to study cAMP-dependent protein kinase, a representative model of eukaryotic protein kinases. They identified a set of highly conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that work together to regulate the active state mechanics. These interactions include a salt bridge between a lysine from the β3-strand and a glutamate from the αC-helix, as well as an electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and the αC-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory spine and Shell. Contrary to previous assumptions, the researchers found that the highly conserved lysine residue in the β3-strand is not essential for phosphoryl transfer, but rather plays a crucial role in facilitating the active state mechanics by coordinating the transition of the β-sheet region of the N-lobe and linking it with the αC-helix. This study provides new insights into the regulation of eukaryotic protein kinases and highlights the importance of the lysine residue in the β3-strand for the active state mechanics.
American Samoa conducted mass drug administration (MDA) to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) from 2000 to 2006. After MDA, the World Health Organization recommends systematic post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) to assess recent LF transmission. This study compared the effectiveness of two TAS designs: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 years and a community-based survey targeting people aged 8 years and older. In 2016, a systematic school-based TAS was conducted in 29 elementary schools, and a cluster survey was conducted in 28 villages on the two main islands of American Samoa. The results showed that the school-based TAS identified nine antigen-positive children, with an overall adjusted circulating filarial antigen (CFA) prevalence of 0.7%. In contrast, the community-based survey identified 102 antigen-positive people, with an overall adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2%. The study found that CFA prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school-based TAS had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive predictive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community-based survey, although more operationally challenging, identified antigen-positive individuals of all ages and foci of high antigen prevalence. The study confirmed recrudescence of LF transmission in American Samoa 10 years after the last round of MDA.
Researchers studied how zebrafish determine their sex and found that oocytes, or egg cells, play a crucial role in maintaining the female sex phenotype in adult zebrafish. In zebrafish, sex determination is a complex process influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. The study focused on two oocyte-produced signaling molecules, Bmp15 and Gdf9, and their potential role in female sex determination and maintenance.

The researchers generated targeted mutations in the genes for Bmp15 and Gdf9 and found that females deficient in Bmp15 began developing normally but switched sex during the mid-to-late juvenile stage and became fertile males. This suggests that Bmp15 is essential for maintaining the female sex phenotype in adult zebrafish. The study also found that estrogen production is necessary for female development and that Bmp15 likely regulates estrogen biosynthesis by promoting the development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle.

The researchers propose a model in which the oocyte-somatic gonad interaction stabilizes the expression of the cyp19a1a gene, which is responsible for estrogen production. They found that the somatic gonad expresses probable receptors for Bmp15, supporting this model. The study provides the first mechanistic insights into how oocytes regulate the maintenance of sex in zebrafish and identifies a genetic pathway required for female sexual development and maintenance in zebrafish that is likely conserved in other fish species.
Scientists have long known that Hox proteins play a crucial role in shaping the body plan of animals by controlling the expression of specific genes in different parts of the body. To understand how Hox proteins achieve such precise control, researchers studied the regulation of a gene called reaper, which is involved in cell death, in the fruit fly Drosophila. They found that the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) works with at least eight other transcription factors to activate reaper expression in a specific subset of cells in the maxillary segment. This suggests that Hox proteins do not act alone in regulating their target genes, but instead form complex interactions with other transcription factors to achieve the right level and location of gene expression. The researchers also found that these interactions occur on small, modular regions of DNA called Hox response elements (HREs), which contain multiple binding sites for different transcription factors. This complex interplay between Hox proteins and other transcription factors is thought to be responsible for the proper spatio-temporal expression of Hox target genes. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how Hox proteins shape the body plan of animals, and suggest that a large number of transcription factors are involved in Hox target gene regulation.
Researchers studied a plant protein called ADR1-L2, which plays a role in the plant's defense against pathogens. ADR1-L2 is part of a family of proteins called NB-LRRs, which help plants recognize and respond to pathogen-specific molecules. The researchers created an autoactive version of ADR1-L2, called ADR1-L2D484V, which causes the plant to produce high levels of a chemical called salicylic acid (SA) and exhibit increased disease resistance. They found that this autoactive version of ADR1-L2 requires an intact P-loop, a specific structure within the protein, to function. The researchers used ADR1-L2D484V to study the genetic requirements for signaling from this protein and found that it does not require an enzyme called NADPH oxidase, but is negatively regulated by two other proteins, EDS1 and AtMC1. They also found that the activity of ADR1-L2D484V is correlated with its phenotypic outputs, which are both SA-dependent and SA-independent. The researchers propose a genetic model that explains how ADR1-L2 is involved in a feedback regulation loop that includes SA and EDS1. This model suggests that ADR1-L2 plays a role in amplifying defense and cell death signaling in response to pathogen attack. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of plant defense and the role of ADR1-L2 in this process.
Researchers have been studying the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis, a type of plant, to understand how it contributes to gene silencing. The RdDM pathway involves several components, including SUVH9 and IDN2, which work together to silence genes by adding methyl groups to DNA. A protein called MORC6 has also been shown to play a role in gene silencing, but how it interacts with other components of the RdDM pathway was unclear. In this study, scientists found that MORC6 interacts with SUVH9 and IDN2, and that these interactions are necessary for gene silencing. They also discovered that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, which helps to compact DNA, interacts with MORC6 and is involved in gene silencing. The study suggests that the RdDM components are not only involved in DNA methylation, but also in MORC6-mediated heterochromatin condensation, which is the process of compacting DNA. This process enhances gene silencing at methylated genomic regions. The researchers found that MORC6 targets specific genes for silencing, and that the RdDM components are necessary for this process. They also found that the loss of MORC6 does not lead to a loss of DNA methylation, suggesting that MORC6 plays a distinct role in gene silencing. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms of gene silencing in Arabidopsis and highlights the importance of the RdDM pathway in regulating gene expression.
Researchers studied the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) in vertebrate development using zebrafish as a model. Hsp90 is a molecular chaperone that helps proteins fold correctly and respond to stress. The study found that compromising Hsp90 function in zebrafish revealed previously unknown developmental anomalies, such as severe eye malformations. This suggests that Hsp90 plays a crucial role in buffering genetic variation and maintaining developmental stability. The study also found that mild perturbation of Hsp90 function at critical developmental stages can lead to variable penetrance and expressivity of developmental anomalies. In other words, small changes in Hsp90 function can result in a range of outcomes, from no effect to severe malformations. This is in contrast to Drosophila, where Hsp90 inhibition does not affect developmental stability. The study also found that Hsp90 inhibition can decrease developmental stability in zebrafish, leading to increased asymmetry in eye malformations. Analysis of a specific mutation in the pax6b gene suggests a molecular mechanism for the buffering of mutations by Hsp90. The study implies that the interaction between genotype and environment plays a major role in the variable penetrance and expressivity of many developmental anomalies. The findings have important implications for understanding the molecular events that can alter the balance between cryptic and overt phenotypes.
Researchers have identified and characterized N-terminally acetylated proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, a common modification found throughout the tree of life. They analyzed amino-terminal peptides from proteins extracted from Drosophila Kc167 cells and detected over 1,200 mature protein N-termini. The study found that N-terminal acetylation occurs in insects with a similar frequency as in humans. A rule, referred to as the (X)PX rule, was identified as the sole determinant for N-terminal acetylation, indicating that certain amino acid sequences prevent acetylation. This rule can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of N-terminal acetylation. By expressing mutated proteins in cell lines and flies, the researchers developed a generic assay to probe the functional importance of N-terminal acetylation. The (X)PX rule is proposed to be of general validity in lower and higher eukaryotes, making it a useful tool for studying N-terminal acetylation in various species. The study provides a straightforward strategy for systematically studying the functional relevance of N-terminal acetylations in cells and whole organisms. The findings suggest that N-terminal acetylation promotes various biological functions that cannot be predicted from the primary amino acid sequence, highlighting the need for a method to generate and express proteins that differ in N-terminal acetylation.
Scientists have long known that RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) plays a crucial role in producing transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which are essential for protein synthesis. However, understanding how RNAP III terminates transcription, or stops producing RNA, has been incomplete. Researchers used a genetic approach to identify mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces pombe that affect RNAP III's ability to terminate transcription. They found 122 point mutations that cluster in specific regions of the enzyme, including the active center, pore, and funnel. These mutations led to increased elongation rates, suggesting that RNAP III's ability to terminate transcription is linked to its elongation rate. The researchers also found that mutants with increased elongation rates produced more RNA than wild-type cells, even when accounting for differences in RNA decay rates. This suggests that RNAP III's termination efficiency is inversely related to its elongation rate, a phenomenon known as kinetic coupling. The study also found that mutations in the C11 subunit of RNAP III, which is involved in RNA cleavage, are key determinants of termination and can activate RNAP III for overall transcription. These findings have implications for understanding how RNAP III is regulated in cells and how its dysregulation may contribute to diseases such as cancer.
Researchers have developed a new method to predict which proteins interact with SH2 domains, a type of protein that plays a crucial role in cell signaling. SH2 domains recognize and bind to specific phosphopeptides, but current experiments can only cover a small fraction of all possible interactions. The new method uses the structure of SH2-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm to predict these interactions. The researchers tested their approach and found that it performs similarly to experimentally derived consensus sequences and substitution matrices in predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH2 domains. They used their method to provide a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure, filtered on secondary structure and phosphorylation state. The predictions were validated using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic score obtained from a naive Bayes integration of information on coexpression, conservation of the interaction in other species, shared interaction partners, and functions. The predictions led to a new hypothesis for the role of SH2 domains in signaling. The researchers also showed that the FoldX algorithm can predict the in vitro binding thermodynamics of protein-phosphopeptide complexes, including nine different SH2 domains, making it a useful tool for genome-wide predictions.
Researchers have identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (CyP40) that can dissolve toxic protein clumps called amyloids in the brain. These amyloids are a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The study found that CyP40 can break down amyloids made from a protein called tau, which is a major contributor to Alzheimer's disease. The researchers discovered that CyP40 works by interacting with specific parts of the tau protein that are rich in proline residues. This interaction allows CyP40 to twist and unwind the tau protein, preventing it from forming toxic clumps.

In experiments, the researchers showed that introducing CyP40 into a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease reduced the amount of toxic tau clumps in the brain and improved cognitive function. They also found that CyP40 can dissolve amyloids made from other proteins that contain proline residues. The study suggests that CyP40 may be a potential therapeutic target for treating Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. The researchers propose that delivering CyP40 to the brain could help to halt or even reverse cognitive decline associated with these diseases. They also identified a unique property of CyP40 that allows it to break down amyloids without using energy, which may be a key factor in its ability to dissolve toxic protein clumps.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the formation of heterocyst patterns in cyanobacteria filaments. Heterocysts are specialized cells that form in response to nitrogen deprivation, allowing the filament to survive. The model combines the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacterium with the diffusion of nitrogen along the filament. By simulating the behavior of individual cells under different conditions, the researchers were able to reproduce the main features of heterocyst pattern formation observed in experiments. The model shows that noise, or random fluctuations, plays a crucial role in the development of heterocyst patterns. This suggests that cyanobacteria filaments have evolved to respond efficiently to the noisy conditions found in their natural environment. The model consists of a set of differential equations that describe the time evolution of the concentrations of relevant molecular products. By coupling the genetic circuits of individual cells via molecular diffusion, the researchers were able to simulate the dynamics of cyanobacteria filaments and understand the principles behind heterocyst pattern formation. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of cell differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms.
A study conducted in Cameroon aimed to investigate the relationship between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin (CDTI) program, their beliefs about onchocerciasis, and their adherence to ivermectin treatment in three regions with high onchocerciasis prevalence. The study found that people's perceptions of the CDTI program were more strongly associated with adherence to ivermectin than their beliefs about onchocerciasis. Specifically, individuals who had a positive opinion of the ivermectin distribution campaigns and believed in the commitment of community drug distributors were more likely to adhere to the treatment. In contrast, those who held misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission, such as believing that it is caused by poor hygiene or high sugar intake, were less likely to adhere to the treatment. The study also found that there are still frequent misconceptions about onchocerciasis transmission in Cameroon, including the belief that onchocerciasis is caused by high sugar intake. The study suggests that in addition to education and sensitization on onchocerciasis and ivermectin use, local health authorities should also emphasize the implementation of the CDTI program in the communities, with a focus on community ownership and ensuring good work by community drug distributors. This approach may help improve adherence to ivermectin treatment and ultimately contribute to the elimination of onchocerciasis in Cameroon.
Researchers investigated the relationship between DNA methylation, genetic variants, and protein biomarkers for diseases such as cancer, inflammation, and cardiovascular disease. They analyzed data from over 10 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions in relation to 121 protein biomarkers. The study aimed to determine the relative contribution of genetic and epigenetic variation to biomarker levels.

The researchers performed epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify associations between DNA methylation, SNPs, and protein biomarkers. They found 124 and 45 loci with significant associations between DNA methylation and protein biomarkers, and between SNPs and protein biomarkers, respectively. Most of the GWAS loci were cis-regulatory, meaning they were located near the genes they affected, while most of the EWAS loci were trans-regulatory, meaning they were located far from the genes they affected.

The study found that all EWAS signals that overlapped with a GWAS locus were driven by underlying genetic variants, and three EWAS signals were confounded by smoking. The researchers also found that cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers appeared to have an effect on DNA methylation levels, but not the other way around. The study suggests that DNA methylation has a limited direct effect on biomarkers of complex diseases, and instead reflects the underlying pattern of genetic variants, specific environmental exposures, or secondary effects of disease pathogenesis.
Researchers have discovered that the varicella zoster virus (VZV) can directly impair the function of natural killer (NK) cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off viral infections. In laboratory experiments, VZV was found to potently inhibit the ability of NK cells to respond to target cells, leading to a loss of both cytotoxic and cytokine responses. This impairment was observed not only in NK cells that were infected with VZV, but also in uninfected NK cells that were exposed to VZV in culture. The researchers found that direct contact between NK cells and VZV-infected cells was necessary for the impairment of NK cell function. Analysis of the NK cell surface receptors revealed that their expression remained stable, but the cells were unable to respond to stimulation signals. The study also found that the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), a closely related virus, was able to infect NK cells and render them unresponsive to target cell stimulation, although it differentially affected cytokine production compared to VZV. The findings provide new insights into how VZV manipulates the immune response and reveal a previously unreported strategy of immune evasion employed by the virus.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanism behind apparent motion (AM), a phenomenon where two stimuli presented at different locations create the illusion of a single moving stimulus. They found that AM suppresses responses in the early visual cortex, specifically in the primary visual cortex (V1), which is responsible for processing basic visual information. This suppression is not due to increased activation of V1 neurons, as previously thought, but rather due to predictive coding models, which suggest that the brain predicts the motion of the stimulus and suppresses responses to stimuli that match this prediction.

The study used a population code model of early visual processing to simulate the effects of AM on the detection of target gratings. The results showed that AM has a distinct effect on detection performance, limiting the maximum performance at high contrast levels. The suppression of responses in V1 is strongest when the target orientation matches the orientation of the inducers, which are the stimuli used to create the illusion of motion.

The researchers found that AM masking, which is the reduced detectability of stimuli along the AM path, can be explained by predictive coding models. These models propose that higher-level predictions of motion are generated, which "explain away" lower-level responses to expected sensory input. The study suggests that the brain's ability to predict motion is a key factor in the suppression of responses in the early visual cortex during AM.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding how the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax contributes to the transformation of CD4+ T cells. Tax promotes cell proliferation and survival by permanently activating the NF-κB pathway and inducing the expression of many NF-κB target genes. To clarify the underlying molecular mechanism, scientists reconstituted Tax-stimulated IKK activation in a cell-free system. This allowed them to dissect the essential cellular components required for primary IKK activation by Tax and study the biochemical mechanism involved.

The study revealed that Tax functions as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, working together with specific E2 enzymes to catalyze the assembly of free mixed-linkage polyubiquitin chains. These polyubiquitin chains directly activate IKK by binding to its NEMO subunit. This biochemical function of Tax clarifies the confusion surrounding HTLV-1-induced IKK-NF-κB activation and identifies the essential cellular factors hijacked by HTLV-1. The findings may also shed light on the development of therapeutics for adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis/HTLV-1-associated myelopathy (TSP/HAM).

HTLV-1 Tax is the first pathogenic agent shown to activate NF-κB, and research on it has greatly advanced our understanding of NF-κB activation. However, the molecular mechanism by which Tax activates IKK-NF-κB has remained unclear until now. This study provides new insights into the biochemical function of Tax and the underlying mechanism of IKK activation, utilizing minimal cellular ubiquitination components for NF-κB activation.
Researchers conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between the number of individuals introduced to establish a new population (propagule pressure) and the success of alien species establishment. They analyzed data from a wide range of species, including invertebrates, plants, and vertebrates, and found a positive correlation between propagule pressure and establishment success. However, the effect of propagule pressure was most significant when the number of individuals introduced was between 10 and 100. The study also found that different analytical approaches used in previous studies contributed to the variation in the strength of the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success, with animal introductions showing larger effect sizes than plant introductions. On the other hand, the scale of the study (from field to global) and the methodology used (observational, experimental, or proxy) did not affect the relationship. The researchers used Bayesian meta-analytical methods to estimate the overall effect of propagule pressure on establishment success and found remarkable consistency in the form of the relationship across different species and life histories. This study provides the first quantitative systematic review of the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success, shedding light on the factors that influence the success of alien species introductions.
Interleukin 17A (IL-17) plays a significant role in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases by enhancing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Research has shown that IL-17 attenuates the degradation of mRNAs encoding these mediators by altering the cooperation between AU-binding proteins (AUBPs) and microRNA16 (miR16). AUBPs target AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs, either facilitating their decay or stabilization. In the presence of miR16, AUBPs and the target mRNA assemble in a novel ribonucleoprotein complex, leading to mRNA degradation. However, IL-17 reduces miR16 expression and promotes the binding of stabilizing AUBPs over destabilizing ones, resulting in reduced mRNA decay. This suggests that miR16 directs the competition between degrading and stabilizing AUBPs for target mRNAs independently of a seed sequence. The interactions between AUBPs, miR16, and the target mRNA depend on specific RNA sequences and structural restraints. IL-17 exerts its function by changing the contribution of miR16 and AUBPs. The study found that IL-17 attenuates the degradation of mRNAs encoding inflammatory mediators, such as IL-8, IL-6, and G-CSF, in epithelial and fibroblast cells. This results in a hyper-responsive production of these pro-inflammatory mediators. The findings indicate that modulation of AUBP-miR16 mediated regulation of gene expression by IL-17 depends on the specific mRNA target, limiting miR16 usage and differential participation of the AUBPs.
Researchers in Uganda investigated the relationship between cattle and human trypanosomiasis, a disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. The study focused on two districts, Kaberamaido and Dokolo, where the disease has been spreading rapidly. The researchers collected blood samples from cattle in villages that had reported cases of sleeping sickness and those that had not. They found that cattle in villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness were more likely to be infected with T. brucei s.l. than those in villages without reported cases. The study also showed that older cattle were more likely to be infected with T. brucei s.l. than younger cattle. Furthermore, the researchers found that villages with a higher prevalence of T. brucei s.l. in their cattle herds were more likely to have T. b. rhodesiense, the parasite that causes human trypanosomiasis. The study suggests that the presence of T. brucei s.l. in cattle can be used as an indicator of the risk of human trypanosomiasis in a village. This could help public health officials identify areas where the disease is more likely to be present and take measures to prevent its spread.
Researchers have investigated the role of the NSL complex in regulating gene expression in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. The NSL complex is a group of proteins that work together to modify histones, which are proteins that DNA wraps around. Histone modifications can affect how genes are turned on or off. The study found that the NSL complex targets a large number of genes that are always active, known as housekeeping genes. These genes are essential for basic cellular functions and are expressed in all cell types. The researchers used a technique called ChIP-seq to analyze the binding sites of the NSL complex across the Drosophila genome. They found that 85.5% of the genes bound by the NSL complex are housekeeping genes. The study also showed that these genes have specific histone modifications, such as H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me3, and H3K9ac, which are associated with active gene expression. Furthermore, the researchers found that the NSL complex is required for the efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II, an enzyme that transcribes DNA into RNA, to the promoters of these genes. The study suggests that the NSL complex plays a crucial role in regulating housekeeping genes in Drosophila by modulating the initiation of RNA polymerase II transcription. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation in Drosophila and have implications for understanding transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes.
Researchers have developed a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD), a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of the DUX4 gene. The model mimics the epigenetic and DUX4 expression patterns seen in FSHD patients and controls, including high DUX4 expression levels in the germline, incomplete epigenetic repression in somatic tissue, and variegated DUX4 expression in muscle nuclei associated with D4Z4 chromatin relaxation. The researchers generated two transgenic mouse lines: one carrying a D4Z4 genomic region from a contracted pathogenic FSHD1 allele and one carrying a normal-sized, non-pathogenic allele. The data suggest that somatic epigenetic silencing of DUX4 is an evolutionary conserved mechanism and that contracted D4Z4 repeat arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to a variegated expression pattern of DUX4 protein in skeletal muscle nuclei. The model accurately models the difference between FSHD patients and control individuals and may serve as a valuable tool for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying FSHD and testing new therapeutic intervention strategies. The researchers also found that DUX4 activates similar functional gene groups in mouse muscle cells as it does in human muscle cells, and that the detrimental effects of DUX4 expression in mouse muscle can be reversed by RNA interference.
Researchers have been working to develop a malaria vaccine using the Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) protein, but current vaccines only provide protection against closely related parasite strains. To overcome this limitation, scientists created a vaccine called AMA1 Quadvax (QV) that combines four diverse allelic proteins. This vaccine elicited polyclonal antibodies in rabbits that inhibited the invasion of four vaccine and 22 non-vaccine strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The QV vaccine induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies compared to a monovalent 3D7 AMA1 vaccine. These antibodies targeted conserved regions on the AMA1 protein, including a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough on domain-1. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against this epitope were highly potent and inhibited the binding of AMA1 to its ligand RON2. Another mAb, 1E10, which bound to domain-3, was also broadly inhibitory and blocked the proteolytic processing of AMA1. These findings suggest that vaccination with a few diverse antigenic proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes. The discovery of novel inhibition susceptible regions and epitopes can be used to improve the antigenic breadth and inhibitory response of AMA1 vaccines.
Researchers have discovered a previously unknown mechanism that regulates the timing of mitotic spindle displacement in cells. The mitotic spindle is a crucial component of cell division, responsible for separating chromosomes into two daughter cells. In many cells, the spindle is displaced to one side of the cell, allowing for unequal cell division. However, the precise timing of this displacement was not well understood. The study used the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote as a model system to investigate the timing of spindle displacement. The researchers found that the anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and its activator Cdc20/Fizzy play a key role in regulating the timing of spindle displacement. They discovered that reducing the function of the proteasome, the APC, or Cdc20/Fizzy delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) in prometaphase caused the spindle to displace early. This suggests that the APC-dependent negative regulation of CDK serves as a timer for spindle displacement. The study also found that the delay in spindle displacement allows for the completion of spindle assembly before the spindle is pulled away from the center of the cell. The researchers conclude that the timing of spindle displacement is precisely regulated in the C. elegans zygote, and that this mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved in other systems.
Researchers studied the genetic adaptations of two high-altitude populations, the Tibetans and the Andeans, to understand how they cope with low oxygen levels. These populations have lived at high altitudes for thousands of years and have developed unique physiological responses to the low oxygen levels. However, the genetic basis of these adaptations was not well understood. The researchers performed a genome scan to identify genes that show evidence of adaptation to high altitude. They looked at each chromosome to find regions with previously unknown functions related to altitude phenotypes. They also examined groups of genes involved in oxygen metabolism and sensing to test the hypothesis that specific pathways have been involved in genetic adaptation to altitude. The researchers used four population genetic statistics to detect signatures of natural selection and identified selection-nominated candidate genes and gene regions in the two populations separately. The results showed that the Tibetan and Andean patterns of genetic adaptation are distinct from each other, with both populations showing evidence of positive natural selection in different genes or gene regions. One gene, EGLN1, which is important in cellular oxygen sensing, shows evidence of positive selection in both Tibetans and Andeans, but with different patterns of variation. The study suggests that several key genes are responsible for adaptation to high altitude in both populations and provides a basis for future studies to confirm the role of these genes in adaptation to altitude.
Double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are hazardous events that can occur due to environmental factors or DNA replication errors. Efficient and precise repair of DSBs is crucial for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to genetic instability. Inverted DNA repeats (IRs) near a DSB can alter the repair pathway from an accurate gene conversion to a break-induced replication (BIR) pathway, resulting in genetic instability. IRs form unusual DNA structures when present in single-strand DNA, which is formed by DSB resection. The type of structure formed depends on the length of the spacer separating the IRs. IRs with a long (1-kb) spacer are involved in inter-molecular single-strand annealing (SSA), leading to the formation of inverted dimers, while IRs with a short (12-bp) spacer participate in intra-molecular SSA, resulting in fold-back (FB) structures. Both structures interfere with accurate DSB repair by gene conversion and channel DSB repair into BIR, promoting genomic destabilization. Different protein complexes process FBs containing short versus long ssDNA loops, with the MRX-Sae2 complex processing FBs with short loops and the Rad1-Rad10 complex processing FBs with long loops. The presence of IRs near a DSB promotes BIR, leading to chromosomal rearrangements. The high abundance of IRs in the human genome suggests that these findings may contribute to understanding IR-mediated genomic destabilization associated with human disease.
Researchers have developed a new animal model using Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections in a living organism. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a type of bacteria that can cause infections in people with weakened immune systems. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces and are encased in a protective matrix, making them resistant to antibiotics and difficult to treat. In this study, the researchers infected fruit flies with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and found that the bacteria formed biofilms in the flies' crops, which are similar to biofilms formed in a lab dish. The biofilms in the flies had the same characteristics as lab-grown biofilms, including a matrix made of DNA and a sugar-like substance called exopolysaccharide. The researchers also found that the bacteria in the biofilms were more resistant to antibiotics than those that were not part of a biofilm. The study showed that the ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to form biofilms is important for its ability to cause disease in the flies. The researchers also found that the flies responded to the infection by producing antimicrobial peptides, which are proteins that help fight off infections. The study highlights the potential of using fruit flies as a model organism to study Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm infections and to develop new treatments for these infections.
Researchers studied the vasopressin receptor 1a gene (Avpr1a), which plays a key role in social behaviors, to understand how genetic variations contribute to differences in brain gene expression and behavior. They found that the proximal 5' flanking region of the gene contributes modestly to species differences in vasopressin receptor distribution in the brain. Additionally, a polymorphic microsatellite element within this region affects Avpr1a expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring some of the inter- and intra-species differences observed in central vasopressin receptor patterns. This study provides the first direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes can contribute to diversity in brain gene expression profiles. However, the results suggest that many features of species-specific expression patterns are mediated by elements outside of the immediate 5' flanking region of the gene. The study used homologous recombination in mice to replace the 5' flanking region of the Avpr1a gene with that of the prairie vole, resulting in a pattern of vasopressin receptor binding similar to that of prairie voles. This difference in receptor patterns led to increased affiliative behavior in response to vasopressin. The findings have implications for understanding the genomic mechanisms contributing to diversity in brain gene expression and behavior, and provide a model for exploring the relative contribution of species-specific regulatory elements and polymorphic repetitive elements in generating species-specific patterns and individual variation in brain gene expression.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Activation Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) can cause double-strand breaks in the DNA of yeast cells, leading to chromosomal translocations. This process is similar to what happens in human B cells, where AID is involved in class switch recombination and the development of certain types of cancer, such as Burkitt's lymphoma. The study used a yeast model system to investigate how AID causes DNA breaks and chromosomal rearrangements.

The researchers found that AID induces double-strand breaks in the immunoglobulin switch regions and the c-MYC gene in yeast cells that are impaired in a process called mRNP biogenesis. This process involves the formation of stable R-loops, which are structures that can trigger genome instability. The study suggests that AID-mediated deamination of cytosines in the switch regions is channeled into double-strand breaks, which are then repaired by a process called Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ).

The researchers also found that the c-MYC oncogene, which shares features with the switch regions, acts as a hotspot for recombination in yeast cells with impaired mRNP biogenesis. The study provides new insights into the role of mRNP biogenesis in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of AID-mediated genome instability. It also shows that yeast cells have the necessary factors and pathways to channel AID-mediated DNA lesions into double-strand breaks, which can lead to chromosomal rearrangements and cancer.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) divides its cells when the division process is not properly aligned with the cell's genetic material. They found that the protein FtsK can move up to 80% of the cell's chromosome (3.7 megabases of DNA) from one daughter cell to the other at an average speed of 1700 base pairs per second. This movement occurs at the late stages of cell division, when the cell has already started to separate into two parts. The researchers used a microscope to track the movement of DNA in E. coli cells grown in a controlled environment. They observed that the majority of DNA movement happens after the cell division protein ZipA has dissociated from the septum, a narrow channel that forms between the two daughter cells. The study suggests that the narrow constriction of the septum is necessary for FtsK to effectively move the DNA. The results show that E. coli cells can reposition their chromosomes even when the cell division plane is not properly localized, allowing them to produce viable offspring. The study provides new insights into how E. coli coordinates cell division and chromosome replication, and how it can adapt to situations where the division process is not properly aligned.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to optimize the selection of peptides for epitope-based vaccines. Epitope-based vaccines are designed to stimulate an immune response against specific antigens, and the selection of the right peptides is crucial for their effectiveness. However, the number of peptides that can be included in a vaccine is limited due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns. Additionally, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which present peptides to the immune system, vary between individuals, making it challenging to select a single set of peptides that will be effective for everyone.

The researchers used integer linear programming (ILP) to develop a framework that can select the optimal set of peptides from a given set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. The framework aims to maximize the likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response. The ILP approach allows for the incorporation of various immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen, coverage of all MHC alleles in a set, and avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates.

The framework has been implemented and tested on several examples, outperforming a simple greedy strategy and a previously suggested evolutionary algorithm. The solution of the ILP yields an optimal set of epitopes that displays the highest overall immunogenicity of all sets that meet the pre-defined requirements. The framework is flexible and can be adapted to different definitions of a "good vaccine," making it a valuable tool for the development of epitope-based vaccines.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in facilitating HIV-1 transmission to cervico-vaginal tissue. They used an ex vivo system of human cervico-vaginal tissue to simulate an in vivo situation, depositing HIV-1 on the tissue in combination with IL-7 at concentrations found in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. The study found that IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in the cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of T cells isolated from infected tissues showed that IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion by preventing apoptosis and increasing the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Additionally, IL-7 increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ T cells. The study suggests that high levels of IL-7 in semen may contribute to the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of HIV infection. The results demonstrate that IL-7 facilitates HIV-1 infection of cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissues ex vivo, and the findings have implications for understanding the role of IL-7 in male-to-female HIV-1 transmission.
Researchers studied how the Zika virus (ZIKV) interacts with the RNA interference (RNAi) system in Aedes aegypti mosquito cells. RNAi is a defense mechanism that helps mosquitoes fight off viral infections. The study found that ZIKV triggers the production of two types of small RNAs: siRNAs and piRNAs. However, the siRNAs produced in response to ZIKV do not have the typical characteristics of siRNAs, and the piRNAs do not have the expected molecular signature.

The researchers focused on the exogenous siRNA (exo-siRNA) pathway, which is a key antiviral response mechanism in mosquitoes. They found that ZIKV-specific siRNAs were produced and loaded into the Ago2 protein, but silencing Ago2 did not enhance virus replication. In contrast, knocking out the Dcr2 protein, which is involved in the exo-siRNA pathway, led to increased ZIKV replication. This suggests that the exo-siRNA pathway plays a role in defending against ZIKV.

The study also investigated the role of PIWI proteins, which are involved in the piRNA pathway. The researchers found that silencing different PIWI proteins did not enhance ZIKV replication, except for Piwi4, which displayed antiviral activity. Additionally, the study found that the ZIKV capsid protein amplified the replication of a reporter alphavirus, but did not inhibit the exo-siRNA pathway. Overall, the study provides new insights into the interactions between ZIKV and the RNAi system in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which is important for understanding the spread of the virus.
A recent study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, has found that a specific species of fungus, Sporothrix brasiliensis, is associated with atypical clinical presentations of sporotrichosis, a skin infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix. The study analyzed 50 patients with different forms of sporotrichosis and found that those infected with S. brasiliensis had distinct symptoms and treatment outcomes compared to those infected with another species, S. schenckii.

Patients infected with S. brasiliensis were more likely to have disseminated cutaneous infection, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection, whereas those infected with S. schenckii had less severe and more localized disease. Notably, patients infected with S. brasiliensis required shorter treatment durations with the antifungal medication itraconazole compared to those infected with S. schenckii.

This study is the first to demonstrate a link between the genetic identification of Sporothrix species and various clinical aspects of human sporotrichosis. The findings suggest that different species of Sporothrix are associated with different clinical manifestations of the disease, and that S. brasiliensis is effectively treated with oral itraconazole. The study's results have important implications for the diagnosis and treatment of sporotrichosis, and highlight the need for careful speciation of Sporothrix isolates to guide clinical care.
Recent studies suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts were unclear. Researchers used RNA-Seq and tiling arrays to analyze transcripts in human and mouse tissues. They found that RNA-Seq identified fewer transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs compared to tiling arrays. Most non-exonic transcribed regions were within introns, suggesting they may be fragments of pre-mRNAs. The chromosomal locations of many intergenic transcribed regions were near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation site usage, promoter- and terminator-associated transcripts, or new alternative exons. Reads that bridged splice sites identified 4,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes.

The majority of intergenic transcribed regions had low sequence coverage, with 70-80% of the transcribed area detected by a single RNA-Seq read in only one sample. Tiling arrays were found to be poorly suited for detecting low-level transcripts. The majority of non-exonic transcripts were associated with known genes, including thousands of new alternative exons and hundreds of alternative promoters. A genome-wide analysis of "de novo" splice junctions revealed 2,789 previously uncharacterized transcript fragments, 1,259 of which mapped to intergenic regions. The intergenic regions that were transcribed above background levels consisted of a mix of coding and non-coding transcripts. Overall, the study found that while there are some new intergenic transcripts, their number and abundance are generally low compared to known exons, and the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.
Scientists have developed a new method to make proteins more stable at high temperatures, which can be useful for studying microorganisms that thrive in hot environments. This method combines computer simulations with laboratory experiments to identify and improve the thermostability of a specific protein called the Bacillus subtilis YtvA LOV domain. The YtvA LOV domain is a fluorescent protein that can be used to study anaerobic microorganisms, but it is not very stable at high temperatures.

   The researchers used a five-step process to improve the protein's thermostability. First, they used computer simulations to identify potential mutations that could make the protein more stable. They then tested these mutations in the laboratory and selected the most promising ones. Next, they used computer simulations again to design new mutations that could further improve the protein's stability. They tested these new mutations in the laboratory and selected the best ones. Finally, they combined multiple mutations to create an even more stable version of the protein.

   The new method was successful in increasing the thermostability of the YtvA LOV domain by 31 degrees Celsius, making it suitable for use in thermophilic systems. The researchers believe that this method can be used to improve the thermostability of other proteins that are difficult to stabilize using other methods.
Researchers studied the diversity of Lutzomyia sand flies on Barro Colorado Island in Panama to understand their role in spreading leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania. They found 18 species of sand flies, including two previously unknown species, and detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapidoi and 26.3% of Lu. gomezi individuals. The Leishmania species infecting these sand flies was identified as Leishmania (viannia) naiffi, which is known to cause cutaneous leishmaniasis in South America but had not been reported in Panama before. This suggests that Le. naiffi may have recently expanded its range to the Isthmus or was introduced to the area.

The researchers also detected Wolbachia, a bacterium that can be used to control insect populations, in three sand fly species, including Lu. trapidoi, which frequently co-occurs with Leishmania. This finding identifies Lu. trapidoi as a potential target for using Wolbachia to control the spread of leishmaniasis. The study highlights the importance of understanding the diversity of sand fly species and their relationships with Leishmania and Wolbachia to develop effective strategies for mitigating the impact of this disease in humans. Further research is needed to survey sand fly populations across the Isthmus of Panama and to test the effectiveness of using Wolbachia to control the spread of leishmaniasis.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that can cause serious health problems, especially in people with weakened immune systems. Researchers have been trying to understand what triggers HCMV to reactivate from a dormant state in immune cells called dendritic cells (DCs). A team of scientists has discovered that a protein called CREB plays a crucial role in this process. CREB binds to a specific region of the HCMV genome called the major immediate early promoter (MIEP), which is necessary for the virus to start producing new copies of itself.

The researchers found that another protein called MSK (mitogen and stress-activated kinase) works together with CREB to reactivate HCMV from latency. MSK helps to modify the structure of the chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins, around the MIEP, making it easier for the virus to start producing new copies of itself. This process involves the phosphorylation of a protein called histone H3, which is a key component of chromatin.

The study suggests that inhibiting the interaction between CREB and MSK could be a potential strategy for treating HCMV infections. The researchers used a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to demonstrate the importance of CREB and MSK in HCMV reactivation. Their findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of HCMV latency and reactivation, and highlight the potential for developing new therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat HCMV infections.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for a protein called Nol11 in the development of the face and head in vertebrates. Nol11 is involved in the production of ribosomes, which are essential for all living cells. Defects in ribosome production have been linked to various genetic disorders, known as ribosomopathies. The study, conducted in frogs, found that Nol11 is highly expressed in the developing neural crest, a group of cells that give rise to the face and head. When Nol11 was knocked down in frogs, the production of ribosomes was impaired, leading to increased cell death and abnormal development of the facial cartilages.

The researchers also found that the protein p53, which is involved in cell death, was activated in response to the impaired ribosome production. However, when p53 was inhibited, the facial phenotype was partially rescued, but the ribosome production defect remained. This suggests that the relationship between ribosome production and cell survival is tightly regulated. The study provides new insights into the role of Nol11 in craniofacial development and highlights the importance of ribosome production in the development of the face and head. The findings also provide a new model for studying ribosomopathies, which could lead to a better understanding of these disorders and the development of new treatments.
Researchers have developed a new approach to diagnose leptospirosis, a life-threatening disease caused by the bacterium Leptospira interrogans. The current lack of an effective diagnostic test is a major barrier to treating the disease, especially in its early stages. To address this issue, scientists created a protein microarray chip containing 2,421 proteins, representing 61% of the Leptospira interrogans proteome. They tested the chip with serum samples from 274 individuals, including patients with acute and convalescent leptospirosis, as well as healthy controls from regions with varying levels of endemic transmission.

The study identified 16 antigens that can distinguish between acute cases and healthy individuals from areas with high endemic transmission, and 18 antigens that distinguish convalescent cases. Some of these antigens, such as LipL32 and GroEL, are already known to be recognized by human antibodies, validating the approach. The researchers also identified several novel antigens, including the hypothetical protein LIC10215, which showed high sensitivity and specificity for both acute and convalescent patients.

This study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptospiral infection. The novel antigens identified may have potential use in developing new diagnostic tests and improving existing ones for this neglected tropical disease. Further research is needed to assess the utility of these antigens in more deployable diagnostic platforms.
Researchers studied the immune response of mosquitoes to a fungus called Beauveria bassiana, which infects and kills mosquitoes. They used the malaria-carrying mosquito species Anopheles gambiae as a model to investigate how mosquitoes defend against this fungus. The study found that mosquitoes produce melanin, a pigment that helps fight off infections, in response to the fungus. However, the melanin did not stop the fungus from growing, and the fungus continued to spread despite being melanized. The researchers discovered that the melanization response is triggered by two key proteins, TEP1 and CLIPA8, which work together to recruit an enzyme called phenoloxidase to the surface of the fungus. When these proteins were silenced, the melanization response was abolished, and the fungus grew more rapidly in the mosquitoes. In fact, mosquitoes with silenced TEP1 and CLIPA8 were more susceptible to natural infections with B. bassiana. The study suggests that the melanization response plays a role in slowing down the growth of the fungus, but not in completely stopping it. This finding could be used to develop transgenic fungi that are more effective at controlling mosquito populations. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex interactions between mosquitoes and entomopathogenic fungi, and highlights the need for further research into the mechanisms of mosquito immunity.
Researchers investigated the potential of four compounds to prevent dengue virus infection in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti. The compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), mycophenolic acid (MPA), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxynojirimycin (DNJ), are known to inhibit dengue virus host factors (DENV HFs) in mammalian cells. The researchers tested these compounds using various methods, including injection, sugar feeding, and blood feeding, and found that BAF and MPA were effective in reducing dengue virus titers in the mosquito midgut and salivary gland. Specifically, injection of BAF and MPA prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited dengue virus titers by 56% and 60% in the midgut, and by 90% and 83% in the salivary gland, respectively. Ingestion of BAF and MPA through a sugar meal or together with an infectious blood meal also resulted in various degrees of virus inhibition. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of vATPase subunit genes and the IMPDH gene also reduced dengue virus infection, indicating that BAF- and MPA-mediated virus inhibition occurred through the inhibition of these DENV HFs. The study suggests that chemical inhibition or RNAi-mediated depletion of vATPase and IMPDH can be used to suppress dengue virus infection in adult Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which may lead to a reduction in dengue transmission.
Researchers have investigated the role of cell volume in the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. These conditions involve excessive neuronal depolarization and are characterized by changes in ion concentrations across the cell membrane. The study used a mathematical model that incorporates cell swelling, dynamic ion concentrations, and oxygen supply to understand how cell volume affects neuronal behavior. The results show that cell volume can act as a bifurcation parameter, meaning that small changes in cell volume can lead to significant changes in neuronal behavior.

The study found that cell swelling can trigger a spontaneous transition between seizure and spreading depression states. The researchers also identified a "physiological ceiling" that separates seizure from spreading depression, and a second ceiling that demarcates spreading depression from anoxic depolarization. The study suggests that glial cells play a neuroprotective role against seizures and spreading depression by buffering potassium ions.

The findings provide new insights into the dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization, and highlight the importance of considering cell volume, ion concentrations, and oxygen homeostasis in understanding these conditions. The study proposes a unified framework for understanding a wide range of neuronal behaviors, which may lead to the development of universal intervention strategies for these pathological states.
Researchers studied how the body's immune system responds to a type of fungus called Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which causes a disease called paracoccidioidomycosis in Latin America. They found that the immune system uses a complex called the NLRP3 inflammasome to fight off this fungus. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a group of proteins that helps to activate a cytokine called IL-1β, which is a key player in the immune response. When the fungus infects immune cells called dendritic cells, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated, leading to the release of IL-1β. This cytokine then helps to activate other immune cells, called macrophages, to kill the fungus.

The researchers also found that the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome is dependent on several factors, including the release of potassium ions, the production of reactive oxygen species, and the acidification of phagolysosomes. They used mice that were unable to produce IL-1β to show that this cytokine plays a crucial role in killing the fungus. The study suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome is an important part of the immune system's defense against Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection. Further research is needed to understand the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β in protecting against this disease.
Toxoplasma gondii is a brain-tropic parasite that infects most nucleated cells, including neurons and astrocytes, in the central nervous system (CNS). However, research has shown that in vivo, Toxoplasma is primarily found in neurons, not astrocytes. A new study used a novel Toxoplasma-mouse model to investigate why this is the case. The model allowed researchers to mark and track host cells that interact with the parasite, even if the interaction is transient. The results showed that Toxoplasma has a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection, regardless of the presence of interferon-γ, a protein that helps clear the parasite from astrocytes. This suggests that neurons are not incidentally infected, but rather are the primary target cells for Toxoplasma in the brain. The study found that neurons consistently made up the majority of the cells that interacted with the parasite, regardless of the time point or strain of Toxoplasma used. This research provides new insights into how Toxoplasma establishes a persistent brain infection, which affects up to 1/3 of the world's population. Understanding how the parasite interacts with host cells could lead to the development of therapies to eliminate persistent pathogens like Toxoplasma.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to explain how cells move and change direction. The model focuses on the mechanical interactions between actin and myosin, two proteins that play a crucial role in cell movement. The model shows that the movement of a cell depends on three key factors: the strength of myosin contractility, the viscosity of the actin network, and the rate of actin growth at the cell boundary.

When myosin contractility is weak, the cell remains stationary and symmetrical. However, above a certain threshold, the cell becomes motile and can move in different directions. The direction of movement depends on the boundary conditions, such as the shape of the cell and the rate of actin growth. The model also shows that a positive feedback loop between myosin asymmetry, actin flow, and cell movement is essential for stable motility.

The researchers used simulations to test the model and found that the aspect ratio of a steadily moving cell varies between 1 and 3, which is consistent with experimental observations. The model also predicts that cells can turn by accumulating myosin in a small region at the cell rear, which destabilizes the axial symmetry of the moving cell. This suggests that the contractile mechanism of motility supports robust cell turning in certain conditions. Overall, the model provides new insights into the mechanical basis of cell movement and directionality.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the accuracy of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, which are complex maps of how proteins interact with each other. PPI networks are crucial for understanding how cells function, but they are often noisy and incomplete due to experimental errors. For example, yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and a false negative rate of 43-71%. The new method, called geometric de-noising, uses a geometric graph model to assess the confidence levels of interactions in PPI networks and predict new ones. It achieves a specificity of 85% and sensitivity of 90%. The method was applied to the human PPI network and predicted 251 interactions, a statistically significant fraction of which correspond to protein pairs sharing common gene ontology (GO) terms. The predicted interactions were also validated in the HPRD database and a newer release of BioGRID. The method does not require multiple PPI datasets or a priori information about individual proteins, making it a useful tool for researchers. The data and Matlab code implementing the method are freely available online.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that may contribute to the development of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a genetic disorder that affects muscle and nerve cells. The study used fruit flies (Drosophila) as a model to investigate how a specific type of genetic mutation, known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion, causes the disease. The researchers found that when two types of expanded repeat transcripts, CTG and CAG, are expressed together in the flies, it leads to increased toxicity and the generation of small RNA molecules called siRNAs. These siRNAs target specific genes that contain long CAG repeats, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein (TBP), which are also affected in humans with DM1. The study suggests that the generation of these siRNAs may play a significant role in the development of DM1 and potentially other diseases caused by trinucleotide repeat expansions. The findings have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of these diseases and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies. The researchers used a Drosophila model to recapitulate the key features of DM1, including the formation of RNA accumulations in muscle nuclei and affected alternative splicing. The study highlights the importance of considering the role of anti-sense transcription in the development of trinucleotide repeat diseases.
Researchers have re-examined the phylogeny and virulence of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3193, a model soft rot pathogen isolated from a diseased potato stem in Finland in the 1980s. Genomic analysis revealed that SCC3193, previously classified as Pectobacterium carotovorum, is actually a member of the species Pectobacterium wasabiae. This reclassification indicates that P. wasabiae has been present in potato fields worldwide, although it has gone unnoticed. The study also identified novel virulence determinants in P. wasabiae, including a putative transcriptional regulator, two type VI secretion systems, and two horizontally acquired clusters containing predicted virulence genes. These determinants contribute to the bacterium's ability to cause disease in plants. In contrast to other soft rot bacteria, P. wasabiae lacks a type III secretion system, which is a key virulence factor in other soft rot species. The study's findings provide new insights into the biology of P. wasabiae and suggest that soft rot bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits that may be used during the latent stage of infection. The research provides a solid foundation for further investigation into the virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft rot bacteria and potentially other bacteria as well.
Researchers used a network analysis approach to study how mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, change when their DNA is depleted. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion is linked to various human diseases, including aging and cell death. The study focused on nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins (mt proteome), which are crucial for mitochondrial function. By analyzing gene expression data, the researchers identified two main subnetworks of proteins that were either up-regulated or down-regulated in response to mtDNA depletion. The down-regulated proteins were involved in typical mitochondrial functions, such as energy production and protein folding, while the up-regulated proteins were involved in mtDNA repair and regulation of protein expression and transport. The study found that cells attempted to compensate for mtDNA depletion by modulating the coordinated expression and transport of mt proteins. This suggests that the composition of mt proteins changes to remodel the functional organization of mitochondrial protein networks in response to dysfunctional cellular states. The findings provide a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions and may have implications for understanding human diseases related to mtDNA damage. The study's data-integrative approach and network analysis can be valuable for the computational biology community working on gene expression and proteomics analysis.
Researchers have developed a new method to determine the rates of complex biological processes that occur within living cells, such as protein synthesis. These processes involve multiple steps, including molecular interactions, chemical reactions, and mechanical movements, which are difficult to measure directly in living cells. The new method, called the kinetic distance, allows scientists to compare the rates of these processes in a laboratory setting (in vitro) to those that occur within living cells (in vivo). The kinetic distance is a mathematical concept that quantifies the similarity or difference between the rates of a process in vitro and in vivo. By minimizing the kinetic distance between the in vitro and in vivo rates, the method can accurately predict the in vivo rates of a process. The researchers applied this method to protein synthesis, a key process in gene expression, and found that the predicted in vivo rates agreed with experimental data without requiring any additional adjustments. The method also revealed that the initial selection of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules plays a crucial role in reducing error frequencies during protein synthesis. This new approach can be applied to other biomolecular processes, providing a powerful tool for understanding complex biological systems. The method is computationally simple and relies on detailed information about the in vitro kinetics of the process.
Researchers studied the evolution of Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that infects humans, over short and long periods of time. They analyzed DNA sequences from 97 isolates of the bacteria, including 34 pairs of sequential samples from the same host and 29 single isolates from 10 families. The study found that the accumulation of genetic diversity in the bacteria increased over time in a predictable manner, similar to a clock.

The researchers estimated the rate of genetic mutations and recombination in the bacteria. They found that the short-term mutation rate was between 1.4×10−6 and 4.5×10−6 per nucleotide per year, with recombination introducing three times as many genetic changes as mutations. The study also found that the long-term mutation rate over thousands of years was 5-17 times lower due to the removal of harmful mutations through natural selection.

The researchers compared their findings to previous studies on other bacterial species and found that the short-term mutation rate can vary greatly between species, spanning several orders of magnitude. They also estimated the long-term mutation rate by analyzing genetic diversity between H. pylori isolates from different parts of the world, which had diverged over the past 60,000 years. The study's results provide new insights into the evolutionary processes of H. pylori and highlight the importance of considering short-term and long-term mutation rates when studying bacterial evolution.
Researchers have found that melanopsin, a type of photopigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in the thalamo-cortical visual system. These cells, known as mRGCs, are responsible for driving reflex light responses such as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. However, their contribution to conventional visual pathways had not been directly assessed until now.

Using new reporter lines, scientists discovered that mRGC projections are more extensive than previously thought and extend across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. They found that this input supports physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex in mice lacking rods and cones, a model of advanced retinal degeneration.

The researchers also isolated melanopsin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system using chromatic stimuli and found strong melanopsin input to approximately 40% of neurons in the LGN that show sustained activation to a light step. They demonstrated that this melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons.

The study's findings suggest that melanopsin-based photoreception provides unique irradiance information and allows visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods and cones. This discovery identifies mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicates that they may support vision in people suffering from retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection is associated with a significant depletion of mucosal memory CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating the immune response to microbial and food antigens. Researchers investigated whether this depletion affects the body's ability to produce antibodies in response to these antigens. The study found that HIV-1-infected individuals have reduced IgG responses to certain types of bacteria, such as Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but not Bacteroidetes. In addition, the study found that antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals have elevated levels of IgM antibodies in their intestinal secretions and decreased IgA/IgM and IgG/IgM ratios of antibodies specific to microbial and food antigens. This suggests that the body's ability to switch from producing IgM to other types of antibodies, such as IgA and IgG, is impaired in HIV-1-infected individuals. This impairment may contribute to the translocation of microbial antigens across the intestinal mucosal barrier and chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. The study also found that HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4+ T cell counts have reduced levels of plasma IgG specific to certain types of bacteria. Overall, the study provides new insights into the dysregulation of systemic and mucosal humoral responses in HIV-1 infection and highlights the importance of CD4+ T cells in regulating the immune response to microbial and food antigens.
Researchers have developed a new model to study population dynamics in ecosystems where resources are limited. In these systems, the growth of one population must be balanced by the decline of others. The new model introduces a mechanism where a sudden collapse of a dominant population frees up resources for other species, leading to "diversity waves" in the ecosystem. These waves are characterized by a peak in population diversity at the beginning, followed by an exponential decline.

The model shows that species abundances have a bimodal distribution, with one peak consisting of recently collapsed or newly introduced species and the other peak consisting of species that have not yet collapsed. This self-organized hierarchical structure has a long-term memory and gives rise to a scale-free tail in the time-aggregated population distribution. The model is robust to variations in parameters such as diffusion between environments, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hedging strategies.

The researchers tested the model using simulations and found that it preserves the general patterns of collapse-driven dynamics, including diversity waves and a broad time-aggregated distribution of population sizes. They also found that the classic definition of fitness in terms of long-term exponential growth rate is not applicable to this model, as the long-term growth rate of each species is zero. The model provides a new framework for understanding population dynamics in ecosystems where resources are limited and episodic catastrophes occur.
Scientists have long studied how the bacteria Escherichia coli (E. coli) navigate their environment using a process called chemotaxis. Chemotaxis is the ability to move towards or away from certain chemicals, which is crucial for the bacteria's survival. E. coli uses a sensory system to detect changes in chemical concentrations and adjusts its movement accordingly. The bacteria's flagella, or whip-like structures, rotate to propel the cell forward or backward, allowing it to move up or down a chemical gradient.

Previous research has shown that E. coli's chemotaxis system is highly optimized, allowing it to efficiently move up a chemical gradient. However, a new study suggests that there may be an additional mechanism at play. Using computer simulations, the researchers found that the degree of reorientation during a tumble, or a sudden change in direction, also depends on the swimming direction along the gradient. This fine-tuning of the tumble angle results in a significant enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient.

The researchers used a hybrid model of chemotactic E. coli to investigate the relationship between the number of flagellar motors and the tumbling angle. They found that the difference in mean tumbling angles up and down the gradient is small, but it has a dramatic effect on the bacteria's ability to move up the gradient. This new level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria, indicating a further level of evolutionary development of bacterial chemotaxis.
Researchers have discovered that the Stat3 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs), which are essential for establishing central tolerance in the immune system. mTECs express self-peptides that help eliminate autoreactive immune cells and promote the development of regulatory T cells. The study found that activating the Stat3 pathway in mTEC precursors leads to increased cellularity and proper formation of the medullary region in the thymus. Conversely, deleting Stat3 in mTECs disrupts the medullary region's architecture and reduces the number of mTECs.

The researchers also found that Stat3 signaling promotes the survival of immature mTEC precursors, but does not affect their proliferation. This suggests that Stat3 plays a key role in maintaining the balance of mTECs in the thymus. The study's findings demonstrate that, in addition to the well-characterized NFκB pathway, Stat3-mediated signaling is essential for optimal development and maintenance of the thymic medullary compartment.

The study's results show that targeting a constitutively active Stat3 transgene to the mTEC compartment increases mTEC cellularity and expands the thymic medulla, while conditional deletion of Stat3 reduces mTEC cellularity and impairs medullary region formation. Overall, the study highlights the importance of Stat3 signaling in regulating mTEC cellularity and medullary region homeostasis in the thymus.
Researchers have identified a large number of small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) in the human pathogen Clostridium difficile. These sRNAs play a crucial role in the bacterium's physiology and pathogenesis. Using a combination of computational and experimental approaches, the researchers identified 511 sRNA candidates in both intergenic and coding regions of the C. difficile genome. Of these, 251 were found to be putative regulatory sRNAs, including 94 potential trans-riboregulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches.

The researchers used RNA-seq and differential 5'-end RNA-seq to validate these predictions and identify the transcriptional start sites of the sRNAs under different growth conditions. They found that some sRNAs, including an antisense RNA involved in controlling C. difficile's autolytic activity, showed growth phase-dependent expression profiles. Additionally, 16 predicted c-di-GMP-responsive riboswitches were found to be expressed, and their regulatory role in controlling motility and biofilm formation was confirmed.

The study also identified abundant sRNAs encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci, which may be important for the bacterium's survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities. The discovery of these sRNAs provides a foundation for future research into the molecular mechanisms of sRNA-based regulation of gene expression in C. difficile.
Researchers have found that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein plays a key role in reducing the levels of a microRNA called miR-122 in the liver. miR-122 is essential for liver development and metabolism, and it also helps the HCV virus to replicate. The study discovered that the HCV core protein inhibits an enzyme called GLD-2, which is responsible for adding nucleotides to the 3' end of miR-122, making it more stable. By inhibiting GLD-2, the HCV core protein reduces the levels of miR-122, which in turn affects the virus's ability to replicate.

The researchers analyzed liver biopsies from patients with HCV and found that the levels of miR-122 were significantly lower in these patients compared to healthy individuals. They also found that the HCV core protein specifically inhibits GLD-2, which is responsible for adding nucleotides to the 3' end of miR-122. This inhibition leads to a decrease in the levels of miR-122, which is essential for the virus's life cycle.

The study also found that the HCV core protein affects not only miR-122 but also other microRNAs in the liver. The researchers detected various miR-122 species in the liver, ranging from 16 to 25 nucleotides in length, and found that the HCV infection interferes with the 3' end tailing of miR-122. The study provides new insights into the regulatory role of the HCV core protein in controlling viral RNA abundance and miR-122 functions through miR-122 stability modulation.
Researchers have found evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomes in wild African lions in the Serengeti. Trypanosomes are parasites that cause disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. The study discovered a pattern in the age prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei infections in lions, which suggests that the animals develop immunity to the parasite as they age. This immunity is likely due to exposure to other trypanosome species, such as Trypanosoma congolense, which are more genetically diverse. As a result, lions are able to clear most infections of T. brucei by the age of 3-5 years and eliminate all infections of T. brucei rhodesiense, the causative agent of human sleeping sickness, by the age of 6 years. This finding is significant because it challenges the long-held assumption that immunity to trypanosomes is impossible, which has hindered the development of vaccines against the disease. The study's results suggest that acquired immunity may be a viable strategy for preventing trypanosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people and animals in sub-Saharan Africa. The discovery of acquired immunity in lions may also have implications for the development of vaccines against the disease, particularly in regions where cattle act as a major reservoir of human infection.
Researchers developed a mathematical model of the human coagulation cascade, a complex process that leads to blood clot formation. They used this model to identify points of fragility, or weaknesses, in the cascade that could be targeted by therapeutic interventions. The model was validated using 21 published datasets from two different in vitro coagulation models, and it accurately predicted the effects of natural anticoagulants on thrombin generation and platelet activation. The researchers found that certain mechanisms, such as fluid and surface phase factor X/activated factor X activity and thrombin-mediated platelet activation, were fragile, while others, such as factor IX/IXa and factor VIII/VIIIa activation and activity, were robust. These findings are consistent with current therapeutic strategies, including the use of anti-factor X/activated factor X and direct thrombin inhibitors. The model's predictions were also supported by in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence. The study suggests that computationally derived points of fragility of human relevant cascades could be used as a rational basis for target selection despite model uncertainty. However, further refinement of the model is needed to account for pro- and anti-platelet activation mechanisms operating on the endothelium and to explore the robustness of factor IX mechanisms using in vivo animal models or cell-based assays.
Researchers studied how bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, interact with the food-borne pathogen Campylobacter jejuni in a laboratory setting. They used a combination of experiments and mathematical models to understand the dynamics of this interaction. The goal was to develop a better understanding of how phage therapy, the use of bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents, could be effective in controlling bacterial populations.

The study found that phage-insensitive populations of C. jejuni arose quickly, and that a simple mathematical model was surprisingly effective in predicting the behavior of the phage-bacteria interaction. The researchers used this model to estimate key parameters, such as the "inundation threshold," which is the point at which the phage population becomes too low to effectively control the bacterial population, and the "proliferation threshold," which is the point at which the phage population becomes too high and starts to decline.

The study also highlighted the importance of understanding the non-linear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions, which can lead to unexpected outcomes, such as the resurgence of bacterial populations due to the presence of partially-resistant cells. The researchers suggest that a threshold-based understanding of phage-bacteria interactions is crucial for the development of effective phage therapy. Overall, the study demonstrates the value of combining experimental and modeling approaches to gain a deeper understanding of phage-bacteria interactions and to inform the development of phage therapy.
Researchers have identified a novel Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomiasis, caused by S. mansoni, affects over 260 million people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The snail acts as an intermediate host for the parasite, and understanding the snail's immune response is essential for developing disease prevention and control strategies.

The researchers discovered the TLR, named BgTLR, through a peptide screen of snail immune cell surface proteins that differed in abundance between resistant and susceptible snail strains. The resistant strain, BS-90, displayed higher levels of BgTLR compared to the susceptible M-line strain. When challenged with S. mansoni, the resistant snails showed a significant increase in BgTLR expression, while the susceptible snails did not. Knocking down BgTLR in the resistant snails using siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, leading to patent infections in 43% of the normally resistant snails.

This study provides the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR and demonstrates that BgTLR is an important snail immune receptor that influences infection outcome following S. mansoni challenge. The findings have significant implications for understanding the molecular basis of the interactions between schistosomes and their snail hosts, and may lead to the identification of new targets for disease prevention and control efforts.
Researchers in French Polynesia have developed a new tool to measure human exposure to disease-carrying mosquitoes. Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis mosquitoes are responsible for spreading diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis in the region. To assess the risk of disease transmission and evaluate the effectiveness of vector control programs, scientists created an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to detect antibodies in human blood. These antibodies are produced in response to the saliva of the mosquitoes.

The study found that 98% of people in Tahiti and 68% of people in Moorea, where both mosquito species are present, have developed antibodies against the saliva of Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesiensis, respectively. In contrast, only 3% of people from metropolitan France, where these mosquitoes are not present, had antibodies against the mosquito saliva. The researchers also found that the antibodies were specific to each mosquito species, meaning they did not cross-react with each other.

This new tool can help identify areas where disease transmission risk is high and evaluate the effectiveness of vector control strategies in Pacific islands and other tropical settings. It can also provide valuable information on human exposure to mosquito bites, which is essential for developing targeted public health interventions. The study's findings suggest that the presence of antibodies against mosquito saliva can be a reliable indicator of human exposure to these disease-carrying mosquitoes.
Researchers have found that the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) adapts to the human body's immune cells, called macrophages, by manipulating the cells' metabolic processes. This adaptation allows Mtb to survive and thrive within the macrophages, which is a key factor in the development of tuberculosis (TB) disease. By studying the metabolic changes in macrophages infected with different strains of Mtb, the researchers discovered that the bacterium targets specific metabolic pathways in the host cells to promote its own survival and growth.

The study found that Mtb's ability to regulate the host cell's metabolism is crucial for its pathogenicity, or ability to cause disease. The researchers identified a subset of metabolic reactions that are targeted by the bacterium, which allows it to balance its own needs with the needs of the host cell. This balance is essential for the bacterium to survive and replicate within the macrophage.

Interestingly, the study also found that the host's metabolic status, particularly blood sugar levels, plays a significant role in determining the severity of TB disease. Individuals with high blood sugar levels, such as those with diabetes, are more susceptible to TB infection. The researchers suggest that this is because high blood sugar levels compromise the host's immune response, making it easier for Mtb to infect and cause disease. This finding highlights the importance of considering metabolic factors in the development of TB and may lead to new approaches for understanding and treating the disease.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZHP-3 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during meiosis. Meiosis is the process by which sex cells, or gametes, are produced, and it involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. This exchange, known as crossover recombination, is essential for the proper segregation of chromosomes during the first meiotic division. ZHP-3 is the C. elegans ortholog of the budding yeast ZIP3 gene, which is also involved in crossover recombination.

The study found that ZHP-3 protein localization is highly dynamic during meiosis, shifting from along the length of the synaptonemal complex (SC) to an asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually becoming restricted to foci that mark crossover recombination events. The researchers created a ZHP-3::GFP transgene, which partially complements a null mutation and reveals a separation of function. While the fusion protein can promote nearly wild-type levels of recombination, aneuploidy among the progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic chromosome segregation.

The study also found that the structure of bivalents is perturbed in ZHP-3 mutants, suggesting that the chromosome segregation defect results from an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. The researchers propose that coordination of crossover recombination with SC disassembly and bivalent formation reflects a conserved role of Zip3/ZHP-3 in coupling recombination with SC morphogenesis.
Aedes albopictus, a tropical mosquito species, has spread to temperate regions of Europe and the US, posing a public health concern due to its ability to transmit diseases and cause nuisance. Researchers investigated the factors affecting the abundance and dynamics of Aedes albopictus in the metropolitan area of Rome, Italy, which is one of the most infested areas in Southern Europe. The study analyzed data from 21 stations along a 70 km transect, using sticky traps to collect and count mosquitoes over an 18-week period.

The results showed that Aedes albopictus abundance is associated with highly urbanized habitats in both metropolitan and suburban/rural areas. In metropolitan areas, "small green islands" were found to be hotspots of abundance. The study also found a bimodal seasonal dynamics, with a second peak of abundance in autumn, linked to heavy rainfall and permissive temperatures. In contrast, an increase in vegetation cover was found to be negatively associated with mosquito abundance.

The findings suggest that public mosquito control measures should be prioritized in temperate urban areas, where the risk of nuisance, human-mosquito contact, and local arbovirus transmission is higher. The study highlights the potential public health risks associated with Aedes albopictus even after the summer months typically associated with high mosquito densities.
Researchers have discovered that phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), a key virulence factor of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), play a crucial role in the bacterium's ability to invade host macrophages. Macrophages are a type of immune cell that engulf and digest foreign particles and microorganisms. The study found that DIM helps Mtb to be taken up by macrophages through a process called receptor-dependent phagocytosis. This process involves the binding of Mtb to specific receptors on the surface of the macrophage, which triggers the engulfment of the bacterium.

The researchers also found that DIM helps to prevent the acidification of the phagosome, a membrane-bound compartment within the macrophage that contains the engulfed Mtb. Acidification of the phagosome would normally help to kill the bacterium, but DIM prevents this from happening, allowing Mtb to survive and replicate within the macrophage.

The study suggests that DIM achieves these effects by modifying the organization of lipids in the plasma membrane of the macrophage. Specifically, DIM causes changes in the fluidity and polarity of the membrane, making it more favorable for Mtb to be taken up by the macrophage. The researchers propose that this is a key mechanism by which Mtb evades the host immune response and establishes a protective niche within the macrophage.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the behavior of small neural networks, which are composed of a few tens of neurons. These networks are too small to be accurately described by mean-field approximations, which are commonly used to study larger neural networks. The new method allows for a systematic analysis of the dynamics of these small networks, including the study of local and global bifurcations. Bifurcations are points at which the behavior of the network changes qualitatively, such as from a stable to an unstable state.

The researchers found that small neural networks with strong inhibitory connections exhibit complex dynamics, including the formation of multiple branching solutions of the neural dynamics equations. This phenomenon, known as spontaneous symmetry-breaking, is a finite-size effect that reveals differences between mesoscopic cortical circuits and their mean-field approximation. The ability of small networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity is thought to help reduce the detrimental effects of noise correlations on cortical information processing.

The new method is an extension of previous work by Beer, who studied the bifurcations of networks with highly symmetric assumptions on synaptic weights. However, the new method is more biologically plausible and can be applied to networks of arbitrary size. The researchers used a deterministic finite-size firing-rate network model to derive exact expressions of the bifurcation manifolds, allowing for a more accurate description of the behavior of small neural networks.
Researchers investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extralesional sites, such as blood monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin, of patients with dermal leishmaniasis. They used a specific RNA target, Leishmania 7SLRNA, to detect and quantify the parasites. The study found that viable Leishmania parasites were present in extralesional sites in 100% of patients with kDNA in these tissues. The parasites were most frequently detected in blood monocytes, followed by tonsil swabs and healthy skin aspirates. The researchers also found that the copy number of 7SLRNA transcripts was correlated with the number of viable Leishmania parasites, indicating that this target can be used to determine the status of infection and monitor treatment. The study suggests that Leishmania parasites can disseminate to extralesional sites without triggering pathogenesis, and that the detection and quantification of parasites in these sites is important for understanding the natural history of human infection. The researchers conclude that amplification of 7SLRNA genes and transcripts can be used to establish Leishmania viability, parasite burden, and infection of extralesional tissues, providing a new tool for clinical and epidemiologic investigations of human leishmaniasis.
Researchers have found a way to predict when and where DNA replication occurs in fruit flies using a combination of chromatin features. Chromatin is the complex of DNA, histone proteins, and other molecules that make up chromosomes. Histone modifications (HMs) and chromatin-binding proteins (CBPs) play a crucial role in regulating DNA replication. However, no single HM is essential for DNA replication, suggesting that HMs may work together in a specific pattern, similar to how they regulate gene expression.

Using a comprehensive dataset of 95 CBPs and HMs, the researchers developed a statistical model that can accurately predict DNA replication timing across the Drosophila genome. They found that combinations of CBPs and pairwise interactions between HMs are key to achieving accurate predictions. The model was able to predict replication timing with high accuracy genome-wide and across different cell types.

The researchers also discovered that specific combinations of HMs can predict differential DNA replication timing across different cell types. This suggests that combinatorial HM patterns may contribute to the regulation of DNA replication timing. The study provides evidence for the existence of combinatorial HM patterns for DNA replication and identifies key elements that can be further investigated to understand the regulatory mechanisms of this fundamental cellular process.
Researchers studied the spread of dengue virus in Brazil and found that air travel plays a significant role in the spread of the virus within the country. The study focused on three serotypes of the virus: DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3. By analyzing complete genome sequences, the researchers estimated that new lineages of the virus are introduced to Brazil every 7 to 10 years. These new lineages are most likely to come from the Caribbean region and then spread to other parts of the country at a rate of approximately 0.5 km per day.

The study used a statistical framework to determine the factors that contribute to the spread of the virus. The researchers found that aerial transportation of humans and/or mosquito vectors, rather than the presence of the Aedes aegypti mosquito or geographical distances, is the main driver of dengue virus spread in Brazil. The study also found that the introduction of new lineages of the virus is followed by an increase in cases of dengue fever, with periodic peaks in incidence occurring every 7 to 10 years.

The researchers used a combination of genetic and epidemiological data to reach their conclusions. They analyzed 178 Brazilian genome sequences and used a spatial diffusion model to determine the factors that contribute to the spread of the virus. The study's findings suggest that air travel is a key factor in the spread of dengue virus within Brazil, and that the introduction of new lineages of the virus can lead to an increase in cases of dengue fever.
Researchers studied how the brain processes sensory information in weakly electric fish, focusing on three parallel sensory maps in the electrosensory lateral line (ELL) system. They investigated how differences in the organization of receptive fields (RFs) across these maps affect the correlations between the activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons. Receptive fields are areas of sensory space where stimuli cause a neural response. The researchers used a combination of mathematical modeling and in vivo electrophysiology to study the correlations between pyramidal neuron activities across the three ELL maps.

Contrary to their initial predictions, the researchers found that the average levels of correlation between pyramidal neuron activities were nearly identical across all three segments. To explain this result, they considered the effects of the antagonistic center-surround organization of RFs. They found that different combinations of RF center-surround balance gave rise to nearly identical correlations between pyramidal neuron activities in their model.

The researchers also found that the sign and magnitude of correlations were largely determined by the relative strength of positively and negatively correlated inputs. Pyramidal cells in all maps display an antagonistic center-surround RF organization, similar to that of retinal ganglion cells in the visual system. The study's findings suggest that RF center overlap alone does not determine correlations, which has important implications for understanding how RF structure influences correlated neural activity.
Researchers investigated how noise correlations between sensory neurons impact the population's ability to encode a stimulus. They considered a general setting for population coding, where neural tuning curves, variances, and other aspects were held fixed. The study found that noise correlations between pairs of neurons with opposite signs compared to their signal correlations can improve coding performance. This "sign rule" (SR) holds for three different metrics of coding performance and for arbitrary tuning curves and levels of heterogeneity. However, the SR is not a necessary condition for good coding, and a diverse set of correlation structures can also improve coding. In fact, the optimal correlation structures must lie on the boundaries of the possible set of noise correlations. The researchers provided a novel set of necessary and sufficient conditions for coding performance to be as good as if there were no noise present at all. These conditions are satisfied with high probability for large populations, and the set of such correlation matrices is very high-dimensional. The study's results provide general insights into the problem of population coding, shedding light on the role of noise correlations in neural population codes.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects the effectiveness of antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of infections. They found that P. aeruginosa can make S. aureus more or less susceptible to antibiotics, depending on the type of P. aeruginosa and the antibiotic being used. The researchers identified three ways in which P. aeruginosa can impact S. aureus: by producing a protein called LasA that helps vancomycin kill S. aureus, by making it easier for tobramycin to enter S. aureus cells, and by producing a molecule called HQNO that makes S. aureus resistant to multiple antibiotics. They also found that the production of these factors varies between different P. aeruginosa isolates, which can affect how well S. aureus responds to antibiotics. In a mouse model of infection, the researchers showed that the presence of LasA-producing P. aeruginosa can make vancomycin more effective against S. aureus. These findings suggest that the effectiveness of antibiotics against S. aureus can be influenced by interactions with other bacteria in the infection environment, and that considering these interactions may improve treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Dengue virus infection is associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of platelet clearance in dengue patients and found that excessive binding of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to platelets is a novel mechanism of platelet clearance. In two observational cohort studies in Indonesia, patients with dengue had higher plasma concentrations of VWF antigen and active VWF, and circulating platelets had bound more VWF to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated well with platelet count. Furthermore, sialic acid levels in dengue patients were significantly reduced, as assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) and Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL-II) to platelets. The researchers found that the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir reduced VWF-induced platelet desialylation. The study suggests that excessive binding of VWF to platelets in dengue results in neuraminidase-mediated platelet desialylation and platelet clearance. The findings indicate that oseltamivir might be a novel treatment option for severe thrombocytopenia in dengue infection.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism in the human genome that may play a role in the development of breast and ovarian cancers. This mechanism involves "bidirectional promoters," which are regions of DNA where two adjacent genes are transcribed in opposite directions. These promoters are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair, and the researchers found that they are highly enriched in genes implicated in somatic cancers, including breast and ovarian cancers.

Using a database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs), the researchers identified the most complete collection of human transcripts controlled by bidirectional promoters. They found that many of these promoters function as alternative promoters or regulate novel transcripts. The researchers also used microarray expression data from 79 human tissues to verify regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters.

The study found that subsets of these promoters contain similar combinations of transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor binding sites in genes such as ERBB2, FANCD2, and BRCA2. These findings suggest that bidirectional promoters may regulate co-expression patterns among groups of genes, including those involved in cancer. The researchers propose that misregulation of bidirectional promoters, particularly those containing common transcription factor binding sites, may contribute to cancer development.
Researchers studied the sex chromosomes of 37 fly species, representing 22 different families of Diptera. They found a surprising diversity of sex chromosome configurations, with over a dozen different arrangements. Most flies have XY sex chromosomes, but some have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others have a different chromosome as the sex chromosome, and some have up to three chromosomal elements incorporated into the sex chromosomes. Some species even have female heterogamety, with ZW sex chromosomes. The researchers also found that the small dot chromosome, which is a common feature of fly karyotypes, is used as the sex chromosome in many species, suggesting it may be the ancestral karyotype of higher Diptera. Transcriptome analysis revealed that dosage compensation, which balances gene expression between males and females, has evolved multiple times in flies. However, X chromosomes tend to have fewer genes with male-biased expression, possibly due to sex-specific selective pressures. The study provides a rich resource for studying sex chromosome biology in a comparative manner and highlights the unique evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa. The findings suggest that sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, rearranged, or replaced multiple times over the course of Diptera evolution, and that similar selective forces have shaped the evolution of sex chromosomes in different fly species.
Researchers in Hawaii tested blood samples from mothers who gave birth to babies with and without microcephaly between 2009 and 2012 to see if there was a link between Zika virus (ZIKV) infection and the birth defect. They found that one mother who delivered a baby with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody, and three mothers who delivered babies with microcephaly tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody. In contrast, none of the 12 mothers who delivered healthy babies tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody, and only one tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody. The study suggests that mothers who tested positive for ZIKV IgG antibody were more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly than those who were negative for the antibody, with an odds ratio of 11.0. Similarly, mothers who tested positive for ZIKV IgM antibody were also more likely to deliver babies with microcephaly, with an odds ratio of 6.8. These findings provide further evidence of a link between ZIKV infection and microcephaly, and suggest that ZIKV-positive cases and associated microcephaly may have occurred in the United States as early as 2009.
Researchers in Ghana investigated the source of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) infections, which cause Buruli ulcer (BU), in the Ashanti region. They used a genetic tool called Variable Number Tandem Repeat (VNTR) typing to compare MU strains found in humans with those in the environment. The team collected water and biofilm samples from 10 water bodies in four BU-endemic communities and compared them to MU strains from 14 confirmed BU patients.

The study found that MU was present in different types of water bodies, with higher levels in biofilm samples. Four MU genotypes, designated W, X, Y, and Z, were identified in both human and environmental samples, while other genotypes were only found in water bodies. Animal trapping revealed a mouse with a lesion characteristic of BU, which was confirmed to be an MU infection.

The researchers suggest that patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies, and that small mammals within endemic communities could be susceptible to MU infections. They propose that water bodies may act as vehicles for disseminating MU strains and other Mycolactone Producing Mycobacteria (MPM). The study's findings support the idea that patients are likely infected from the water bodies they frequently expose themselves to, and that these water bodies serve as reservoirs and vehicles for the dissemination of MU strains and other MPMs in endemic communities.
Researchers analyzed a comprehensive database of 27,723 distribution records for 971 alien bird species worldwide to understand the global distribution and drivers of alien bird species richness. They found that the locations of origin and introduction of alien birds, and their identities, were initially driven by European colonialism, mainly from Britain. However, recent introductions involve more species and countries, driven by increasing economic activity. The study demonstrates that alien bird species richness is highest at midlatitudes and is strongly influenced by anthropogenic effects, particularly the number of species introduced, known as "colonisation pressure." Environmental drivers also play a significant role, with native and alien species richness being strongly and consistently positively associated.

The researchers used a combination of abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify the determinants of alien species richness worldwide. They found that global patterns of alien species richness in birds are determined by both human and biotic factors. The study's global map of alien bird species distributions shows that regions with high alien species richness tend to be located in temperate regions at midlatitudes, where former British colonies, rapidly developing countries, and countries with high per capita GDP are located, and where colonisation pressure has been high. The results highlight the importance of colonisation pressure in understanding alien species richness and suggest that areas of high native species richness are not resistant to colonisation by alien species at the global scale, emphasizing the ongoing threats to global environments from species introductions.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a protein that plays a crucial role in the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, which are essential for cell growth and development. Research has shown that UBF is necessary for the formation of the active chromatin conformation of rRNA genes and the recruitment of the pre-initiation complex, which is required for transcription to begin. Deletion of UBF in mouse embryos revealed that it is essential for development beyond the morula stage. In cell cultures, conditional deletion of UBF showed that it is necessary for rRNA gene transcription and defines the active chromatin conformation of both gene and enhancer sequences. The loss of UBF prevents the formation of the pre-initiation complex and leads to the recruitment of histone modifications that are typically associated with inactive chromatin. However, the rRNA genes can maintain a potentially active state even in the absence of UBF. Unexpectedly, the loss of UBF does not suppress the transcription of other genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, suggesting that rRNA gene activity does not coordinate global gene expression for ribosome assembly. Furthermore, the deletion of UBF induces the formation of a large sub-nuclear structure called the nucleolar precursor body (NPB), which is similar to the NPB found in oocytes and early embryos.
Scientists have long understood that the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development and patterning of tissues in animals. However, a recent study has challenged the conventional understanding of how this pathway functions, suggesting that the secretion and movement of Wingless/Wnt ligands may not be essential for tissue patterning. To investigate this further, researchers focused on the adult Drosophila intestine, where Wingless/Wnt signaling gradients are critical for compartmentalization. They found that tethering Wingless/Wnt to the cell membrane, preventing its secretion and movement, disrupted various aspects of adult intestinal development, including target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell fate specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway. These findings suggest that the direct, long-range action of Wingless/Wnt is essential for tissue patterning in the adult intestine. This study provides new evidence supporting the requirement for the direct action of Wingless/Wnt in tissue patterning, with implications for our understanding of animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The researchers also suggest that their findings may be relevant to the mammalian intestine, which shares similarities with the Drosophila intestine in terms of compartmentalization and Wnt expression.
Researchers have identified a key role for the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in the development of invasive Group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. GAS is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and its ability to accumulate plasmin at the cell surface is crucial for invasive disease initiation. The study found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and subsequent invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of a source of host plasminogen activators, streptokinase (Ska) was required to facilitate cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of Ska, host activators were sufficient to promote cell surface plasmin acquisition by GAS strain 5448 during incubation with plasminogen or human plasma. The study also found that GAS can mediate a significant increase in the activation of zymogen pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess the contribution of uPA to invasive GAS disease, a previously undescribed transgenic mouse model of infection was employed. Both C57/black 6J and AlbPLG1 mice expressing the human plasminogen transgene were significantly more susceptible to invasive GAS disease than uPA−/− mice. The observed decrease in virulence in uPA−/− mice was found to correlate directly with a decrease in bacterial dissemination and reduced cell surface plasmin accumulation by GAS. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of GAS pathogenesis and research aimed at therapeutic targeting of plasminogen activation in invasive bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of type IV secretion system (T4SS) components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host cell interface. The cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) of H. pylori encodes components of the T4SS, which translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. CagL, CagI, and CagH are specialized components of the cag T4SS that bind the host receptor α5β1 integrin and are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PAI. These proteins are detectable on the bacterial surface and are required for CagA translocation into host cells and H. pylori-induced IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells.

Scanning electron microscopy analysis reveals that CagL, CagI, and CagH are involved in the formation of pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. Mutant strains lacking CagI or CagL fail to form pili, while a mutant strain lacking CagH exhibits a hyperpiliated phenotype with elongated and thickened pili. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif is present in CagH, CagI, and CagL, and deletion of these motifs results in abrogation of CagA translocation and IL-8 induction.

These results indicate that CagH, CagI, and CagL are components of a T4SS subassembly involved in pilus biogenesis, highlighting the important role played by unique constituents of the H. pylori cag T4SS in the development of gastric disease.
Scientists have been working to develop a vaccine against bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a chronic disease affecting cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis. To identify potential biomarkers of protection, researchers analyzed the global gene expression of vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle. The study found that 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated cattle that were protected against the disease compared to those that were not. The most significant pathway related to this dataset was cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, with interleukin-22 (IL-22) expression identified as a dominant predictor of protection, alongside interferon-gamma (INF-γ). The researchers confirmed the importance of IL-22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy in an independent set of samples.

The study built on previous research showing that BCG vaccination can induce protective immunity in some cattle, and that BCG remains the prototype vaccine against which to judge the efficacy of novel vaccine strategies. The researchers used a heterologous prime-boost protocol, where calves were first vaccinated with BCG and then boosted with an adenovirally vectored subunit vaccine. The results showed that both BCG and the prime-boost protocol provided significant protection against M. bovis challenge. The study's findings suggest that IL-22 could be a useful biomarker for predicting the success of vaccination against bTB, which could facilitate the development of more effective vaccines.
Researchers studied how microtubules are organized in cells, specifically in the intestinal cells of a type of worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. Microtubules are long, thread-like structures that play a crucial role in cell division and movement. The study focused on non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (ncMTOCs), which are found in most differentiated cells and help regulate microtubule organization and dynamics. The researchers used a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of two essential centrosomal microtubule nucleators, γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) and AIR-1/Aurora A, at the apical ncMTOC. They found that γ-TuRC and AIR-1 are required to recruit other γ-TuRC components to the centrosome, but not to the apical ncMTOC. Surprisingly, microtubules remained robustly organized at the apical ncMTOC even when γ-TuRC and AIR-1 were depleted. The study suggests that different microtubule organizing centers use discrete proteins for their function and that the apical ncMTOC is composed of distinct populations of γ-TuRC-dependent and -independent microtubules that compete for a limited pool of resources. The findings provide new insights into the regulation of microtubule organization and dynamics in cells.
Researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, which involves determining the origin of genetic variants inherited from each parent. They used a publicly available genome, NA12878, as a reference and evaluated the accuracy of each method using various metrics such as switch error rates, haplotype block lengths, and the proportion of fully phase-resolved genes. The study found that a hybrid approach combining population-based phasing, genome-wide sequencing data, and a large reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provides a fast and efficient way to produce highly accurate phase-resolved individual human genomes. This approach outperformed other methods, including laboratory-based assays, in terms of accuracy and cost-effectiveness. The study also found that including parental genotype data within a population-based phasing strategy can reduce phasing errors by up to tenfold. Additionally, the researchers identified DNA sequence signatures associated with genomic regions harboring phasing switch errors, which included regions of low polymorphism or single nucleotide variant (SNV) density. Overall, the study suggests that hybrid computational approaches to phasing a single genome are accurate and cost-effective, and can nearly match or surpass laboratory-based approaches.
Scientists have discovered a new way that certain bacteria, such as Salmonella, can secrete proteins without using energy from a molecule called ATP. This process, called type-III protein secretion, is crucial for the bacteria's survival and ability to cause disease. In the past, it was thought that ATP was necessary for this process to occur. However, researchers found that by increasing the energy available to the bacteria, they could secrete proteins without the need for ATP.

The study focused on the flagellum, a whip-like structure that Salmonella uses to move around. The flagellum is made up of proteins that are secreted through a type-III secretion system. The researchers found that by increasing the energy available to the bacteria, they could secrete these proteins without the need for a specific enzyme called an ATPase. This enzyme was thought to be necessary for the secretion process, but the study showed that it is not essential.

The researchers also found that increasing the energy available to the bacteria could bypass the need for another enzyme, called the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 virulence-associated type-III ATPase. This enzyme is important for the secretion of proteins that help the bacteria cause disease. The study's findings suggest that the role of ATPases in the type-III protein secretion process is to ensure efficient secretion when there is a limited supply of secretion substrates. The research has important implications for our understanding of how bacteria move and cause disease.
Scientists have long known that gene regulatory networks (GRNs) play a crucial role in controlling essential biological functions, such as cellular differentiation and cell cycle control. However, identifying the network topologies that can exhibit bistability, or the ability to switch between two distinct states, has been a challenge due to the vast number of possible GRNs. Researchers employed chemical reaction network theory to analyze over 40,000 simple GRNs consisting of two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins. They found that approximately 90% of these networks can exhibit bistability, including some that do not contain the typical features associated with bistable systems.

The study identified 36,771 bistable GRN architectures out of a total of 40,680 possible networks, including 11 minimal bistable networks that cannot be reduced to smaller bistable subnetworks. The researchers used advanced algorithms to analyze the networks and found that 36% of the networks are bistable for at least some sets of parameters, 9% have the capacity for multiple steady states, and 6.5% are monostable regardless of the parameters. The study suggests that the capacity for switch-like behavior in GRNs arises easily and is not easily lost through network evolution. The researchers also applied their approach to real biological systems, identifying several GRNs in yeast that are predicted to behave in a bistable fashion.
Researchers have identified a new genetic cause of orofacial clefting, a common birth defect, in humans and mice. Mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes the enzyme hyaluronidase 2, were found to be responsible for the condition. Hyaluronidase 2 breaks down hyaluronan, a critical component of the developing heart and palatal shelf matrix. The study found that mutations in the HYAL2 gene lead to reduced levels of the enzyme, resulting in craniofacial abnormalities, including submucosal cleft palate, in both humans and mice. Additionally, cor triatriatum sinister, a rare heart defect, and hearing loss were also observed in affected individuals and mice. The study highlights the importance of hyaluronidase enzymes in human and mouse development and reveals a previously unrecognized pathway involved in the pathogenesis of orofacial clefting, myopia, and cor triatriatum sinister. The findings suggest that a deficiency of the HA-degrading enzyme HYAL2 is a novel cause of syndromic orofacial clefting in humans and submucosal cleft palate in mice, and provide the first molecular explanation for cor triatriatum sinister in humans. The study's results have significant implications for understanding the genetic etiology of orofacial clefting and may lead to the development of new treatment therapies.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism for how auditory hair cells in the inner ear regenerate their tip links, which are essential for detecting sound. These tip links are made up of two proteins, protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) and cadherin 23 (CDH23), and were previously thought to have a static composition. However, the study found that tip links can have at least two different molecular compositions, containing either PCDH15/CDH23 or PCDH15/PCDH15. The researchers used a new imaging technique to visualize the tip links and found that during regeneration, shorter tip links with equal amounts of PCDH15 at both ends appear first, followed by the re-establishment of the mature PCDH15/CDH23 composition.

The study also found that these transient PCDH15/PCDH15 links can mediate mechanotransduction currents, but with abnormal calcium-dependent decay. The mature PCDH15/CDH23 tip link composition is re-established later, concomitant with complete recovery of adaptation. This discovery provides a molecular mechanism for the regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory hair cells. The findings could also help identify the elusive components of the mechanotransduction machinery. The researchers suggest that this two-step molecular remodeling process may underlie the formation of tip links in the developing hair bundle, their turnover in the mature bundle, and their regeneration after intense acoustical stimulation.
Researchers studied the metabolic changes in adult patients with severe dengue virus (DENV) infection, also known as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF), during the critical and recovery phases of the disease. They used a technique called mass spectrometry to analyze the levels of various metabolites, or small molecules, in the blood of patients with mild dengue fever (DF) and DHF. The study found 29 metabolites that were differentially expressed between DF and DHF patients at the critical phase of infection, which typically occurs 5-7 days after the onset of fever. These metabolites included bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Notably, bile acids were found to be significantly higher in DHF patients, suggesting liver injury, while uric acid, a key antioxidant, was lower in DHF patients, potentially leading to increased oxidative stress. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained altered in DHF patients, indicating a prolonged impact on the liver. The study identified altered metabolic pathways linked to DHF and provided insights into the mechanisms of disease progression. The findings may lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for dengue management.
Researchers have identified and characterized the guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes African trypanosomiasis. GMPR plays a crucial role in maintaining the balance of purine nucleotides within the cell. The study found that the GMPR enzyme in T. brucei is distinct from those found in its host animals, with a unique insertion of a cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain. This domain is not present in mammalian or bacterial GMPRs. The researchers also found that the T. brucei GMPR enzyme is activated by the presence of monovalent cations such as potassium and ammonium ions, whereas mammalian GMPRs are not affected by these ions. Additionally, the study showed that the purine nucleoside analog ribavirin inhibits the activity of T. brucei GMPR, but has little effect on mammalian GMPRs. These findings suggest that the mechanism of GMPR in T. brucei is distinct from that in its host organisms. The study also demonstrated that ribavirin can inhibit the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting its potential as a new therapeutic agent against African trypanosomiasis.
Researchers used computer simulations to study how two common drugs, benzocaine and phenytoin, interact with a type of protein called a voltage-gated sodium channel. These channels play a crucial role in controlling electrical excitability in cells, and blocking them can help treat conditions like epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia. To develop more targeted treatments, scientists need a better understanding of how existing drugs work.

The researchers used a recently discovered crystal structure of a bacterial sodium channel to simulate how benzocaine and phenytoin bind to the protein. They found that both drugs have two likely binding sites within the channel. One site is near the activation gate, where the channel opens and closes, and the other is at the entrance to a small opening in the channel called a fenestration.

The simulations suggest that benzocaine and phenytoin can enter the channel through the fenestration, which is a previously proposed "hydrophobic route" for neutral drugs. The researchers also identified specific amino acids that help guide the drugs into and through the fenestration. This study provides new insights into how sodium channel blockers work and could inform the development of more targeted and effective treatments for conditions like epilepsy and cardiac arrhythmia.
Researchers investigated the role of MyD88 signaling in the immune system's response to intestinal infection with the bacteria C. rodentium. MyD88 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the activation of the immune system in response to infections. The study used a novel mouse model to selectively reactivate MyD88 in specific cell types, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, T cells, and intestinal epithelial cells. The results showed that MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells was essential and sufficient to induce a full spectrum of host responses against C. rodentium infection. Specifically, MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells activated the early group 3 innate lymphoid cell response and the development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells. In contrast, restricting MyD88 signaling to other cell types, such as macrophages, T cells, or innate lymphoid cells, did not induce efficient intestinal immune responses. The study also found that MyD88 signaling in intestinal epithelial cells helped maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier and increased the expression of antimicrobial peptides and acute phase proteins. These findings suggest that MyD88 signaling in dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells plays a critical role in protecting against intestinal infection with C. rodentium.
Onchocerciasis, a disease caused by the parasite Onchocerciasis volvulus, is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin. To determine whether transmission is interrupted and mass treatment can stop, an immunodiagnostic test detects human IgG4 antibodies in the blood to the Onchocerciasis volvulus-specific antigen Ov16. Mathematical modeling was used to explore the relationship between post-MDA Ov16 antibody prevalence in children and the duration and coverage of MDA, microfilaria (mf) prevalence in the population, and the probability of onchocerciasis elimination. The ONCHOSIM model was extended to include new output on the Ov16 antibody serostatus of individuals. The study found that yearly repeated MDA leads to a strong reduction in the parasite acquisition rate in humans, which in turn reduces the seroconversion rate in newborns and young children. Both mf prevalence in the population aged 5 years and above and Ov16 antibody prevalence in children under 10 declined with increasing duration of MDA. The association between these indicators and the model-predicted probability of elimination was influenced by baseline endemicity levels, assumptions regarding the trigger of seroconversion, and diagnostic test characteristics. The study suggests that the endpoint for MDA will depend on baseline endemicity levels, which should be taken into account in guidelines for defining when to stop MDA.
Researchers studied how prions, misfolded proteins that can cause disease, adapt to their environment. They found that when prions were grown in the presence of a drug called swainsonine, some prions became resistant to the drug. This was not surprising for prions that were already resistant to the drug, but it was unexpected for prions that were sensitive to the drug. The researchers were able to select for prions that were not only resistant to the drug but also dependent on it, meaning they grew faster in the presence of the drug. These adapted prions could be passed on to other cells and continued to grow even when the drug was removed. The researchers found that the misfolded protein associated with the adapted prions had structural differences that allowed it to grow more efficiently in the presence of the drug. This suggests that prions can adapt to their environment through conformational changes, or changes in their shape, rather than through genetic mutations. The study provides new insights into how prions can evolve and adapt to their environment, which could have implications for the development of treatments for prion diseases.
Researchers analyzed a vast space of 1015 possible central carbon metabolisms to understand the potential for metabolic innovation. They used a method called flux balance analysis to predict the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 1024 potential metabolic phenotypes. The study found that viable metabolisms with any one phenotype make up a tiny fraction of the genotype space, but their absolute numbers are substantial, exceeding 10^9 for some phenotypes. The researchers also discovered that metabolisms with any one phenotype typically form a single network of genotypes that can be reached from each other through a series of single reaction changes. This means that metabolisms with novel phenotypes, viable on new carbon sources, can be reached through one or few genotypic changes. However, exceptions to this principle exist for metabolisms with complexity close to the minimum needed for viability. Increasing metabolic complexity enhances the potential for both evolutionary conservation and innovation. The study also found that the neighborhoods of different metabolisms viable on the same carbon source can contain different novel phenotypes, and the accessibility of these phenotypes may depend on the location of the metabolism in the genotype space.
Researchers studied the genetic variation and geographic distribution of the Triatoma dimidiata complex, a group of insects that can transmit the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. They analyzed the genetic diversity of the complex at different scales, from local to regional, and found that the lowest genetic diversity occurred in areas with high levels of human modification, such as deforestation and urbanization. These areas also had the highest prevalence of T. cruzi infection.

The researchers identified three main haplogroups of T. dimidiata: 1, 2, and 3. They found that haplogroups 1 and 3 had a higher prevalence of T. cruzi infection than expected, while haplogroup 2 had a lower prevalence. They also found that haplogroups 1 and 3 had different types of T. cruzi, known as discrete typing units (DTUs), than haplogroup 2.

The study suggests that the T. dimidiata complex originated in the region surrounding the Tehuantepec Isthmus in Mexico, and that the three haplogroups diverged from a common ancestor around 0.97-0.85 million years ago. The researchers also found that the effective population size of haplogroups 1 and 2 increased around 0.02-0.03 million years ago.

The study's findings have implications for the control of Chagas disease, as they suggest that different haplogroups of T. dimidiata may have different capacities to transmit the parasite. The researchers recommend that vector control programs take into account the genetic diversity of the T. dimidiata complex to develop effective strategies for controlling the spread of Chagas disease.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is a rodent-borne disease caused by two hantaviruses in China: Hantaan virus and Seoul virus. Environmental factors play a significant role in the risk of contracting hantavirus infections, primarily through their effects on rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. A 10-year field surveillance study in Chenzhou, a hantavirus hotspot in Hunan Province, analyzed the relationships between environmental factors, rodent species, and HFRS occurrence. The study included 709 cases of HFRS and found that different rodent species were associated with transmission risks in various land types. For example, Rattus norvegicus and R. flavipectus were linked to HFRS risk in grassland, while Mus musculus and R. flavipectus were associated with this risk in built-on land. The study also found that the rodent community composition was influenced by environmental variability, with cultivated land predicted to represent the highest risk for HFRS incidence. The results suggest that the spatial heterogeneity of HFRS disease may be influenced by rodent community composition, which is associated with local environmental conditions. Therefore, future work should focus on preventing HFRS in moist, warm environments. The study's findings provide scientific evidence for developing effective HFRS prevention and control strategies.
Researchers have identified a new mutation in the HRAS gene that causes a milder form of Costello syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The mutation, c.35_36GC>TG, results in exon 2 skipping in the HRAS gene, leading to a less severe phenotype compared to other mutations in the same gene. The study found that this mutation disrupts the function of a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (ESE) and creates an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS), making exon 2 inclusion dependent on the binding of splicing stimulatory proteins.

The researchers also discovered that the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion is crucial in determining the phenotype of Costello syndrome and cancer. They found that mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the HRAS gene impact exon 2 inclusion differently, resulting in varying levels of splicing efficiency. This suggests that the phenotype of Costello syndrome and cancer is not only determined by the transforming potential of mutant HRAS proteins, but also by the efficiency of exon 2 inclusion.

The study also identified a potential new approach for developing anti-cancer therapies. A splice-switching oligonucleotide (SSO) that blocks access to the critical ESE causes exon 2 skipping and halts the proliferation of cancer cells. This finding could lead to the development of new treatments for cancer based on SSO-mediated HRAS exon 2 skipping.
Researchers have found that a specific type of RNA modification called N6-methyladenosine (m6A) plays a crucial role in the development of the cerebellum, a part of the brain that controls movement and balance. This modification is added to messenger RNA (mRNA) by an enzyme called methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3). When METTL3 is inactivated in mice, the cerebellum fails to develop properly, leading to a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia. This is caused by the premature death of a type of cell called cerebellar granule cells, which are essential for the development of the cerebellum.

The study found that the loss of m6A caused by METTL3 inactivation leads to changes in the way genes are expressed and spliced, resulting in the death of cerebellar granule cells. This is because m6A helps regulate the stability and splicing of mRNAs, and its loss leads to the accumulation of abnormal mRNAs that promote cell death. The researchers also found that the loss of m6A affects the development of other cells in the cerebellum, including Purkinje cells and Bergmann glia.

These findings suggest that METTL3 and m6A play a critical role in regulating the development of the cerebellum, and that their dysregulation can lead to severe developmental defects. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying cerebellar development and may have implications for understanding neurological disorders that affect the cerebellum.
Researchers studied how proteins called transcription factors regulate gene expression in human and mouse embryonic stem cells. These cells have the ability to develop into any cell type in the body. The transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG are essential for maintaining this ability. The study found that when these factors bind together to specific DNA sequences, called enhancers, it leads to increased expression of nearby genes. This combinatorial binding is associated with the presence of a co-activator called Mediator and a specific histone modification called H3K27ac. The researchers observed that the same enhancers bound by OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in human embryonic stem cells are often active during early embryonic development in both humans and mice. However, individual binding events for these transcription factors are not highly conserved between species. In contrast, combinatorial binding events at enhancers active in early development are conserved in about 53-63% of cases. This suggests that the combination of OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG binding is crucial for transcription in embryonic stem cells and plays a significant role in embryonic development. The study also found that regulatory elements bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues throughout early development are under stronger evolutionary constraints, implying that these "gene regulatory hotspots" are conserved across species.
Researchers have studied the AML1/ETO oncogenic transcription factor, which is formed by a chromosomal translocation that occurs in 10-15% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases. This fusion protein disrupts the normal function of its wild-type counterpart, AML1, by targeting its binding sites on DNA. However, AML1/ETO also interacts with other transcription factors, including E-proteins like HEB, which suggests that its regulation of gene expression is more complex than initially thought.

Using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling, the researchers found that AML1/ETO co-localizes with AML1 and HEB on many of its regulated targets. This suggests that the fusion protein follows the binding pattern of the wild-type AML1 protein, but does not primarily function by displacing it. The study also found that the DNA binding profile of HEB is altered when AML1/ETO is expressed, and that the level of HEB protein is increased in cells expressing the fusion protein.

The researchers propose that the functional interaction between AML1/ETO, AML1, and HEB plays a major role in the transcriptional regulation determined by the fusion protein. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms by which AML1/ETO regulates gene expression and contributes to the development of AML. The findings also suggest that the interaction between AML1/ETO and HEB may be a key factor in the progression of the disease.
Researchers investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase 2 (HAT2) in the parasite Leishmania donovani. They found that HAT2 is essential for the parasite's growth and survival, and its depletion leads to cell cycle defects and poor survival in host cells. HAT2 acetylates histone H4 at lysine 10 (H4K10), and this modification is crucial for the expression of specific genes involved in the cell cycle, including cyclins CYC4 and CYC9. The researchers discovered that CYC4 and CYC9 have their own promoters, which are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and are sensitive to H4K10 acetylation levels. In HAT2-depleted cells, the expression of CYC4 and CYC9 is downregulated, leading to cell cycle defects. The study reveals a two-tiered system of gene regulation in Leishmania donovani, where transcription of polycistronic units initiates at divergent strand switch regions (dSSRs) in a constitutive manner, and a subset of genes, including CYC4 and CYC9, have their own promoters that are activated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. This second tier of regulation is more sensitive to H4K10 acetylation levels, highlighting the importance of HAT2 and H4K10 acetylation in regulating gene expression in Leishmania donovani. The study provides new insights into the gene regulation mechanisms in this parasite and has implications for understanding the biology of Leishmania donovani.
Researchers investigated how people infer others' intentions in social interactions using a computational modeling approach. In an economic game, 16 pairs of volunteers played a probabilistic reinforcement learning task, where one player received information about a binary lottery from a visual pie chart and the other player, the adviser, provided additional recommendations. The adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information varied over time. Using a meta-Bayesian modeling framework, the researchers found that the players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning, where they inferred the volatility of the adviser's intentions to optimize their predictions about the validity of the advice. The players' estimates of volatility also affected their trial-by-trial variability in decisions, with participants relying more on their estimates of advice accuracy when they believed the adviser's intentions were stable. The model predicted the players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, explicit ratings of the advisers' helpfulness, and the advisers' self-reports on their chosen strategy. The study suggests that humans employ hierarchical generative models to infer changing intentions, use volatility estimates to inform decision-making, and integrate estimates of advice accuracy with non-social sources of information. The Bayesian framework can quantify individual differences in these mechanisms and may be useful in future clinical studies of maladaptive social cognition. Players who interacted with advisers whose intentions were changing to maximize their own winnings showed more pronounced values, indicating that the two hierarchical learning levels were more strongly coupled in this subset of participants.
Scrub typhus, a disease caused by the bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, has traditionally been considered a rural disease in Asia. However, a recent study has identified indigenous urban cases of scrub typhus in Seoul, South Korea, the country's largest metropolitan city. The study analyzed national notifiable disease data from 2010 to 2013 and found 88 cases of urban scrub typhus in Seoul. The possible sites of infection were mountainous areas, city parks, the vicinity of one's own residence, and riversides. Chigger mites, the vectors that transmit the disease, were collected in the city and identified as Helenicula miyagawai and Leptotrombidium scutellare. DNA extracted from H. miyagawai mites yielded the O. tsutsugamushi Boryong strain.

The study found that patients with urban scrub typhus had mild clinical features, with low APACHE II scores and low complication rates. The chigger mite H. miyagawai was found to be infected with O. tsutsugamushi within the city. The study suggests that urban scrub typhus needs to be considered as one of the differential febrile diseases in endemic areas and a target for prevention. Further research is needed to characterize the overall status of scrub typhus in Seoul and to determine the role of H. miyagawai mites in human infection. The study's findings highlight the potential for scrub typhus to spread into urban areas under high incidence pressure from surrounding areas.
Researchers studied the role of HENN-1, a protein in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, in regulating two types of small RNA molecules called 26G and 21U RNAs. These RNAs are involved in a process called RNA interference (RNAi), which helps control gene activity. The study found that HENN-1 has different effects on the stability of 26G and 21U RNAs. In the germline, the reproductive cells of the worm, the stability of 21U RNAs was only mildly affected by the loss of HENN-1. In contrast, the stability of 26G RNAs was significantly reduced without HENN-1. The researchers also found that a specific type of 26G RNA, bound to a protein called ERGO-1, was modified by HENN-1, while another type of 26G RNA, bound to ALG-3/ALG-4, was not. This suggests that HENN-1 plays a specific role in stabilizing certain types of 26G RNAs. The study also found that the loss of HENN-1 had mild effects on gene expression in the germline, with some genes being down-regulated. The researchers propose that these effects are indirect, resulting from the reduced levels of 26G RNAs. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of HENN-1 in regulating RNAi pathways in C. elegans.
Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery in the field of genomics and glycomics by identifying a key regulator of protein fucosylation in the human body. Fucosylation is the process by which a sugar molecule called fucose is attached to proteins, and it plays a crucial role in various physiological and pathological processes. Using a combination of genome-wide association studies and high-throughput glycomics analysis, scientists found that a protein called Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) regulates the levels of fucosylated glycans in human plasma. HNF1α is a transcription factor that controls the expression of genes involved in fucose biosynthesis and fucosyltransferase genes, which are responsible for adding fucose to proteins.

The study revealed that HNF1α is a master regulator of multiple stages in the fucosylation process, including the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose, the substrate used by fucosyltransferases to attach fucose to proteins. The researchers also found that HNF1α is necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of fucosyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes in hepatic cells. This discovery has significant implications for our understanding of various diseases, including cancer, coronary heart disease, and metabolic and inflammatory disorders, which have been linked to altered fucosylation patterns. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases and highlights the importance of HNF1α as a key regulator of protein fucosylation.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Centromere Protein C (CENPC) plays a crucial role in the formation of kinetochores, the structures that attach chromosomes to the cytoskeleton during cell division. However, the DNA sequence of centromeres, the regions where kinetochores form, has little to do with this process. Instead, RNA molecules transcribed from centromeres remain bound to the kinetochore region and are thought to be part of an epigenetic marking system.

A study on maize CENPC found that a specific region of the protein is responsible for binding to DNA, and that this binding is greatly enhanced by the presence of single-stranded RNA. The researchers showed that long, single-stranded nucleic acids promote the binding of CENPC to DNA, and that the types of RNAs that stabilize DNA binding match the RNAs present on kinetochores in living cells.

The study suggests that centromeric RNA helps to recruit CENPC to the inner kinetochore by altering its DNA binding characteristics. This process is thought to be an essential step in the formation of kinetochores and the proper segregation of chromosomes during cell division. The researchers propose that CENPC is first recruited to kinetochores by protein-protein contacts and then converted to a functional DNA binding protein by centromeric RNA.

The findings of this study support the idea that RNA plays a crucial role in the epigenetic marking of centromeres and the recruitment of kinetochore proteins. This process is conserved across different species, including humans, and is essential for proper chromosome segregation during cell division.
Researchers have identified genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood body mass index (BMI). The placenta, a critical organ for fetal development and postnatal health, plays a key role in this process. By examining the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), the study found that genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood BMI are significantly enriched in the placenta. This suggests that placental transcription in the womb may influence postnatal body size.

The study discovered hundreds of transcripts controlled by genetic variants that influence birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood BMI. The placenta was found to be a highly relevant tissue for determining not only birth weight but also body weight in childhood. The researchers identified eight, six, and one transcripts that colocalized with birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood BMI risk loci, respectively.

Comparing placental eQTLs to eQTLs from other tissues, such as adipose and liver, revealed that placental eQTLs are enriched to a greater extent for childhood obesity and childhood BMI GWAS hits. The study also found that the placenta is a transcriptionally active tissue, with over 3,000 cis- and trans-eQTLs identified at a false discovery rate of 10%. These findings suggest that the placenta plays a crucial role in determining postnatal body size and may hold new possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity.
Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic skin condition that occurs in people who have previously been treated for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a more severe form of the disease. PKDL is not life-threatening, but it is a significant public health concern because it can contribute to the transmission of leishmaniasis in endemic areas. In Malda district, West Bengal, India, researchers conducted a study to determine the prevalence of PKDL and compared three diagnostic methods: PCR (polymerase chain reaction), slit skin smear, and rK-39 rapid diagnostic kit.

The study found that 26 cases of PKDL were detected, with a prevalence rate of 27.5% among antileishmanial antibody-positive cases. PCR was the most sensitive diagnostic method, with a sensitivity rate of 88.46%. However, skin lesions persisted in most cases after treatment, and two cases showed reappearance of lesions after 1.5 years of treatment. The study suggests that a significant number of PKDL patients would remain undiagnosed without active mass surveys, highlighting the need for such surveys in other endemic areas to achieve the goal of eliminating kala-azar.

The researchers also found that PCR-based diagnosis is a useful tool for confirming PKDL, but a well-designed study with a larger sample size is needed to determine whether PKDL patients are free from parasites after treatment and to identify which patients require longer treatment periods. The study's findings emphasize the importance of developing effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for PKDL to control the transmission of leishmaniasis in endemic areas.
Researchers have discovered how a type of bacteria called Streptococcus pneumoniae develops the ability to take up new genetic material from its environment. This process, called competence, is crucial for the bacteria's survival and ability to adapt to changing conditions. The study found that competence development in S. pneumoniae is a two-step process. First, a small group of cells within the population becomes competent and starts producing a signaling molecule called CSP. This molecule then triggers the rest of the population to become competent through cell-to-cell contact.

The researchers observed this process in four different strains of S. pneumoniae and found that the CSP molecule is retained on the surface of competent cells, allowing it to be transmitted to other cells through contact. This process is essential for the bacteria's ability to share genetic material and adapt to its environment. The study suggests that this process is a key factor in the bacteria's ability to evade vaccines, antibiotics, and the host immune system.

The researchers also found that the timing of competence development is linked to the bacteria's growth rate, rather than the density of the population. They propose that a small group of cells within the population becomes competent in response to stress, and then triggers the rest of the population to become competent through cell-to-cell contact. This process allows S. pneumoniae to rapidly adapt to changing conditions and maintain its ability to take up new genetic material.
Researchers have discovered that the human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) L2 protein plays a crucial role in ensuring the viral genome (vDNA) reaches the nucleus, where HPV replication occurs. The L2 protein acts as a chaperone, guiding the vDNA from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus. To reach the nucleus, the L2/vDNA complex must cross limiting intracellular membranes, a process that has been poorly understood. Using a novel system based on the enzyme BirA and its substrate, researchers found that L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on the onset of mitosis. In synchronized cells, L2 translocation coincides with mitotic entry and is blocked by cell cycle arrest. Microscopy of EdU-labeled vDNA revealed a rapid shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis, with vDNA egressing from the TGN to a pericentriolar location and associating with condensed chromosomes. By metaphase and anaphase, vDNA is bound to mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into both daughter nuclei. Mutations in a newly defined chromatin-binding region of L2 blocked translocation, suggesting that L2 binds to chromatin during prometaphase to facilitate translocation. This study represents the first time a virus has been shown to couple membrane penetration to cellular mitosis, explaining in part the tropism of HPV for mitotic basal keratinocytes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to measure the relative transmissibility, or "transmission fitness," of one strain of a pathogen compared to another. This framework is applied to data from "competitive mixtures" experiments, where animals are co-infected with two strains of a pathogen. By observing the mixture in each animal over time and multiple generations of transmission, the researchers can estimate the relative transmissibility of the two strains. The method is demonstrated using data from influenza experiments in ferrets.

The relative transmissibility of one strain of influenza compared to another is crucial in various contexts, including seasonal and pandemic interactions, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant strains due to the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs). The mathematical framework introduced here provides an estimate for the size of the transmitted inoculum, which is essential for determining the likely time-course and epidemiology of an influenza outbreak or the potential impact of an intervention measure such as NAI distribution.

The researchers suggest that the competitive mixtures animal model paradigm is applicable in all three contexts, making the mathematical framework presented here widely applicable in influenza research. They also indicate potential improvements in competitive-mixtures experimental design, including the use of multiple donor ferrets and deriving an estimate for the number of successfully infecting units transferred from the donor to recipient. The method is also applicable to pathogens other than influenza, as long as the within-host dynamics of the two strains are considered.
Scientists have long known that light and a plant hormone called abscisic acid (ABA) play crucial roles in regulating plant growth and development. However, how plants integrate these external and internal signals to adapt to their environment remains poorly understood. Researchers have discovered that a protein called BBX21, which helps regulate seedling growth in response to light, also plays a role in ABA signaling. The study found that BBX21 acts upstream of several genes involved in ABA control of seed germination, including ABI5. ABI5 is a key regulator of seed germination and seedling development, and BBX21 negatively regulates its expression by interfering with the binding of another protein, HY5, to the ABI5 promoter. HY5 is a transcription factor that activates ABI5 expression and is involved in promoting seedling photomorphogenesis. The study suggests that BBX21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI5 on the ABI5 promoter to integrate light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. This research provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the cross-talk between light and ABA, and highlights the importance of understanding how plants integrate external and internal signals to adapt to their environment. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of plant development and stress responses, and may lead to the development of new strategies for improving crop yields and stress tolerance.
Researchers have studied the Mediator complex in Candida albicans, a pathogenic fungus, to understand its role in regulating gene expression. The Mediator complex is a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II that is conserved across eukaryotes. The study focused on three subunits of the Mediator complex: Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13. The results show that the C. albicans Mediator shares some functions with model yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, such as responding to certain stresses and regulating genes involved in morphogenesis. However, the C. albicans Mediator also has unique roles in regulating genes associated with virulence, including those involved in morphogenesis and adhesion. The study found that Med31, Med20, and Srb9/Med13 contribute to key virulence attributes of C. albicans, such as filamentation and biofilm formation. Additionally, Med31 affects the virulence of C. albicans in a worm infection model. The researchers also discovered that the roles of Med31 and Srb9/Med13 in regulating adhesion genes differ between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, suggesting that the Mediator complex regulates adhesion in a distinct manner between these two fungal species. Overall, the study provides new insights into the functions of the Mediator complex in C. albicans and its role in shaping species-specific gene expression.
Scientists have long known that bacteria in biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than those growing on their own, known as planktonic bacteria. To better understand why this is the case, researchers studied the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in both biofilm and planktonic states, with and without the antibiotic tobramycin. They used a technique called transposon mutagenesis to identify which genes contribute to antibiotic tolerance in each state.

The study found that many genes play a role in antibiotic tolerance, but their importance varies depending on whether the bacteria are in a biofilm or growing planktonically. In fact, most genes that give bacteria a strong advantage in the biofilm state have only a weak or moderate advantage in the planktonic state. This suggests that the biofilm state itself plays a significant role in antibiotic tolerance.

The researchers also found that some genes contribute to antibiotic tolerance in one state but not the other. For example, genes involved in quorum sensing, a process by which bacteria communicate with each other, were more important in the planktonic state. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic tolerance in biofilms and planktonic bacteria, and could lead to the development of new treatments for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FAMoS (Flexible and dynamic Algorithm for Model Selection) to analyze complex biological systems. These systems are difficult to understand due to many interacting components and limited information about their dynamics. FAMoS helps identify relevant factors and processes by evaluating the performance of multiple models against experimental data. Unlike other algorithms, FAMoS can search large model spaces in a dynamic way, preventing it from getting stuck in local minima. It uses both local and non-local search methods to account for structurally similar processes. The algorithm was tested on simulated data and shown to be flexible in handling different model structures. It was also applied to experimental data on T cell proliferation dynamics, revealing changes in cell proliferation potential in 3D tissue-like cultures compared to suspension cultures. FAMoS can be used for various biological problems and represents a useful tool for evaluating complex model spaces. The algorithm's flexibility in handling different model structures makes it applicable to a wide range of research questions. Its ability to efficiently search large model spaces provides a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics, which is essential for understanding complex biological systems.
Researchers in Bolivia conducted a 12-month study to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole (BNZ) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive school-age children who received BNZ treatment for 60 days. Blood samples were taken before, during, and after treatment, and analyzed for parasite levels and cytokine levels, including IL-17A.

The results showed that 73 children completed the treatment, with three experiencing side effects. After 12 months, 11% of the children still had detectable parasite levels, 42% had ambiguous results, and 47% were considered cured. The study found that IL-17A levels were significantly higher in seropositive children before treatment compared to seronegative children and decreased to normal levels after treatment. IL-17A levels were also positively correlated with parasite counts detected by quantitative real-time PCR.

The study suggests that IL-17A may be a useful biomarker for detecting persistent infection and chronic inflammation in Chagas disease. The results also indicate that factors other than the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of BNZ may affect treatment efficacy, particularly in children who did not respond to treatment. The study highlights the need for further research to understand the role of host and parasite factors in treatment failure. The findings have implications for the development of more effective treatment strategies for Chagas disease, which affects millions of people worldwide.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism for phase variation in the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis, the primary cause of bacterial meningitis. This mechanism involves the Correia element, a small transposon that makes up almost 2% of the meningococcal genome. The Correia element has eight subtypes, each with distinct ends that can encode strong promoters. These promoters can drive the transcription of adjacent genes or small non-coding RNAs. The researchers found that the Correia elements can switch between subtypes through a process called recombinational class switching, which allows a new allele to spread through the population by natural transformation. This process may contribute to the development or persistence of hypervirulent lineages that cause most global meningococcal disease. The study also found that the Correia elements are not simply degenerate remnants of transposition events, but rather were created relatively recently in a burst of transposition. The researchers have defined the strength of the promoters encoded by the eight subtypes of Correia ends, providing a resource to predict the transcriptional effects of a particular subtype at a given locus. This discovery highlights the potential for widespread effects within the meningococcal population due to the strain-to-strain variability of the Correia elements and the large number of strong promoters they encode.
Researchers have identified two proteins, ChLae1 and ChVel1, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus that play a crucial role in regulating the production of a toxin called T-toxin. T-toxin is a key factor in the pathogen's ability to cause disease in maize, particularly in plants with Texas male sterile cytoplasm. The study found that ChLae1 and ChVel1 positively regulate T-toxin production, particularly in the dark, and are required for the pathogen's virulence and ability to cause disease. The researchers also discovered that ChLae1 and ChVel1 are involved in regulating the pathogen's response to oxidative stress and its development, including its ability to produce melanin and undergo sexual reproduction. In contrast, overexpression of ChLae1 and ChVel1 led to increased T-toxin production and virulence. The study suggests that ChLae1 and ChVel1 act as positive regulators of T-toxin production by controlling the expression of genes involved in its biosynthesis. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogen's ability to cause disease in maize and highlight the importance of ChLae1 and ChVel1 in regulating the pathogen's virulence and development.
Scientists have been trying to understand how a type of ion channel in bacteria, called Nav channels, allows certain ions to pass through while blocking others. These channels are similar to those found in human cells, but with some key differences. Researchers used a combination of computer simulations and mathematical models to study how ions move through the channels. They found that potassium ions (K+) can block the entrance to the channel, preventing them from passing through, but only when forces are applied in one direction. In contrast, sodium ions (Na+) can pass through the channel easily in both directions. The researchers used a technique called non-equilibrium simulation to study how ions move through the channel, which provided new insights into the mechanism of selective ion permeation. They found that the block state of K+ ions occurs in an unstable local minimum of the free-energy landscape, which can be "locked" in place by applied forces. The simulations also predicted that the energy required to break the K+ block is equivalent to the large applied potentials needed to induce inward currents of K+ ions in bacterial Nav channels. These findings suggest that the mechanism of ion selectivity in bacterial Nav channels is different from what was previously thought, and is consistent with electrophysiological measurements of these channels.
Researchers studied how the rabies virus spreads within the brains of dogs with the furious and paralytic forms of the disease. They found that in the furious form, the virus colonized the cerebral hemispheres more quickly, as measured by the presence of viral antigen and RNA in neuronal cell bodies. In contrast, the paralytic form showed a slower spread of the virus. The study used image analysis to quantify the amount of rabies viral antigen in cell processes, which are the extensions of neurons that allow them to communicate with each other. The results showed that the amount of antigen in cell processes decreased in a rostral (toward the front of the brain) direction, similar to the pattern seen in neuronal cell bodies. However, there was a delay in the involvement of cell processes compared to cell bodies, suggesting that the virus replicates in the cell body region before spreading to the processes. The study found that dogs with the furious form had more antigen in their cell processes than those with the paralytic form, even when comparing similar amounts of antigen in cell bodies and similar percentages of involved neurons. This suggests that the intracellular transport of the virus may be slower in the paralytic form, leading to slower viral propagation. The researchers propose that host-specific differences in intracellular virus transport, possibly mediated by cytokines, may be responsible for this difference.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein CTCF in the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly. CTCF is known to play a crucial role in vertebrates as an enhancer-blocking factor, but its function in Drosophila was not well understood. The team used a technique called chromatin immunopurification coupled with genomic microarray analysis to identify CTCF binding sites in various regions of the Drosophila genome, including the Bithorax complex (BX-C). They found that CTCF binds to specific sites in the BX-C, including the known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8. These findings suggest that CTCF is directly associated with all known or predicted insulators in the BX-C, indicating a common CTCF-dependent mechanism for their functioning. The researchers also identified three additional presumptive insulator elements, "Fab-2," "Fab-3," and "Fab-4," which correlate with the boundaries of regulatory domains. The study provides new insights into the role of CTCF in the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila and suggests that CTCF-dependent mechanisms may be conserved across different species. The findings have implications for our understanding of the organization and regulation of the BX-C, a complex genetic region involved in the development of Drosophila.
Scientists have long understood that enzymes, which speed up chemical reactions in the body, recognize and bind to their substrates through a process called molecular recognition. However, the details of this process have been difficult to study due to its dynamic nature. A team of researchers has made significant progress in understanding this process by studying a specific enzyme called peptide deformylase and its interaction with a slow-binding inhibitor called actinonin. They used a combination of techniques, including crystallography, biophysics, and computational modeling, to capture the step-by-step process of how actinonin binds to peptide deformylase.

The researchers found that the binding of actinonin triggers a series of conformational changes in the enzyme, which ultimately leads to the formation of a "key-lock" binding state. This process involves the reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket in the enzyme and the "zipping up" of the active site through additional binding interactions. The researchers were able to capture several intermediate states in this process, allowing them to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the final binding state.

The study provides new insights into the mechanism of slow-binding inhibitors, which are often used as therapeutics due to their unique properties, including selective potency and long-lasting effects. The findings of this study can be applied to the broader area of receptor-ligand interactions and may have implications for the design of new therapeutics.
Researchers investigated how sensory information is transmitted from the thalamus to the cerebral cortex. They used a combination of theoretical and experimental approaches to create a simulated retino-thalamo-cortical pathway in thalamic slices. The study found that the efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key factors: the number of thalamocortical cells involved, the statistics of corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and the level of correlation between converging thalamic relay cells. Counterintuitively, the study found that the transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become desynchronized by cortical feedback. The researchers propose that active decorrelation of background synaptic activity in the thalamic layer provides a powerful optimization mechanism controlling the efficiency of retinocortical signal transfer. They also propose that a stochastic facilitation process emerging at the whole thalamic population level enhances global sensory information transfer in the presence of decorrelated corticogeniculate feedback bombardment. This process may be the basis for attentional modulation of sensory signals at the thalamic level.
Researchers have identified a protein called NMAD-1 that plays a crucial role in DNA replication and repair during meiosis in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Meiosis is the process by which sex cells, or gametes, are produced. NMAD-1 is a demethylase, a type of enzyme that removes methyl groups from DNA. The study found that worms lacking NMAD-1 have reduced fertility, produce fewer embryos, and have an increased number of males due to errors in chromosomal segregation. This is because NMAD-1 is necessary for proper DNA replication and repair during meiosis.

The researchers observed that NMAD-1 binds to proteins involved in DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2, and co-localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin. This suggests that NMAD-1 acts on chromatin to regulate DNA replication and repair during meiosis. The study also found that the majority of TOP-2 binding to chromatin depends on NMAD-1, indicating that NMAD-1 is essential for TOP-2's function.

Further analysis revealed that NMAD-1 mutants have disorganized nuclear staging, mislocalized cohesin complex, and improperly condensed, fused, or lost chromosomes during meiosis. RNA sequencing of the NMAD-1 germline showed reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage response genes, delayed DNA replication, impaired DNA repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. These findings suggest that NMAD-1's demethylation activity at DNA is central to its role in meiosis.
Researchers have identified a new protein called adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (APMAP) that plays a crucial role in the early stages of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. HCMV is a common virus that can cause serious health problems in newborns and people with weakened immune systems. The virus has a complex structure and can infect a wide range of human cells, but the exact mechanism of infection is still not fully understood.

The study found that APMAP is necessary for HCMV infection in both epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and that knocking down APMAP expression significantly reduced the virus's ability to infect these cells. Conversely, over-expressing APMAP in cells that are normally resistant to HCMV infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T3 cells, made them more susceptible to the virus.

The researchers also found that APMAP helps the virus to enter cells by interacting with a specific protein complex on the surface of the virus, called gH/gL. This interaction allows the virus to enter the cell and begin to replicate. The study suggests that APMAP is an important player in the complex process of HCMV infection, and that it may be a potential target for developing new treatments for HCMV-related diseases.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how hematopoietic progenitor cells make decisions about which lineage to commit to. Traditionally, models of cell differentiation have focused on intrinsic factors, such as the expression of transcription factors within the cell. However, this new model incorporates both intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including the role of cytokines, which are signaling molecules that can influence cell behavior.

The model suggests that cytokine-mediated positive feedback can induce a "switch-like" response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. This means that cytokines can strongly bias lineage commitment by regulating inherently noisy cell-fate decisions. The model also shows that the kinetics of differentiation to a mature cell state can depend on the starting progenitor state and the route of commitment chosen.

The study supports both the instructive and stochastic theories of commitment, which have been debated in the field. The instructive theory suggests that cell-fate decisions are regulated by extrinsic growth factor cues, while the stochastic theory proposes that differential expression of lineage-specific transcription factors due to intrinsic noise dictates the commitment decision. The model provides a computational framework that can integrate both classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoiesis, which have been observed experimentally.
Researchers have studied the ultrastructure of the Bunyamwera virus, a member of the Orthobunyavirus genus, using electron cryo-tomography. This virus is part of a growing group of emerging viruses that pose a threat to human and animal health. The study aimed to understand the virus's structure, which is crucial for understanding how it assembles and enters host cells. The researchers found that Bunyamwera virions have a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes, with each spike protruding 18 nanometers from the viral membrane. When introduced to an acidic environment, the spikes become disordered. Using sub-tomogram averaging, the researchers created a three-dimensional model of the trimeric pre-fusion glycoprotein spike to a resolution of 3 nanometers. The glycoprotein spike consists mainly of the putative class-II fusion glycoprotein and has a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts between neighboring spikes occur at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike contacts at membrane-distal regions. This trimeric assembly deviates from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a greater than anticipated repertoire of viral fusion glycoprotein oligomerization. The study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformational change that occurs during orthobunyaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of this group of emerging pathogens. The researchers also found that the sequences of the Bunyamwera virus glycoproteins are conserved with those of more pathogenic relatives, indicating a high degree of structural similarity between viruses.
Researchers have identified a gene called ABCC5 as a risk factor for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a leading cause of blindness in Asia. The study involved a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 5,308 individuals of Asian descent, which found a significant association between a variant of the ABCC5 gene and a shallower anterior chamber depth (ACD). A shallower ACD is a known risk factor for PACG, as it can lead to a more crowded anterior segment and increase the risk of angle closure.

The study found that individuals with the variant of the ABCC5 gene had a 13% increased risk of developing PACG compared to those without the variant. This association was strengthened when the analysis was limited to individuals with open angles, suggesting that the ABCC5 gene may play a role in the development of PACG. The researchers also found that the ABCC5 gene is expressed in tissues relevant to PACG, such as the iris, ciliary body, and lens.

The study provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying PACG, a major cause of blindness in Asia. The findings suggest that genetic variants influencing ACD may contribute to the development of PACG. Further research is needed to identify novel potentially functional polymorphisms related to PACG pathogenesis.
Researchers have identified the first examples of developmental enhancers that are conserved between deuterostomes and protostomes, two groups of animals that were previously thought to have distinct developmental toolkits. These enhancers, called bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bicores), show conservation of sequence and gene synteny, and are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways. In vertebrates, Bicores drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the central nervous system. The discovery of Bicores suggests that there may be a common developmental logic encoded in the genome that is shared between deuterostomes and protostomes. However, the small number of identified Bicores implies that there may be extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between the two clades. Further research is needed to determine the true extent of cis-regulatory sequence and function conservation underlying animal development. As more genomes are sequenced and our understanding of cis-regulatory logic improves, it is likely that more Bicores will be discovered. The identification of Bicores offers a new avenue for exploring how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how it evolves.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the impact of vaccination on the diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses within individual hosts. They analyzed data from a clinical trial involving 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over three seasons, using next-generation sequencing to examine the genetic diversity of the virus within each host. The study found that vaccination had a minimal impact on the diversity of the virus within hosts, with most intrahost single nucleotide variants being rare and few found in more than one individual. The researchers also found that the level of diversity did not significantly vary with the day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. This suggests that vaccine-induced immunity may not be a major contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. The study's findings are in contrast to previous experimental studies that suggested vaccination could select for novel antigenic variants. The researchers note that their results may not be generalizable to other geographic regions, influenza seasons, or subtypes, but provide valuable insights into the evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses within hosts. The study's findings have implications for understanding the larger evolutionary patterns of influenza viruses and may inform strategies for controlling the spread of the virus.
Researchers have developed a new approach to combat visceral leishmaniasis, a severe disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. They genetically modified the parasite to make it less virulent, creating a live attenuated version called LdCen-/-, and tested its ability to induce a protective immune response in both young and aged mice. The study found that LdCen-/- parasites triggered a strong innate and adaptive immune response in young mice, which provided significant protection against the disease. However, in aged mice, the immune response was weaker, resulting in less protection against the disease.

The researchers analyzed the immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from both young and aged mice after infection with LdCen-/- parasites. They found that the parasites enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in both age groups, which is crucial for effective clearance of the parasite. The study also showed that LdCen-/- immunized mice from both age groups developed a Th1-type immune response, characterized by the production of IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2, which is essential for controlling the infection.

In vivo studies demonstrated that immunization with LdCen-/- protected both young and aged mice from a challenge with virulent L. donovani parasites. However, the protection was less effective in aged mice, which had a weaker adaptive immune response compared to young mice. The results suggest that LdCen-/- immunization is a promising approach for developing a vaccine against visceral leishmaniasis, but further research is needed to improve its efficacy in aged individuals.
Researchers created chimeric viruses by combining genetic material from two types of enteroviruses, EV-D68 and EV-D94, to study the role of their capsid proteins in determining viral behavior. Enteroviruses are a diverse group of viruses that cause a range of human diseases, including respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. The study found that the capsid proteins, which form the outer layer of the virus, play a crucial role in determining the virus's sensitivity to acid, its ability to infect specific tissues, and its optimal growth temperature. The researchers created chimeric viruses by swapping the capsid proteins of EV-D68, a respiratory virus, with those of EV-D94, an enteric virus. They found that the chimeric viruses with the EV-D68 capsid proteins were able to infect respiratory tissues and were sensitive to acid, while those with the EV-D94 capsid proteins were able to infect intestinal tissues and were more resistant to acid. The study also found that the capsid proteins determine the optimal growth temperature of the virus, with the EV-D68 capsid proteins allowing the virus to grow best at lower temperatures. Additionally, the researchers found that the non-structural proteins of the virus, rather than the capsid proteins, play a key role in modulating the host's immune response. The study's findings provide new insights into the biology of enteroviruses and could aid in the development of new treatments and vaccines.
The Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-gI acts as a transmembrane Fc receptor on the surface of infected cells and virions, binding to human immunoglobulin G (hIgG). This receptor can also facilitate antibody bipolar bridging (ABB), a process where the antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) of IgG bind to a viral antigen while the Fc region binds to gE-gI. Researchers created an in vitro model system to study the trafficking of ABB complexes and found that cells expressing gE-gI and the viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-gD IgG and gD in a gE-gI-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests that gE-gI can mediate the clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral host IgG and viral antigens, allowing the virus to evade IgG-mediated responses. The study demonstrates a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis.
Researchers have studied the transcriptome profiles of the protoscoleces (PSCs) of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasite that causes cystic hydatid disease in humans and animals worldwide. The study aimed to understand how PSCs adapt to their hosts and evade the immune system. Using advanced sequencing technology and in silico analysis, the researchers identified 26,514 non-redundant sequences, of which 22,910 were mapped to the E. granulosus genome. The analysis revealed 2,280 excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs) released by the parasite, including 138 involved in carbohydrate metabolism and 124 involved in protein metabolism. Eleven ESPs were found to regulate glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, while 44 antigenic proteins, 25 molecular chaperones, and four proteases were highly represented. The study also found that many proteins were enriched in development-related signaling pathways, such as the TGF-β receptor pathways and insulin pathways. These findings provide valuable insights into the metabolic adaptation of the parasite and can aid in the development of novel intervention targets for hydatid treatment and control. The study adds to the existing knowledge of the genomics of E. granulosus and deepens our understanding of host-parasite interactions.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the protein NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a key source of nitrogen in soil. When nitrate is present, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and activates genes involved in nitrate assimilation. However, when nitrate is absent, NirA is exported from the nucleus and becomes inactive. Researchers have discovered that a specific methionine residue in NirA's nuclear export sequence (NES) is oxidized to methionine sulfoxide in the absence of nitrate. This oxidation is mediated by the enzyme FmoB, a flavin-containing monooxygenase. The oxidation status of this methionine residue determines NirA's subcellular distribution and activity. When the methionine is oxidized, NirA is exported from the nucleus and becomes inactive. In contrast, when the methionine is reduced, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and activates genes involved in nitrate assimilation. The researchers found that replacing the methionine residue with isoleucine, a sterically similar but non-oxidizable residue, resulted in partial loss of NirA activity and insensitivity to FmoB-mediated nuclear export. Replacing the methionine with alanine, on the other hand, transformed NirA into a permanently nuclear and active transcription factor. These findings suggest that the oxidation status of the methionine residue in NirA's NES is a key regulatory mechanism controlling NirA's activity and subcellular distribution in response to nitrate availability.
Researchers studied how constraints shape the evolution of voltage-gated sodium channels in mammals. These channels are crucial for allowing action potentials to propagate. Mathematical models have suggested that sodium channel properties need to be tightly constrained for this to happen. There are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels, many of which are highly similar in sequence. This similarity implies that their functional properties are also similar, consistent with the idea that these properties must be tightly constrained. However, the presence of multiple genes raises the question of why there are so many. The researchers demonstrated that the simplest theoretical constraints bounding sodium channel diversity - the requirements of membrane excitability and the uniqueness of the resting potential - directly constrain sodium channel properties. They compared these constraints with functional data on mammalian sodium channel properties collected from the literature, including 172 different sets of measurements from 40 publications, wild-type and mutant, under various conditions. The data from all channel types, including mutants, obey the excitability constraint, but channels expressed in muscle tend to obey the constraint of a unique resting potential, while channels expressed in neuronal tissue do not. The excitability properties alone distinguish the nine sodium channels into four different groups that are consistent with phylogenetic analysis. The researchers' calculations suggest interpretations for the functional differences between these groups.
Researchers have been searching for new antiviral drugs to combat serious influenza infections, which are often resistant to current treatments. The influenza virus's polymerase enzyme, responsible for transcribing and replicating its genetic material, is a promising target for these new drugs. The polymerase is a complex enzyme made up of three subunits: PA, PB1, and PB2. Recent studies have focused on the PA endonuclease domain, which plays a crucial role in the virus's transcription mechanism. This mechanism, known as cap-snatching, allows the virus to hijack the host cell's machinery to replicate its genetic material.

To develop more effective antiviral drugs, researchers need to understand how specific inhibitors bind to the PA endonuclease domain. In this study, scientists used X-ray crystallography to determine the high-resolution structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) PA endonuclease domain bound to several specific inhibitors. These inhibitors, including four diketo compounds and a green tea catechin, chelate the two critical manganese ions in the active site of the enzyme. The researchers found that different substituent groups on the basic metal binding scaffold can bind in distinct sub-pockets within the active site cavity, and that certain structural elements of the active site cavity are flexible, allowing for induced fit binding. These findings will help guide the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the cap-snatching endonuclease activity of the influenza virus polymerase. This research aims to develop novel and efficacious influenza therapeutics that directly target viral replication.
Researchers have developed an effective immunization protocol to produce potent polyspecific antivenom against three medically important vipers: Calloselasma rhodostoma, Cryptelytrops albolabris, and Daboia siamensis. These snakes are found in Thailand and neighboring countries and are responsible for a significant number of snakebite-related deaths. The new protocol uses a "low dose, low volume, multi-site" approach, which has been shown to be effective in producing antivenom against elapid venoms. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three viper venoms, resulting in a rapid rise in antibody levels and a plateau at around the 8th week post-immunization. The resulting antivenom was found to be highly effective in neutralizing the venom of all three snakes, as well as their procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities. The potency of the antivenom was significantly higher than the minimum required by the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute. This new protocol has the potential to save lives by providing a more effective and affordable treatment for snakebite victims. The antivenom has been commercialized in the form of F(ab')2 and is now available for use in Southeast Asian countries where these snakes are found. The success of this protocol could also be applied to the production of antivenom against other snake species, as well as other diseases such as tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies.
Researchers have identified a key protein, SseI, produced by the Salmonella bacteria that causes systemic infections. This protein is injected into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenicity Island 2 (SPI2) type III secretion system. SseI is essential for the bacteria to maintain a long-term chronic infection in mice. It does this by inhibiting the normal migration of immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, which are crucial for fighting off infections. SseI achieves this by binding to a host protein called IQGAP1, which regulates cell migration. This interaction prevents the immune cells from reaching the spleen, where they would normally help to clear the infection. As a result, mice infected with Salmonella that produce SseI have fewer immune cells in their spleens compared to those infected with Salmonella that do not produce SseI. The researchers found that a mutation in SseI that eliminates its ability to bind to IQGAP1 also eliminates its ability to inhibit immune cell migration. This suggests that SseI's interaction with IQGAP1 is essential for its function. Overall, the study shows that SseI plays a critical role in Salmonella's ability to evade the host's immune system and maintain a long-term infection.
Researchers have identified a key factor contributing to the high virulence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA). They found that a mobile genetic element called SCCmec-encoded psm-mec RNA suppresses the translation of the agrA gene, which encodes a positive transcription factor for the production of a cytolytic toxin called PSMα. PSMα is a major contributor to the virulence of S. aureus. The psm-mec gene is present in hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) but not in CA-MRSA. The researchers discovered that psm-mec RNA specifically binds to agrA mRNA and inhibits its translation, reducing the production of PSMα. They also found that 25% of HA-MRSA isolates had a mutation in the psm-mec promoter that reduced its expression, and 9% of the strains lacked the psm-mec gene altogether. In these mutated or deleted strains, PSMα production was increased, similar to that of CA-MRSA. Deletion of psm-mec from HA-MRSA strains led to increased expression of AgrA and PSMα, and increased virulence in mice. The study suggests that the absence of psm-mec in CA-MRSA is a key factor in its high virulence. The researchers propose that identifying mutations in the psm-mec gene could be a new way to predict the virulence of MRSA strains.
Researchers have been studying a phenomenon called antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in the context of dengue virus (DENV) infection. ADE occurs when maternal antibodies, passed from mother to child, fail to neutralize the virus and instead enhance its replication, leading to more severe disease. This has been observed in babies born to dengue-immune mothers who develop severe disease upon primary infection with a different DENV serotype.

To replicate this phenomenon in a mouse model, researchers used type I interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice (A129) born to DENV1-immune mothers. The mice were infected with DENV2 and showed enhanced disease severity, characterized by increased virus titers, vascular leakage, and eventual death. However, the researchers wanted to create a model that was less immunocompromised, as dengue occurs in immune-competent individuals.

They successfully created an ADE model in A129 mice born to DENV1-immune mothers, which showed clinical manifestations similar to those observed in severe dengue patients, including liver damage, vascular leakage, and thrombocytopenia. Treatment with anti-TNFα therapy completely protected the mice, while blocking IL-6 did not impact the virus titers or disease outcome. This new model may help researchers understand the mechanisms of dengue pathogenesis and evaluate the efficacy of vaccine and therapeutic candidates.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania infantum, in the Americas. They analyzed 51 studies and found that male sex was linked to the disease in studies using the leishmanin skin test for diagnosis, but not in those using serological tests. Younger individuals were less likely to be infected, but more prone to illness. The presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were also associated with L. infantum infection. However, the presence of chickens in the house and nutritional status were not linked to the disease.

The study's findings suggest that dogs may serve as a marker for the occurrence of visceral leishmaniasis among humans. This is consistent with ecological studies that have shown a link between dog seropositivity and human infection. The researchers note that their results cannot be applied to other contexts, as the disease dynamics in the Americas differ from those in other regions. The study highlights the need for further research in new areas of the continent, with improved methodological quality, to better understand the patterns and causes of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. The findings can inform the development of more effective and targeted control measures to combat the disease.
Researchers studied the immune response in mice infected with Francisella tularensis, the bacteria that causes tularemia. They found that when mice inhaled the bacteria, their immune system responded by recruiting large numbers of immature myeloid cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the lungs. These cells failed to mature and died, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of lung function, and death. The researchers discovered that this response was responsible for the rapid lethality of the infection, rather than the amount of bacteria present or the production of inflammatory cytokines.

In contrast, when mice were infected with a less virulent strain of the bacteria, their immune response was characterized by the recruitment of mature neutrophils and monocytes, which helped to control the infection. The study suggests that the nature of the myeloid cell response may be the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection. The researchers found that the recruitment of immature myeloid cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the lungs and spleen was a critical factor in the development of necrotizing inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, leading to host death. The study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of tularemia and highlights the importance of the innate myeloid cell response in determining the outcome of the infection.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is a global concern due to its rapid spread and potential to transmit infectious diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Researchers used a combination of classical population genetics and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) approaches to reconstruct the colonization pattern of this mosquito. The study found that in its native Southeast Asian range, populations from China, Thailand, and Japan have high genetic connectivity, indicating a common ancestral origin. China appears to be the oldest population.

Outside of Southeast Asia, the invasion process of Aedes albopictus is primarily driven by a chaotic propagule distribution, facilitated by human activity. This distribution has resulted in high genetic diversity within adventive populations. The study suggests that independent and trans-continental introductions of the mosquito may have contributed to the rapid establishment of adventive populations through admixture of unrelated genomes.

The findings have implications for predicting the risk of vector outbreaks and assessing the risk of arbovirus outbreaks in newly invaded areas. The study also highlights the importance of considering the interactions between genetic factors and environmental landscapes in understanding the variation in vector competence for different arboviruses. The research provides valuable information on the origins of Aedes albopictus populations from various regions, including the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Basin, the Pacific Ocean islands, and North America.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa grows and thrives in chronic wounds. They found that the bacteria's ability to grow in high-density environments, rather than its virulence or ability to form biofilms, is key to its success in chronic wounds. In contrast to what was previously thought, the bacteria's ability to cause disease and form biofilms was not as important for its survival in wounds. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolic pathways, and membrane integrity were crucial for the bacteria's fitness in wounds. The researchers also found that the bacteria's ability to grow in high-density environments was a major factor in its ability to thrive in wounds, even in the absence of a host. This study sheds light on the bacterial functions needed to cause chronic wound infections and the stresses that affect bacterial fitness in wounds. The findings suggest that targeting the bacteria's ability to grow in high-density environments could be a potential therapeutic strategy to combat chronic wound infections. The study used a mouse model of diabetic wounds, which is relevant to human wound pathogenesis, and found that Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibited wound healing in the model, directly linking infection to disease. Overall, the study provides new insights into the biology of chronic wound infections and potential therapeutic targets.
Researchers conducted a study on chronic hydrocele, a common manifestation of bancroftian filariasis, a disease prevalent in 80 countries. The study involved 1,128 patients with uni- or bilateral filarial hydrocele and a comparison group of 218 patients who had undergone hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere. The results showed that hydrocele recurrence rates were significantly lower in patients who underwent complete excision of the hydrocele sac (0.3%) compared to those who underwent hydrocele-sac-sparing hydrocelectomy (19.3%). The study also found that per-surgically leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels were present in 30.9% and 46.3% of patients in the two groups, respectively. Additionally, the testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 18% and 35.7% of patients in the two groups, respectively. The study suggests that lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic vessels is an important component of chronic filarial hydrocele fluid, which threatens the integrity of the testis in adult populations living in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas. The authors recommend complete excision of the hydrocele sac and suturing or excising leaking or leak-prone dilated lymphatic vessels to prevent hydrocele recurrence. The study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of chronic hydrocele in bancroftian filariasis endemic areas and highlights the importance of complete excision of the hydrocele sac in preventing recurrence.
Researchers have identified a deubiquitinating enzyme, TsUCH37, in the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis, which causes trichinellosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. This enzyme is a cysteine protease and is putatively orthologous to the human protein UCH-L5. The study used an activity-based probe to identify deubiquitinating activity in T. spiralis larvae and found that TsUCH37 associates with the proteasome, a complex involved in protein degradation. The interaction between TsUCH37 and the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution.

The researchers used a small molecule inhibitor, LDN-57444, to block the activity of TsUCH37 and found that it reduced the viability of cultured T. spiralis larvae. This suggests that UCH enzymes, including TsUCH37, play an important role in parasite biology. The study also identified several other potential deubiquitinating enzymes in T. spiralis, including UCH-L3, HAUSP, OTU 6B, and Ataxin-3.

The discovery of TsUCH37 and its interaction with the proteasome provides new insights into the biology of T. spiralis and has potential implications for the development of therapeutic targets for trichinellosis. The study highlights the importance of understanding the role of deubiquitinating enzymes in parasite biology and their potential as targets for drug development.
Researchers have identified new compounds that show promise in treating Chagas disease, a tropical illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. The compounds, known as nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors, were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of T. cruzi in the lab. Three of the compounds showed significant anti-trypanosomal activity, meaning they were able to slow or stop the growth of the parasite, at concentrations as low as 0.1-1 micromolar. This is a promising finding, as it suggests that these compounds may be effective in treating Chagas disease.

The researchers also found that the anti-trypanosomal activity of two of the compounds was greater than what would be expected based on their ability to inhibit a related enzyme, cruzain. This suggests that these compounds may have a "polypharmacological profile," meaning they may target multiple enzymes or pathways in the parasite, rather than just one. This is an important finding, as it could lead to the development of more effective treatments for Chagas disease.

The study also highlights the potential of cathepsin K inhibitors as a new class of antichagasic agents. Cathepsin K is an enzyme that is similar to cruzain, and the researchers found that potent inhibitors of cathepsin K showed significant anti-trypanosomal activity. This suggests that targeting cathepsin K may be a viable strategy for developing new treatments for Chagas disease.
Researchers have created a detailed physical map of the maize genome, which covers 93.5% of the genome and is aligned to 86.1% of the genetic map. The map contains 25,908 genic markers, allowing for the alignment of nearly 73% of the anchored maize genome to the rice genome. The study reveals that the maize genome has undergone significant changes since its divergence from the rice genome, including a 6-fold expansion in size. This expansion is attributed to the recent polyploid origin of maize, which resulted in most rice regions corresponding to two regions in maize. Inversions account for the majority of chromosome structural variations during the subsequent diploidization of the maize genome. The researchers also found evidence of an ancient genome duplication that predates the divergence of the progenitors of maize and rice. By comparing the maize and rice genomes, the study sheds light on the organization of the chromosomes of the progenitors contributing to the maize polyploidization and the rearrangements associated with the subsequent diploidization of the maize genome. The findings suggest that the present maize genome emerged from the tetraploidization of several ancient duplicated regions, with multiple duplication events contributing to its complex duplication pattern. The study provides a framework for understanding the evolution of the maize genome and its complex structure.
Researchers have successfully generated infectious prions in a laboratory setting, mimicking a key event in the development of sporadic prion disease. Prions are misfolded proteins that cause a group of fatal brain diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. The study used a technique called protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) to induce the misfolding of a normal prion protein (PrPC) into a disease-causing form (PrPSc) in the absence of any existing PrPSc. This was achieved in different animal species, including hamsters, at a low and variable rate. The newly generated PrPSc was found to be infectious and caused a new disease phenotype with distinct clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. This finding supports the prion hypothesis, which suggests that prions are composed solely of misfolded PrPSc that replicates by inducing the misfolding of PrPC. The study also suggests that prion diversity may be greater than previously thought, and that new forms of infectious protein folding may lead to novel disease phenotypes. The results provide a simple model to study the mechanism of sporadic prion disease and have implications for our understanding of the origins of prion diseases.
Researchers have developed a new model, the Angular Velocity Detector Unit (AVDU), to estimate angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain. This model can reproduce experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees, including previously unexplained behaviors. The AVDU is based on electrophysiological data and is tested using behavioral data. The model suggests that the AV response is an evolutionary extension of the optomotor response.

The AVDU is designed to account for deviations in the corridor-centering response of the bee, including the deviation of the average flight path from the corridor center according to differences in spatial frequency of sinusoidal gratings on opposite walls. The model also reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behavior.

The AVDU is tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate down a corridor with gratings on the walls. When combined with an existing flight control algorithm, the detector reproduces the invariance of the average flight path to the spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings. Additionally, the summed response of the detector to a unit distance movement along the corridor is constant for a large range of grating spatial frequencies, demonstrating that the detector can be used as a visual odometer. This suggests that the AV response can be used to estimate distance by summing the detector output over time and over all parts of the visual field.
Untreated Human Infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense Are Not 100% Fatal

A long-term follow-up study of 50 patients with human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in the Ivory Coast found that 11 patients refused treatment after initial diagnosis. Despite repeated visits, 10 of these patients showed parasite clearance using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Most of these patients (7/10) also displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming progressively negative to trypanosome variable antigens. The study found two alternative natural progressions of HAT, in addition to the "classic" lethal outcome: progression to an apparently aparasitaemic and asymptomatic infection associated with strong long-lasting serological responses, and progression to an apparently spontaneous resolution of infection with negative results in parasitological tests and PCR. These findings suggest that trypanotolerance exists in humans, similar to what is known in animals. The study's results are based on clinical, serological, molecular, and parasitological investigations using field diagnostic tools and highly specific and sensitive laboratory tests. The study's findings have significant implications for future research in the field of HAT, particularly in understanding the natural evolution of the disease in its human host.
Researchers investigated how ionizing radiation affects the development of cancer, specifically focusing on the role of the p53 gene, a key tumor suppressor. They used mouse models to study the effects of radiation on hematopoietic progenitor cells, which give rise to blood cells. The study aimed to determine whether radiation selects for cells that are deficient in p53, making them more likely to develop cancer.

The results showed that radiation does indeed select for p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitor cells, leading to their long-term expansion and increased cancer development. This selection is attributed to several factors, including protection from radiation-induced cell death, prevention of loss of clonogenic capacity, improved long-term maintenance of progenitor cell fitness, and elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors.

The study suggests that the carcinogenic effect of ionizing radiation can be partly explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, which protects progenitor cells from immediate elimination and long-term reductions in fitness following radiation. The findings indicate that the causal link between radiation exposure, p53 disruption, and cancer involves selection for p53 loss rather than solely irradiation-induced mutagenesis at loci encoding proliferation control genes.
Researchers have identified a protein called SmKI-1 in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni that plays a crucial role in the parasite's survival and development. SmKI-1 is a serine protease inhibitor that can bind to and block the activity of neutrophil elastase, a key enzyme in the human immune system that helps fight off infections. By inhibiting neutrophil elastase, SmKI-1 helps the parasite evade the host's immune response and survive in the human body.

The study found that SmKI-1 not only inhibits neutrophil elastase but also impairs the function of neutrophils, which are a type of white blood cell that plays a key role in inflammation. The researchers tested SmKI-1 in different models of inflammatory diseases, including liver damage and gout arthritis, and found that it reduced inflammation and improved symptoms.

The study suggests that SmKI-1 could be a potential therapeutic molecule for treating inflammatory diseases. The researchers also found that SmKI-1 is essential for the parasite's survival and development, and that suppressing its expression in the parasite significantly impaired its ability to develop and thrive in the human body.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of SmKI-1 in the parasite's survival and development, and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for treating inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a new method to accurately model the structures of transmembrane helical (TMH) proteins, which are crucial for various cellular functions. These proteins are difficult to study due to the lack of close structural homologues, making it hard to predict their high-resolution structures. The new method uses distant homologues with distinct loop and TMH conformations to create accurate models. In a benchmark of 50 TMH protein pairs with diverse topologies, sizes, and sequence identities, the method improved most starting templates and achieved near-atomic accuracy in predicting membrane-embedded regions. The models were also suitable for computer-based protein engineering, with redesigned models and X-ray structures showing similar native interactions. The method was validated in two blind predictions and a large benchmark, where it was ranked first in accuracy for full-length receptor structures. The technique was tested on the adenosine A2AR and chemokine CXCR4 receptors, achieving accurate predictions despite the lack of close structural homologues. The method has the potential to aid in the design of effective therapeutics and receptors with novel functions for systems and synthetic biology applications, which rely on atomic-resolution information.
Listeria monocytogenes, a bacterium that causes listeriosis, a serious foodborne disease, has been found to switch from an active, motile lifestyle to a state of persistence in vacuoles within host cells. In human hepatocytes and trophoblast cells, the bacteria initially proliferate in the cytosol and use the host's actin polymerization machinery to spread from cell to cell. However, after several days of infection, the bacteria stop producing the actin-nucleating protein ActA and become trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles called Listeria-Containing Vacuoles (LisCVs). A subpopulation of bacteria resists degradation in these vacuoles and enters a slow, non-replicative state. The bacteria can then cycle between the vacuolar and actin-based motility stages. When ActA is absent, such as in mutants, the bacteria enter a "viable but non-culturable" state, making them undetectable by conventional methods. Exposure to high doses of gentamicin selects for vacuolar and "viable but non-culturable" bacteria. These findings suggest that Listeria monocytogenes can enter a persistent state in a subset of epithelial cells, potentially leading to asymptomatic carriage, prolonged incubation periods, and increased survival during antibiotic therapy. This new understanding of the bacterium's lifecycle may have significant implications for the treatment and prevention of listeriosis.
Researchers have developed a neuromechanistic model to study auditory streaming, a phenomenon where the brain interprets a sequence of high and low frequency tones as either a single stream or separate streams. The model is based on physiological studies of the auditory cortex and general models of perceptual bistability. It incorporates sound-evoked responses from the primary auditory cortex (A1) as input to a competition network, where perceptual states are identified in the neuronal dynamics rather than pre-assigned to specific units. The model includes NMDA-like synaptic dynamics to enable temporal binding from one triplet to the next, allowing it to deal with gaps in the periodic sound input.

The model predicts that manipulating the frequency difference between tones A and B should affect the dominance durations of the stronger percept more than those of the weaker percept. This prediction is confirmed by psychoacoustic experiments, and the behavioral data is used to further constrain and improve the model, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. The model provides a platform that can be extended to consider other stimulus conditions, including the effects of context and volition.

The model's focus on alternations after the build-up phase and its neuromechanistic formulation distinguish it from existing auditory models. Parameters controlling the balance between adaptation and noise were tuned to match the statistics of perceptual durations, and A1 responses were interpreted using neurometric functions that mimic the time course of build-up. The model suggests that inputs should be dynamic and depend on perceptual state, rather than simply increasing stimulus strength to favor the attended percept.
Researchers have developed a new method to assess the allergenicity of proteins from the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni. This method uses a humanized cell line, called RS-ATL8, which can detect when a protein is recognized by the immune system as an allergen. The researchers used a cell-free translation system to produce large amounts of S. mansoni proteins, and then tested these proteins on the RS-ATL8 cell line to see if they triggered an allergic response. The results showed that some S. mansoni proteins, such as SmTAL-1, were able to activate the cell line, while others, like SmTAL-2, did not. The researchers also tested well-characterized allergens from other sources, such as plants and other parasites, and found that the method worked as expected. This method has the potential to be used for high-throughput analysis of the allergenicity of S. mansoni proteins, which could lead to a better understanding of the relationship between parasite-specific IgE and host protection mechanisms. The researchers believe that this method could be used to unravel the entire allergome of S. mansoni and other medically important parasites, ultimately leading to the development of safe and effective vaccines against helminthic parasites.
Researchers studied the effects of transposable elements (TEs) on gene expression in a hybrid dysgenic syndrome of Drosophila virilis. They found that when TEs inherited from the father are not matched with corresponding silencing PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provided by the mother's germline, they can become activated in the offspring, causing germline damage and sterility. The study showed that divergence in the TE landscape between parents leads to persisting differences in germline TE expression in genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses. These differences are transmitted to the next generation and coincide with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. The researchers also found that gene expression is influenced by differences in the genic piRNA profile of the parents, which arise from polymorphic TE insertions. This suggests that early germline events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of TE and gene expression in the germline that is maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation. The study demonstrates that divergence in the TE profile is associated with diverse piRNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.
Fragile X Tremor Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the FMR1 gene. The expanded repeat is thought to induce toxicity as RNA, leading to increased levels of FMR1 mRNA. However, the mechanism behind this increase is unknown. Researchers have found that overexpressing certain histone deacetylases (HDACs) suppresses CGG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FXTAS. This suppression is due to selective transcriptional repression of the CGG repeat-containing transgene. The study also found that histone acetylation at the FMR1 locus is increased in pre-mutation carriers compared to control or FXS-derived cell lines. This epigenetic change correlates with elevated FMR1 mRNA expression in pre-mutation cell lines. Furthermore, histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitors repress FMR1 mRNA expression to control levels in pre-mutation carrier cell lines and extend lifespan in CGG repeat-expressing Drosophila. These findings suggest that the CGG repeat expansion in FXTAS promotes chromatin remodeling, leading to increased expression of the toxic FMR1 mRNA. The study provides proof of principle that HAT inhibitors or HDAC activators might be used to selectively repress transcription at the FMR1 locus, offering a potential therapeutic approach for FXTAS.
Research has shown that CD8 T cells play a crucial role in controlling chronic viral infections. However, the effectiveness of CD8 T cell responses can be influenced by various factors, including the host's genetic makeup. A recent study investigated the impact of host genetics on CD8 T cell function and the development of chronic viral infection in mice infected with the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). The study found that mice with more diverse major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles, which are proteins that help the immune system distinguish between self and non-self, were better at controlling the virus and clearing it from the body. However, this increased effectiveness came at the cost of enhanced immunopathology, or tissue damage caused by the immune response. The study also found that the genetic background of the host played a significant role in determining the outcome of the infection, with some mice succumbing to the virus while others were able to control it. The research suggests that increasing MHC diversity allows for a broader CD8 T cell response, which can more rapidly control persistent LCMV infection, but also increases the risk of immunopathology. The study's findings have important implications for understanding how to prevent chronic viral infections and the mechanisms that induce an effective CD8 T cell response.
Researchers studied the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax, in northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. They analyzed 106 strains of the bacteria from six provinces, including Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia. The study found that five sublineages of B. anthracis were present in the region, including A. Br. 001/002, A. Br. Vollum, A. Br. Aust94, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br. 008/009. These sublineages were found in different provinces, with A. Br. 001/002 and A. Br. Ames being the most common.

The researchers used two methods to analyze the genetic characteristics of the bacteria: canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism (canSNP) analysis and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers. They found that the geographical distribution of the B. anthracis populations had changed over time, with the A. Br. Ames subgroup being found in more provinces than previously reported. The study also identified 21 new MLVA genotypes, which were not previously known.

The researchers suggest that the diversification of MLVA genotypes and the geographical distribution of B. anthracis populations is becoming more balanced across northwestern China. This study provides valuable information on the population diversity of B. anthracis in China, which can help with prevention and control of the disease.
Researchers studied how the body defends against a type of bacteria that can cause severe diarrhea. They found that a protein called RELM-β, produced by cells in the intestines called goblet cells, plays a crucial role in this defense. RELM-β attracts a type of immune cell called CD4+ T cells to the site of infection, which helps to promote the growth of new intestinal cells to replace those damaged by the bacteria. This process helps to prevent the bacteria from penetrating deeper into the intestinal lining and causing more severe damage.

In the study, mice that lacked the RELM-β gene were more susceptible to the bacteria and suffered from more severe intestinal damage. However, when RELM-β was delivered directly to the intestines of these mice, it restored the recruitment of CD4+ T cells and promoted the growth of new intestinal cells, reducing the severity of the infection.

The researchers also found that RELM-β does not directly stimulate the growth of new intestinal cells, but rather acts as a signal that attracts CD4+ T cells to the site of infection. These T cells then produce a protein called IL-22, which promotes the growth of new intestinal cells. The study suggests that goblet cells, which produce RELM-β, play a critical role in recruiting immune cells to the intestines to defend against enteric pathogens.
Researchers have discovered a crucial interaction between a specific part of the norovirus protein VPg and a protein called eIF4G in the host cell. This interaction is essential for the initiation of protein synthesis in noroviruses, which are a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans. Noroviruses do not have a traditional "cap" on their RNA, so they use a different mechanism to start protein synthesis. The researchers found that a 20-amino acid sequence at the end of the VPg protein is responsible for binding to the HEAT-1 domain of eIF4G. This binding site is conserved in all known noroviruses, suggesting that it is a key feature of the virus's ability to replicate. The researchers used various biochemical and biophysical techniques to study the interaction between VPg and eIF4G, including pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. They found that the VPg protein binds to eIF4G in a specific way, and that this binding is necessary for the virus to initiate protein synthesis. The researchers also showed that a fusion protein containing the C-terminal peptide of VPg can inhibit the translation of norovirus RNA, suggesting that this interaction could be a potential target for antiviral therapy. Overall, this study provides important insights into the mechanism of norovirus replication and identifies a potential new target for the development of antiviral treatments.
Researchers investigated the conditions under which gene clusters evolve in bacterial genomes. Gene clusters are groups of genes that encode proteins involved in a common pathway and are often found near each other on a chromosome. Several theories have been proposed to explain the evolution of these clusters, including the selfish operon model, which suggests that clustered genes are more easily transferred between species, and the persistence model, which proposes that clustered genes are less likely to be disrupted by DNA deletions or insertions. The researchers developed computational models to study the conditions under which gene clusters can evolve and persist. They found that gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions, but that certain factors can promote their evolution, including a low number of genes in the pathway, a high population size, and a high rate of horizontal gene transfer. The selfish operon model remains a viable explanation for the evolution of gene clusters under these conditions. However, the model is unable to explain the observation that genes in clusters are often arranged in the order of biochemical reactions, suggesting that multiple mechanisms may be involved. The researchers also found that the persistence model, which does not require direct selection, can explain the clustering of essential genes.
Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, poses a significant threat to pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to severe consequences due to the parasite's ability to adhere to the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a unique variant of the PfEMP1 antigen, called VAR2CSA, which binds to chondroitin sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts in the placenta. VAR2CSA is only expressed in the presence of a placenta, suggesting that its expression is actively repressed in men, children, and non-pregnant women.

Researchers have discovered that the gene encoding VAR2CSA contains a small upstream open reading frame (uORF) that acts to repress translation of the resulting mRNA. This mechanism is reversible, allowing high levels of protein translation upon selection, potentially enabling parasites to upregulate expression of this variant antigen in the presence of the appropriate host tissue. The uORF is not spliced out and is present in the mRNA, indicating that VAR2CSA is encoded by a bicistronic transcript.

Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms used by malaria parasites to regulate VAR2CSA expression and protein expression in general, which will provide insights into the molecular basis of the host-parasite interactions underlying the pathogenesis of the disease. The conservation of the var2csa gene in most Plasmodium falciparum isolates and its presence in the chimpanzee parasite Plasmodium reichenowi suggest a selective pressure acting on the preservation of this gene.
Researchers studied gene expression patterns in children infected with dengue virus (DENV) in Nicaragua to understand why some people develop severe symptoms while others do not. They analyzed blood samples from 34 infected children on days 3-6 of their illness and found significant differences in gene expression between those with severe symptoms, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and shock, and those with milder symptoms. The most notable differences were in genes related to protein biosynthesis and mitochondrial function, which were more active in children with severe symptoms. In contrast, children with DHF had increased expression of genes involved in innate immunity, such as neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides. A meta-analysis of the data, combined with previously published studies, revealed that DENV infection leads to significant changes in protein and nucleic acid metabolism. However, the interferon response, which is a key part of the immune response, was not consistently observed in the patient samples, suggesting that it may be a transient response. The study highlights the importance of understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying DENV infection and its severity, which could lead to better prediction and treatment of the disease. The findings also suggest that a systems biology approach, combining data from multiple studies, may be useful in identifying commonalities and differences between different manifestations of DENV infection.
Researchers studied how a type of herpesvirus, called Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), enters the body. They found that MuHV-4 targets the olfactory neuroepithelium, a layer of cells in the nose responsible for detecting smells. This area is unique because it has a type of sugar molecule called heparan sulfate (HS) on its surface, which the virus uses to bind and enter the cells.

The study showed that MuHV-4 binds to HS on the surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium and uses it as a key to enter the cells. The virus can then infect either the neurons or the supporting cells called sustentacular cells. The researchers found that the virus's ability to bind to HS is crucial for its entry into the cells, as viruses that cannot bind to HS are unable to infect the cells.

The study suggests that the olfactory neuroepithelium may be an important entry point for many herpesviruses, not just MuHV-4. The researchers propose that targeting the HS on the surface of the olfactory neuroepithelium could be a potential way to prevent herpesvirus infections. They also found that the virus's ability to infect the olfactory neuroepithelium is specific to this area and is not just a result of the virus being inhaled into the lungs.
Researchers have discovered a new regulatory mechanism that helps control the virulence of Salmonella, a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning. The mechanism involves a molecule called CRP-cAMP, which is a well-known regulator of metabolic processes. When CRP-cAMP is present, it helps to silence the expression of genes that are necessary for Salmonella to invade epithelial cells. This silencing occurs at the post-transcriptional level, meaning that CRP-cAMP does not directly affect the transcription of these genes, but rather influences how they are processed after they are transcribed.

The researchers found that in the absence of CRP-cAMP, Salmonella produces more of a protein called HilD, which is a key regulator of the bacteria's ability to invade cells. They also discovered that a small RNA molecule called Spot 42 plays a role in this process. Spot 42 is normally under the control of CRP-cAMP, and when CRP-cAMP is absent, Spot 42 is overproduced. Spot 42 then helps to increase the expression of HilD.

The study suggests that CRP-cAMP plays a crucial role in regulating Salmonella's virulence by controlling the expression of HilD and other genes involved in invasion. The researchers found that Salmonella strains lacking CRP-cAMP are unable to secrete proteins necessary for invasion and are less virulent in a mouse model. These findings highlight the importance of CRP-cAMP in regulating Salmonella's ability to cause disease.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the expansion of CAG/CTG repeats, which causes diseases such as Huntington's disease, and chromatin structure and transcription. They used two types of mice, R6/1 and R6/2, which express a similar transgene but at different sites. The study found that the R6/2 mice had higher levels of CAG instability in certain tissues, such as the striatum, compared to the R6/1 mice. This instability was associated with higher levels of transgene expression and chromatin accessibility. The researchers also found that the levels of histone marks, such as H3K4 trimethylation and H3K36 trimethylation, which are associated with active transcription, were higher in the striatum of R6/2 mice compared to the cerebellum. In contrast, the levels of histone marks associated with heterochromatin, such as H3K9 dimethylation, were lower in the striatum of R6/2 mice. The study suggests that transcription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo and that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability. The results also indicate that the integration site of the transgene influences repeat instability, affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional activity. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying the expansion of CAG/CTG repeats and the development of diseases such as Huntington's disease.
Researchers have identified specific genetic changes in the virus Enterovirus 71 (EV71) that allow it to spread more easily in the human body. EV71 is a highly contagious virus that can cause serious diseases, including neurological complications. To understand how the virus adapts to its host, scientists analyzed the genetic material of the virus from different parts of the body of an immunocompromised patient who had a severe infection. They found three genetic changes in the virus that occurred over a five-day period: a change in a protein called VP1, a substitution in a protein called 2B, and a silent mutation in a protein called 3D. The researchers created copies of the virus with these changes and tested them in the lab to see how they affected the virus's ability to infect cells. They found that the change in VP1, specifically a substitution of the amino acid leucine to arginine at position 97, gave the virus a replicative advantage in cells from the nervous system. This suggests that the VP1 protein plays a critical role in the virus's ability to infect and spread in the body. The study's findings provide new insights into how EV71 adapts to its host and may help in the development of treatments or vaccines against the virus.
Researchers studied how certain bacteria called Streptococcus recognize and respond to chemical signals, called pheromones, that help them take in new DNA from their environment. This process, called natural transformation, allows bacteria to quickly acquire new traits, such as resistance to antibiotics. The researchers focused on a specific system called ComRS, which is used by many Streptococcus species to regulate this process. They found that different species of Streptococcus have slightly different versions of the proteins involved in this system, which allows them to recognize and respond to their own pheromones, but not those of other species. To understand how this works, the researchers developed a test to measure how different ComR proteins respond to different pheromones. They found that some ComR proteins are very specific and only respond to their own pheromones, while others are more flexible and can respond to multiple pheromones. The researchers also used X-ray crystallography to study the structure of one of these proteins and found that it has a specific pocket that recognizes and binds to pheromones. By studying this pocket, they were able to predict how different pheromones interact with the protein and even design new pheromones that can activate the protein. This research provides a better understanding of how Streptococcus species communicate with each other and how they regulate their ability to take in new DNA. It also lays the groundwork for further studies on the role of the ComRS system in different species of Streptococcus.
Researchers studied the replication of centromeric DNA in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans to understand how centromeres are maintained at specific chromosomal sites over many generations. They found that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that is the first to fire on its respective chromosome, and that epigenetic formation of new centromeres, or neocentromeres, is accompanied by shifts in replication timing. This means that a neocentromere becomes the first to replicate and is associated with components of the origin recognition complex (ORC). The researchers also found that changing the level of a centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to a concomitant change in levels of ORC association with centromere regions. Analysis of centromere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence pattern characteristic of constitutively active replication origins. This pattern is conserved among related strains and species, in a manner independent of primary DNA sequence. The study suggests that the distinct timing of DNA replication serves as an epigenetic mechanism for the inheritance of centromere position. The researchers propose a model in which the distinct timing of DNA replication allows for the inheritance of centromere position, providing a novel mechanism of epigenetic inheritance.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis to identify genetic factors associated with chronic back pain (CBP) in adults of European ancestry. The study included data from 158,025 individuals, including 29,531 cases of CBP, from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biobank. The study found a genome-wide significant association between CBP and a variant in the SOX5 gene, which was replicated in an independent sample of 283,752 UK Biobank participants. The study also identified two other loci that reached genome-wide significance in a joint meta-analysis: an intergenic variant between CCDC26 and GSDMC, and an intronic variant in DCC. These findings suggest that genetic factors play a role in the development of CBP, and that further research is needed to understand the biological mechanisms underlying this condition. The study highlights the importance of standardizing CBP definitions to limit phenotype heterogeneity in future meta-GWAS of CBP. The research was an international collaboration between investigators from the CHARGE Consortium Musculoskeletal Workgroup and the European Union FP7 project Pain-OMICS.
Researchers in Cameroon estimated the burden of Taenia solium cysticercosis, a parasitic disease that affects both humans and pigs. The study found that approximately 50,326 people in West Cameroon have neurocysticercosis-associated epilepsy, representing 1.0% of the local population. Additionally, about 15,961 pigs were diagnosed with cysticercosis, which is 5.6% of the local pig population. The total annual cost of the disease in West Cameroon was estimated at €10,255,202, with 4.7% attributed to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses caused by human cysticercosis. The average number of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) lost per thousand persons per year was 9.0 (95% confidence interval: 2.8-20.4). The study also found that the cost of inactivity, influenced by salaries, plays a significant role in the monetary burden of T. solium cysticercosis. The estimated number of DALYs lost due to the disease was higher than estimates for some other neglected tropical diseases. The study suggests that knowing the salary levels and prevalence of the disease can provide a rapid indication of the total cost of T. solium cysticercosis in a country.
Researchers have identified a non-coding RNA called RsaA in Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that can cause infections in humans. RsaA is a small RNA molecule that does not code for a protein, but instead regulates the expression of other genes. The study found that RsaA reduces the virulence of S. aureus by repressing the synthesis of a global transcriptional regulator called MgrA. MgrA is a master regulator of transcription that controls the expression of many virulence factors and accessory genes in S. aureus. By repressing MgrA, RsaA promotes the formation of biofilms, which are complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces, and inhibits the synthesis of the bacterial capsule, a protective layer that helps the bacteria evade the host immune system. As a result, RsaA decreases the ability of S. aureus to resist opsonophagocytic killing by white blood cells. In animal models, RsaA was found to attenuate the severity of acute systemic infections and enhance chronic catheter infections. The study suggests that RsaA has been positively selected through evolution to support commensalism and saprophytic interactions with the host, meaning that it helps the bacteria coexist with the host without causing harm. This is the first example of a conserved small RNA in S. aureus functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections.
Researchers have developed a new way to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a critical step in the virus's life cycle. Uncoating occurs when the cone-shaped HIV-1 capsid disassembles in target cells, allowing the virus to establish a long-term infection. To study this process, scientists created a fluorescently tagged version of a host protein called cyclophilin A (CypA), which binds to the HIV-1 capsid. This tagged protein, called CypA-DsRed, was incorporated into HIV-1 particles and allowed researchers to track the disassembly of the capsid in real-time.

Using single-virus imaging, researchers observed that CypA-DsRed remained associated with the viral core even after the viral membrane was removed. However, it was lost from the core at the same rate as the capsid itself, both in laboratory experiments and in living cells. The rate of loss was influenced by the stability of the viral core and was accelerated when the virus began to replicate its genetic material. The study found that most viral cores lost CypA-DsRed shortly after fusion with the host cell, while a small fraction remained intact for several hours. The researchers also observed that uncoating occurred both in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. This new imaging technique provides a detailed understanding of the previously poorly understood process of HIV-1 uncoating.
Researchers studied the patterns of DNA sequences in prokaryotic organisms, such as bacteria and archaea, to understand how information is encoded in their genomes. They analyzed the frequency of different-sized DNA sequences, called oligonucleotides, in coding and non-coding regions. The study found that prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, suggesting that information in prokaryotic genomes is encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more within AT-rich and host-associated genomes than in GC-rich and free-living genomes, and this variation was mainly located in non-coding regions. The study also found that bias in tetranucleotide usage correlated with GC content, and coding regions were more biased than non-coding regions. Non-coding regions were found to be approximately 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions, on average, in the 402 chromosomes examined. Pronounced DNA compositional differences were found both within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes. GC-rich genomes were more similar and biased in terms of tetranucleotide usage in non-coding regions than AT-rich genomes. The differences found between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes may be attributed to lifestyle, as tetranucleotide usage within host-associated bacteria was, on average, more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea and bacteria. The study suggests that oligonucleotide sizes larger than hexanucleotides possess little additional information potential in prokaryotic DNA.
Researchers have discovered a previously unknown factor that affects how genetic material is passed down from one generation to the next during meiosis, a process that occurs in reproductive cells. This factor, known as transmission distortion, influences noncrossover recombination, which is a type of genetic exchange that occurs during meiosis. Noncrossover recombination is distinct from crossover recombination, another type of genetic exchange that also occurs during meiosis.

The study found that transmission distortion affects two specific hotspots in the human genome, where genetic material is more likely to be passed down in a biased manner. This bias favors strong (G/C) base pairs over weak (A/T) base pairs, which is consistent with established correlations between high GC content and recombination activity in mammalian genomes. The researchers suggest that this form of biased gene conversion may contribute to the correlation between GC content and recombination, and thus influence the evolution of genomic base composition.

The study analyzed sperm DNA from six highly active hotspots and found that transmission distortion is a powerful and previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive. This drive may affect thousands of recombination hotspots throughout the human genome. The researchers propose that transmission distortion arises from differences in heteroduplex formation and biased mismatch repair between crossovers and noncrossovers. This discovery highlights the complexity of meiotic recombination and the need for further research into the factors that influence this process.
Researchers have developed a new approach to understand how environmental chemicals and drugs affect human health. They created a network that connects chemicals to proteins and diseases, allowing them to predict which chemicals may be risk factors for certain health conditions. This network was built by integrating data from various sources, including toxicogenomics, chemical structures, protein-protein interactions, disease information, and functional annotations.

The researchers used the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) to gather information on 2,490 unique compounds and 6,060 molecular targets involved in human disease. They selected 42,194 associations between these compounds and molecular targets. By analyzing these associations, they identified new connections between chemicals and diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis.

The network can also be used to identify potential molecular targets for specific chemicals, such as di-ethylhexyl-phthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, pirinixic acid, and permethrine. The researchers emphasize that their approach is different from existing computational chemical biology networks, which primarily focus on drugs. Their method integrates toxicogenomics data for both drugs and environmental compounds, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between chemicals and human health.
Researchers have developed a new way to understand how the brain processes sound by creating a "network receptive field" (NRF) model. This model is more complex than the traditional "spectrotemporal receptive field" (STRF) model, which only looks at how a single neuron responds to specific sounds. The NRF model shows that neurons in the primary auditory cortex are sensitive to a much wider range of sounds than previously thought, and that they use complex interactions between different parts of the brain to process sound.

The NRF model reveals that neurons in the auditory cortex are not just responding to individual sounds, but are also combining information from multiple sounds to create a more complete picture of the environment. This is achieved through the interaction of multiple "sub-receptive fields" that work together in a non-linear way. The NRF model also shows that these sub-receptive fields have different properties, such as gain control and conjunctive feature detection, which are important for sound recognition.

The NRF model is more accurate at predicting how neurons respond to sounds than the traditional STRF model, and it provides a more detailed understanding of how the brain processes sound. This new model has the potential to improve our understanding of how the brain recognizes and interprets complex sounds, and could have implications for the development of new treatments for hearing loss and other auditory disorders.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that helps regulate the body's internal clock, which is controlled by a group of genes that work together in a feedback loop. This internal clock, also known as the circadian clock, allows the body to anticipate and respond to the 24-hour day-night cycle. The researchers found that a protein called casein kinase 2 (CK2) plays a crucial role in this process by phosphorylating, or adding a chemical tag to, a protein called BMAL1. This phosphorylation is essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock.

The study revealed that a protein called CRY acts as a repressor, or inhibitor, of CK2's activity towards BMAL1. CRY binds to CK2 and prevents it from phosphorylating BMAL1, creating a negative feedback loop that helps regulate the circadian clock. The researchers also found that CRY has a dual function: it not only represses CK2's activity but also represses the transcription of genes driven by the BMAL1-CLOCK complex.

The study suggests that the CK2-mediated phosphorylation of BMAL1 is a critical event in the mammalian circadian core clock machinery. The researchers propose a model in which CRY-dependent CK2-driven post-translational modification of BMAL1 creates a negative feedback loop that is essential for the proper functioning of the circadian clock. This discovery provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate the body's internal clock and may have implications for understanding and treating circadian-related disorders.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapts to survive in the presence of bile, a substance produced by the liver that has antibacterial properties. They found that sublethal concentrations of a bile salt called sodium deoxycholate (DOC) can adapt Salmonella to survive lethal concentrations of bile. This adaptation is associated with changes in gene expression, including the upregulation of the RpoS-dependent general stress response and other stress responses. The researchers also discovered that individual cells within a population can become resistant to bile without the need for adaptation, and that this resistance can be caused by mutations in the lipopolysaccharide transport machinery. However, they also found that some cells can become resistant to bile through a non-mutational process, where they activate stress response genes in the absence of bile. This phenomenon, called "adaptation," is thought to be relevant during Salmonella colonization of the hepatobiliary tract. The study suggests that Salmonella can adapt to bile through multiple mechanisms, including mutation and non-mutational processes, and that this adaptation may be influenced by the presence of bile itself. The findings have implications for our understanding of how Salmonella survives in the presence of bile and may provide insights into the development of new treatments for infections caused by this bacterium.
Researchers have found that the E. coli chromosome is organized into compact, supercoiled domains, which are maintained by both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. One of these domains is formed by the prophage Mu, a type of virus that infects E. coli. The prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain, bounded by its termini L and R, which are 37 kilobases apart on the Mu genome. This domain formation is dependent on a strong gyrase site at the center of Mu, the Mu L end, the MuB protein, and several E. coli nucleoid proteins, including IHF, Fis, and HU. The Mu domain was observed at two different locations on the E. coli chromosome. In contrast, another type of prophage, λ, does not form an independent domain. The researchers found that low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent, promotes the establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain. They propose that the domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by facilitating the topological requirements of the reaction and bringing the Mu ends together. The researchers also suggest that the potential benefits to the host cell from a subset of proteins expressed by the prophage may contribute to its long-term stability.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed antimalarial drug that prevents Plasmodium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears mature Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) gametocytes, reducing post-treatment transmission. A study in Papua New Guinean children found that PQ treatment reduced the incidence of Pv gametocytes by 73%, comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. The majority of Pv and Pf gametocyte-positive infections were asymptomatic. Pv and Pf gametocyte positivity and density were associated with high blood-stage parasite densities. Mixed-species infections had lower odds of gametocytes compared to single-species infections for both species. PQ treatment had no significant effect on Pv gametocyte density or proportion of Pv infections carrying gametocytes. First infections after blood-stage and placebo treatment, likely caused by a relapsing hypnozoite, were equally likely to carry gametocytes as first infections after PQ treatment, likely caused by an infective mosquito bite. Pv relapses and new infections had similar levels of gametocytaemia, highlighting the importance of effective anti-hypnozoite treatment for efficient control of Pv. The study suggests that PQ treatment should be used for all Pv infections to prevent relapses and reduce gametocyte carriage.
Researchers have developed a computational model to analyze the behavior of Rho GTPases, a family of proteins that play a crucial role in various cellular processes such as cell migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis. The model focuses on the cycling of Rho GTPases between the plasma membrane and the cytosol, and how this cycling is regulated by a protein called GDI (GTPase Dissociation Inhibitor). The study found that the details of GTPase cycling are key to understanding how these proteins are differentially regulated in different cellular systems.

The researchers used their model to analyze experimental data on Rac, a member of the Rho GTPase family, and found that the lower affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacGDP can be explained by the faster dissociation of the latter from the membrane. They also developed a set of charts that relate the membrane fraction of GTPases, the two cycling mechanisms, and GDI concentrations. These charts can be used to illustrate the effects of GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase-activating proteins) on the amount of membrane-bound GTPase.

The study suggests that the Rho-GTPase cycling can access qualitatively diverse pathways in different cellular systems or through different experimental manipulations. The model can be used to analyze glucose-stimulated Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells and to assess how targeted modifications may compensate for altered GTPase-GDI balance in disease scenarios. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of Rho GTPases and their role in various cellular processes.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs for schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni, typically focus on collecting data from school-aged children (SAC) due to their high likelihood of infection. However, adults are also likely to be infected, and their infection burden can impact the effectiveness of treatment strategies. Researchers used three different age-intensity profiles of infection with low, moderate, and high burdens of infection in adults to investigate how the age distribution of infection affects the recommended treatment coverage levels required to achieve World Health Organization (WHO) goals.

The study found that in regions with moderate prevalence, treating only SAC may be sufficient to achieve the WHO goals, regardless of the adult infection burden. However, in high-prevalence regions with a high burden of infection in adults, adult treatment is necessary to meet the WHO goals. This suggests that treatment strategies should consider the burden of infection in adults, rather than relying solely on SAC data. The study highlights the importance of collecting prevalence and intensity of infection data from a broader age range, including adults, to determine the optimal treatment strategy for a defined region.

The researchers also emphasize the need for more accurate and detailed data from M&E programs, including individual longitudinal adherence to treatment, to inform treatment strategies. They recommend including adults in treatment and monitoring efforts, particularly in high-risk areas, to prevent a reservoir of infection within the community. The study's findings have implications for the design of M&E programs and the development of effective treatment strategies for schistosomiasis.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict the best targets for surgery in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a condition characterized by recurring seizures. The model uses data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to create a personalized map of brain connections for each patient. By simulating seizures in the model, the researchers found that patients with TLE are more likely to transition from a non-epileptic to an epileptic state than healthy individuals. The model also identified specific brain regions, particularly in the left hemisphere, as the most common starting points for seizures in patients with TLE. These regions include areas in the temporal and subcortical regions, which are known to be involved in TLE. Additionally, the model suggests that regions in the contralateral and frontal locations may play a role in seizure spreading or resistance to surgery. The researchers used the model to simulate surgical resections, removing nodes from patient networks and comparing the likelihood of seizures before and after surgery. The results suggest that patient-specific surgery, where the resection areas are chosen based on individual model predictions, may lead to better outcomes than the standard clinical procedure. This study provides a first step towards developing personalized computational models for epilepsy surgery, which could help inform treatment strategies for individuals with TLE.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses several strategies to evade the host's immune response, including interfering with interferon and apoptotic signaling. The virus encodes four viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs) that block cellular IRF activities and target proteins that induce apoptosis. Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which HHV-8 inactivates a key pro-apoptotic protein called Bim. Bim is a negative regulator of HHV-8 replication, and its inactivation is crucial for the virus to replicate efficiently. The study found that vIRF-1, one of the viral interferon regulatory factors, directly interacts with Bim and relocates it to the nucleus, where it is inactivated. This interaction is essential for vIRF-1's pro-replication and anti-apoptotic activity. The researchers used various experiments, including immunofluorescence assays, western analysis, and co-precipitation assays, to demonstrate the direct interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim. They also showed that blocking this interaction with a cell-permeable peptide reduced vIRF-1's pro-replication activity. This study reveals a novel mechanism by which HHV-8 controls replication-induced apoptosis and suggests that targeting the interaction between vIRF-1 and Bim may provide an effective way to control HHV-8 replication. The findings have implications for the development of antiviral strategies against HHV-8, which is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and other diseases.
Researchers have discovered that a specific protein, αVβ6 integrin, plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response in the lungs. This protein, found on the surface of epithelial cells, helps to maintain a balance between immune readiness and immune activation. When the protein is upregulated during lung injury or infection, it helps to moderate the severity of the immune response. In a study using mice, researchers found that mice lacking the αVβ6 integrin (β6 KO mice) were protected from severe lung injury and improved survival rates during influenza infection. This was due to reduced viral spread into the alveolar spaces and lower levels of inflammatory cytokines. The researchers also found that β6 KO mice had altered lung macrophages, which were constitutively activated and produced high levels of type I interferon, a protein that helps to fight off viral infections. However, when these mice were treated with transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), a protein that is activated by αVβ6 integrin, their lung macrophages returned to a normal state and they were no longer protected from influenza infection. The study suggests that the loss of αVβ6 integrin leads to an altered lung microenvironment, resulting in reduced lung injury and improved survival rates during respiratory infections. The findings have implications for understanding the role of αVβ6 integrin in regulating the immune response in the lungs and may lead to the development of new treatments for respiratory infections.
Researchers in Argentina conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Leishmanin Skin Test (LST) in diagnosing American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis. The study analyzed data from 733 patients who visited a reference center in Argentina between 2006 and 2015. The results showed that the LST was a useful tool in diagnosing the disease, especially when used in combination with other diagnostic methods. The study found that the LST was positive in 65% of cases where the parasite was confirmed through a skin or mucosal lesion smear. In cases where the smear was negative, the LST was positive in 69 instances. The study also found that the LST was more effective in diagnosing lesions that were older than 21 days. The researchers concluded that the LST can be used as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis across all age groups, even in areas where the disease is common. The study suggests that standardizing the LST technique and further research into its use could improve the management of suspected cases. The findings of this study support the use of the LST as a valuable tool in the diagnosis of American Cutaneous Leishmaniasis, particularly in areas where the disease is endemic.
Researchers have identified a genetic mechanism that contributes to the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). They studied how exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) affects gene expression in human macrophages, which play a key role in the development of atherosclerosis. The team used a combination of techniques to map changes in chromatin structure and gene expression in macrophages before and after exposure to oxLDL. They found that oxLDL exposure altered the expression of 19 genes involved in lipid handling and foam cell formation, which is a key stage in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The researchers also identified a variant at the PPAP2B locus, rs72664324, which is associated with CAD risk. They found that this variant affects the binding of the transcription factor C/EBP-beta to the PPAP2B gene, leading to increased expression of the PPAP2B protein product LPP3. LPP3 is involved in the degradation of pro-inflammatory mediators, which are key players in the development of atherosclerosis. The study provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying CAD and highlights the importance of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic environmental stimuli. The findings suggest that understanding how oxLDL influences transcriptional regulation in macrophages could lead to new approaches to prevent or treat atherosclerosis.
Researchers in Malawi conducted a study to determine the effectiveness of a single round of azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) in reducing the prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) in districts with a TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9% in children aged 1-9 years. The World Health Organization recommends three rounds of MDA in districts with a TF prevalence of 10% or higher. However, this approach may not be practical due to the large number of endemic districts worldwide and the resources required to conduct surveys.

The Malawi Ministry of Health administered one round of azithromycin MDA to eight districts with baseline TF prevalences of 5.0-9.9%, achieving a mean coverage of approximately 80%. Population-based trachoma surveys were conducted in 18 evaluation units of the treated districts at least six months after the MDA. The results showed that all 18 evaluation units had a TF prevalence of less than 5.0%.

The study suggests that a single round of azithromycin MDA with high coverage can be effective in reducing TF prevalence to less than 5.0% in districts with a TF prevalence of 5.0-9.9%. This approach may be a more practical and cost-effective way to control trachoma in endemic districts. The study's findings provide optimism that Malawi may be able to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem by 2020.
Plants have a sophisticated immune system that helps them defend against pathogens without the need for specialized immune cells or an adaptive immune system. A key part of this system is a group of proteins called NLR (nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat) proteins, which act as sensors to detect the presence of pathogens. When an NLR protein recognizes a pathogen, it triggers a series of immune responses, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), programmed cell death (PCD), and changes in gene expression. However, the exact mechanisms behind these responses are not fully understood.

Researchers have identified six closely related calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) in Arabidopsis plants that play a crucial role in mediating these immune responses. These CPKs are activated by the NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1, and they control the onset of cell death and the production of ROS. The CPKs also phosphorylate specific transcription factors, called WRKY proteins, to regulate gene expression and restrict pathogen growth. Additionally, the CPKs phosphorylate NADPH oxidases, which produce ROS and contribute to PCD.

The study found that different CPKs have distinct substrate specificities and subcellular dynamics, suggesting that they play different roles in the immune response. The research provides new insights into the complex signaling mechanisms that occur downstream of NLR immune sensors and highlights the importance of calcium-dependent protein kinases in plant immunity.
Researchers in Mali used a statistical method called state-space forecasting to predict the spread of Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic disease that affects millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa. The study focused on the district of Niono, Mali, where the disease has a significant impact on public health. The researchers used historical data from 1996 to 2004 to create a model that could forecast the disease's spread over the next few months. They found that the model was reasonably accurate, with an error rate of around 25% for forecasts made 1-5 months in advance. The model also accounted for seasonal and annual fluctuations in the disease's spread, as well as the impact of external factors such as climate, irrigation, and public health interventions. This type of forecasting could be useful for public health programs in developing countries, which often struggle to manage and control the spread of parasitic diseases like Schistosoma haematobium. The researchers suggest that this method could be used to create early warning systems and improve the management of the disease in the district of Niono, Mali, and potentially in other parts of the Sahel region.
Researchers studied how human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interacts with host cells to infect them. They found that a viral protein called pp150 prevents the virus from replicating in cells that are in the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle. This is because pp150 binds to a protein called cyclin A, which is only present in S/G2 cells. When pp150 binds to cyclin A, it stops the virus from expressing its genes and replicating.

The researchers created a mutant virus that couldn't bind to cyclin A, allowing it to replicate in S/G2 cells. However, this led to a problem: the cells became stuck in the G2 phase and couldn't divide. The virus was able to replicate in these cells, but the cells died. The researchers also found that another viral protein, pUL21a, helps to keep the cells in the G2 phase by destabilizing cyclin A.

When both pp150 and pUL21a were unable to bind to cyclin A, the cells entered mitosis and the virus was severely impaired. This suggests that pp150 and pUL21a work together to keep the cells in the G2 phase, allowing the virus to replicate without killing the host cells. The researchers conclude that this mechanism is essential for productive HCMV infection.
Researchers investigated the genetic causes of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons and leads to paralysis and death. They used a targeted sequencing approach to analyze 169 known and candidate ALS genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 matched controls. The study found a significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in ALS cases compared to controls, suggesting that these variants may be linked to the disease.

The researchers used a combination of functional studies, bioinformatics tools, and rare variant analysis to assess the relevance of newly identified variants to ALS. They found that cases had a higher burden of deleterious mutations than controls, supporting the idea that novel or rare mutations in key genes may contribute to sporadic ALS.

The study identified new variants in known ALS disease genes, as well as in genes associated with ALS, and found no association between several previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ALS in their population, with the exception of APOE. The researchers also identified new variants in genes identified through their trio and RRM studies.

The study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing techniques combined with functional studies and rare variant analysis tools to provide insight into the genetic etiology of sporadic ALS. The results suggest that approximately 40% of sporadic ALS cases may have no identifiable genetic cause, and that further research is needed to distinguish true disease-causing variants from benign ones.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) in helping the immune system remember and fight off the influenza virus. IL-6 is a molecule that helps regulate the activity of T cells, which are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in fighting off infections. The study found that IL-6 is essential for the development of long-term memory in a specific type of T cell called CD4+ T cells, but not in another type of T cell called CD8+ T cells. This is important because CD4+ T cells are responsible for coordinating the immune response, while CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells. The researchers found that IL-6 limits the activity of regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are a type of immune cell that can suppress the activity of other immune cells, including CD4+ T cells. By limiting the activity of Tregs, IL-6 allows CD4+ T cells to function properly and help the body fight off the influenza virus. The study suggests that IL-6 plays a critical role in ensuring that the immune response is not suppressed by Tregs during an acute infection, which is necessary for the body to clear the virus and survive. Overall, the study highlights the importance of IL-6 in the development of long-term immunity to the influenza virus.
Researchers have discovered a new function of the enzyme enolase in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Enolase is typically known for its role in glycolysis, the process by which cells break down glucose for energy. However, the study found that enolase also interacts with a protein called Dnmt2, which is involved in the methylation of DNA and transfer RNA (tRNA). This interaction is significant because Dnmt2 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression, and its activity has been linked to various diseases, including cancer.

The researchers used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify enolase as a Dnmt2-binding protein. They found that enolase acts as an inhibitor of Dnmt2, and that this inhibitory activity is controlled by glucose metabolism. When glucose levels are low, enolase accumulates in the nucleus and binds to Dnmt2, reducing its activity. This reduction in Dnmt2 activity leads to a decrease in the methylation of tRNA, which is essential for protein synthesis.

The study also found that the interaction between enolase and Dnmt2 is conserved across different species, including humans and fruit flies. This suggests that the role of enolase in regulating Dnmt2 activity may be an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. The discovery of this new function of enolase has significant implications for our understanding of the regulation of gene expression and the role of Dnmt2 in disease.
Researchers have discovered microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes, specifically in the species Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, which are known to transmit diseases such as Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and were previously thought to be found only inside cells. However, circulating miRNAs have been detected in human serum and saliva. This study used next-generation sequencing to identify 103 miRNAs in mosquito saliva, 31 of which were previously unknown. The researchers found that some of these miRNAs are only present in mosquitoes infected with CHIKV, suggesting that they may play a role in the transmission and establishment of the virus in the host. The study also found that inhibiting these miRNAs decreased viral replication, indicating that they may enhance CHIKV replication and dissemination in the host. The discovery of miRNAs in mosquito saliva provides new insights into the mechanisms of mosquito-borne disease transmission and may lead to the development of new strategies for preventing or treating these diseases. This is the first report of exogenous miRNAs in mosquito saliva, and further research is needed to fully understand their role in disease transmission.
Researchers have investigated the role of three proteins, Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p, in repairing damage to the mitochondrial genome in yeast cells. Mitochondria have their own DNA, which is separate from the DNA in the cell's nucleus, and damage to this DNA can lead to a range of diseases and disorders. The study found that these three proteins, which are involved in a process called homologous recombination, play a crucial role in repairing breaks in the mitochondrial DNA. The researchers used a technique to introduce a break in the mitochondrial DNA in yeast cells and found that removing the Rad51p and Rad59p proteins significantly impaired the repair of this break.

The study also found that these proteins are localized to the matrix of the mitochondria, where they can interact with the mitochondrial DNA. The researchers used a reporter system to introduce a single break in the mitochondrial DNA and found that the loss of Rad51p, Rad52p, and Rad59p significantly decreased the rate of spontaneous deletions in the mitochondrial DNA. This suggests that these proteins play a key role in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondrial genome.

The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of mitochondrial DNA repair and highlights the importance of these proteins in maintaining the health of the mitochondria. The findings have implications for our understanding of diseases caused by mitochondrial DNA damage, such as certain cancers and neurological disorders. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of these proteins in mitochondrial DNA repair and to identify other factors that contribute to this process.
A systematic review examined the relationship between social determinants of health and the risk of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), and rheumatic heart disease (RHD). The review included 90 studies from 1,164 publications and found that 57.1% of studies reported a significant association between socioeconomic determinants and the risk of GAS infection, while 50% reported an association with ARF/RHD. Crowding was the most commonly assessed factor, with 14 studies linking it to GAS infection and 36 studies linking it to ARF/RHD. The majority of studies found a positive association between crowding, socioeconomic status, education, employment status, and nutrition with the risk of GAS infection, ARF, or RHD. The review found that crowding and socioeconomic status met the criteria for a causal association with GAS infection and ARF/RHD. However, the quality of the studies was generally poor, with 49 (50.5%) of the studies being of poor quality. The review highlights the need for high-quality studies to better understand the relationship between social determinants and the risk of GAS infection, ARF, and RHD. The findings suggest that addressing crowding and socioeconomic status could be a practical target for prevention actions to reduce the risk of these diseases.
Researchers studied the PhoQ/PhoP bacterial signaling network, a well-studied two-component system found in many bacteria. They found that a single point mutation in the PhoQ protein, which abolishes its phosphatase activity, results in a significant change in the network's behavior. The mutant protein responds to stimuli in a bistable manner, meaning it can exist in two distinct states: an "on" state and an "off" state. In contrast, the wild-type protein has a graded response to stimuli. The mutant cells in the "on" and "off" states have different morphologies, and their state is inherited over many generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the "on" state. Mathematical modeling and experiments suggest that the bistability depends on positive autoregulation of the two key proteins in the circuit, PhoP and PhoQ. The mutant's bistable behavior comes at a fitness cost, with the "on" state having a lower fitness than the "off" state in certain conditions. However, due to the high inheritance of the "on" state, a population of "on" cells can become epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state. The study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component signaling architecture and highlights the tradeoffs in the PhoQ/PhoP system.
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare but deadly infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. Current treatment options are limited and often ineffective, making it a significant public health concern. Researchers have turned to "drug repurposing," a cost-effective strategy that involves using existing medications to treat rare or neglected diseases. A potential target for PAM treatment is the enzyme CYP51, which is essential for the production of ergosterol, a critical component of the amoeba's cell membrane. CYP51 is also a target for antifungal medications, raising the possibility of repurposing these drugs to treat PAM. In this study, researchers investigated the effectiveness of antifungal azole drugs, known as conazoles, against N. fowleri. They found that these drugs disrupted the amoeba's sterol biosynthesis and reduced its viability. The researchers also identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate in N. fowleri and analyzed the interactions between the enzyme and conazoles. The results suggest that CYP51 is a viable target for PAM treatment and that conazole drugs, such as fluconazole and miconazole, may be effective against the amoeba. These findings provide a promising lead for the development of new treatments for PAM, a disease with a high mortality rate and limited treatment options.
Researchers studied the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4Rα) in the immune system's response to parasitic nematode infections. These parasites trigger a type 2 immune response, which is crucial for host protection. However, it was unclear whether IL-4Rα was necessary for maintaining this response after it had been established. To investigate, the researchers used a special mouse model where the IL-4Rα gene could be temporarily deleted. They found that sustained expression of IL-4Rα was necessary for maintaining type 2 immune responses and protecting against nematode infections. When IL-4Rα was deleted after the immune response had been established, the mice were unable to clear the parasites. Furthermore, deleting IL-4Rα before a secondary infection made it harder for the mice to recall the immune response and clear the parasites. This suggests that IL-4Rα plays a critical role in maintaining and recalling type 2 immune responses against nematode infections. The study reveals a new function for IL-4Rα beyond its role in initiating the immune response. The findings have implications for understanding how to develop effective treatments against parasitic nematode infections, which currently have no vaccine.
A global analysis of the distribution of Bartonella bacteria in mammals reveals that humans play a significant role in shaping the spread of this disease-causing genus. The study, which examined the largest collection of Bartonella gltA genotypes to date, found that rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. The research suggests that Bartonella likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. The study also found evidence of exchange of Bartonella between phylogenetically distant domestic animals and wildlife, likely due to increased contact.

The findings indicate that humans have altered the disease risk for themselves, their commensal animals, and wildlife by changing habitats and increasing contact between species. The study highlights the importance of considering a broad range of potential animal hosts and screening for a wide range of Bartonella genotypes when investigating the source of a suspected Bartonella infection. The research also emphasizes the need to avoid contact between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife to protect the health of all.

The study's findings have implications for understanding the impacts of humans on patterns of infectious disease spread within and between species, across landscapes, and across the globe. The research suggests that Bartonella is an ideal pathogen to focus on in tracing zoonotic potential and potential impacts on native hosts. The study's results provide new insights into the evolutionary history of Bartonella, patterns of host switching, and geographic constraints on its spillover into humans or from human commensals into wild species.
A long noncoding RNA called MALAT1 plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression. Research has shown that MALAT1 is overexpressed in cancer tissues and is associated with rapid cell growth. However, the underlying mechanism of how MALAT1 affects cell cycle progression was not well understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of MALAT1 in regulating cell cycle progression.

The study found that MALAT1 levels are regulated during normal cell cycle progression and that it modulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression. Depletion of MALAT1 led to the activation of p53, a tumor suppressor protein, and its target genes. The study also found that MALAT1-depleted cells displayed reduced expression of B-MYB, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in cell cycle progression, due to altered splicing of its pre-mRNA.

Further analysis revealed that MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation by regulating the expression and/or pre-mRNA processing of cell cycle-regulated transcription factors. The study suggests that abnormal expression of MALAT1 in specific cell types or tissues can lead to aberrant alternative splicing, resulting in the misexpression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and contributing to tumor progression. The findings provide new insights into the role of MALAT1 in regulating cellular proliferation and its potential involvement in cancer development.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating insect development, metamorphosis, and reproduction. In the migratory locust, JH promotes adult reproduction by stimulating DNA replication and increasing ploidy in preparation for vitellogenesis, the process of egg yolk production. Researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to block the action of the JH receptor, Methoprene-tolerant (Met), and found that this led to reduced DNA replication and polyploidy, as well as impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth.

The study identified two genes, Mcm4 and Mcm7, which are involved in DNA replication, as key targets of JH action. When JH is present, these genes are expressed, leading to increased DNA replication and polyploidy. Depletion of Mcm4 or Mcm7 using RNAi resulted in reduced vitellogenin mRNA levels and impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. The researchers also found that the JH receptor, Met, directly regulates the transcription of Mcm4 and Mcm7 by binding to specific DNA sequences.

These findings suggest that the JH-receptor complex acts on Mcm4 and Mcm7 to regulate DNA replication and polyploidy for vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation in the migratory locust. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying JH action in insect reproduction and highlights the importance of Mcm4 and Mcm7 in this process.
Researchers conducted a study to determine the optimal duration of prednisolone treatment for leprosy patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI). Leprosy patients with NFI of less than six months were randomly assigned to receive either a 20-week or 32-week course of prednisolone. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at 78 weeks. The study included 868 patients, with 429 in the 20-week arm and 439 in the 32-week arm. The results showed that the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ significantly between the two groups, with 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in the 32-week arm. Secondary outcomes, such as improvements in the Reaction Severity Scale, SALSA Scale, and Participation Scale, also did not show significant differences between the two groups. However, a higher proportion of patients in the 32-week arm experienced serious adverse events. The study found that a 20-week course of prednisolone was as effective as a 32-week course in improving and restoring recent clinical NFI in leprosy patients. Therefore, a 20-week course of prednisolone is recommended as the initial treatment duration for leprosy neuropathy, with only a minority of patients requiring further individualized treatment.
Researchers studied the vocalizations of male Rocky Mountain elk and European Red Deer to understand the relationship between sound complexity and anatomy. They created a computer model of the larynx and vocal tract based on the anatomy and biomechanics of the two species. The model allowed them to simulate the production of different types of calls, including the elk's high-pitched bugle and the red deer's low-pitched roar.

The study found that the elk's high-pitched bugle requires more muscular effort and lung pressure than the red deer's low-pitched roar. However, the elk's bugle is also more efficient in terms of converting aerodynamic energy into sound energy. This means that the elk can produce a louder sound with less energy expenditure. The researchers suggest that this efficiency advantage may be due to the lower airflow required for high-pitched sounds and an acoustic radiation advantage at higher frequencies.

The study also found that the two species use different types of calls to signal different physical qualities. The red deer's low-pitched roar is related to its overall body size, while the elk's high-pitched bugle may signal muscular strength and endurance. The researchers propose that the elk's high-pitched bugle is an "honest signal," meaning that it is an accurate indicator of the elk's physical abilities. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex relationship between sound production and anatomy in mammals.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, which is a technique used to map transcription-factor binding sites and chromatin modifications in the genome. The traditional method of analyzing ChIP-seq data relies on using only reads that map uniquely to a reference genome, known as uni-reads. However, this approach can lead to the omission of up to 30% of alignable reads.

The new approach, called multi-read analysis, allocates reads that map to multiple locations on the reference genome as fractional counts using a weighted alignment scheme. Using human STAT1 and mouse GATA1 ChIP-seq datasets, the researchers found that incorporating multi-reads significantly increases sequencing depths and leads to the detection of novel peaks that are not identifiable with uni-reads alone. These peaks are often located in highly repetitive regions of the genome, such as segmental duplications.

The researchers also validated a number of GATA1 multi-read only peaks using independent quantitative real-time ChIP analysis and identified novel target genes of GATA1. The study suggests that multi-reads can be critical for studying transcription factor binding in highly repetitive regions of genomes with ChIP-seq experiments. Overall, the incorporation of multi-reads can improve the detection of binding sites and increase the accuracy of ChIP-seq analysis.
Researchers estimated the economic benefits to individuals of achieving the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for four neglected tropical diseases (NTDs): human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmaniasis, and Chagas disease. These diseases are controlled or eliminated through innovative and intensified disease management (IDM). The study combined data on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these NTDs with projections of the number of people affected, country, and year for 2011-2020 and 2021-2030. The researchers compared an ideal scenario where the WHO's 2020 targets are met with a counterfactual scenario where the situation in 1990 remained unchanged. The economic benefit was calculated as the difference between the two scenarios.

The total global productivity gained for the four IDM-NTDs was estimated to be $23.1 billion in 2011-2020 and $35.9 billion in 2021-2030. The reduction in OPPs was estimated to be $14 billion in 2011-2020 and $18 billion in 2021-2030. The study found that the economic benefits of achieving the targets far exceed the necessary investments by endemic country governments and their development partners. The benefits are particularly significant for disadvantaged populations in low- and middle-income countries, who often bear the brunt of the health and economic consequences of NTDs.
A long-held assumption in neuroscience is that neurons with higher selectivity, or the ability to respond to a narrower range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external sensory inputs. However, a new study challenges this idea by showing that the amount of information encoded by a population of neurons in the auditory cortex is not determined by their selectivity, but rather by the total number of spikes they produce. In the auditory cortex, neurons initially respond to a wide range of sounds, but as the sound continues, their responses become more selective, responding to a narrower range of sounds. Despite this change in selectivity, the study found that the population of neurons conveys similar information about the sound input during both the initial and sustained response epochs. The researchers discovered that the amount of information encoded is almost entirely dependent on the total number of spikes produced by the population, rather than the selectivity of individual neurons. This finding suggests a new principle of sensory encoding that may be shared across multiple sensory systems. The study's results challenge the prevailing theory that neurons with higher selectivity provide more information about sensory input, and instead suggest that the total number of spikes produced by a population of neurons is a more important factor in determining the amount of information encoded.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called OX40 plays a crucial role in helping the immune system control persistent viral infections. In contrast to acute viral infections, where the immune system can clear the pathogen quickly, chronic viral infections require the immune system to maintain a strong response over a longer period to prevent the virus from spreading. A team of scientists investigated the role of OX40 in controlling a persistent viral infection caused by the LCMV (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus) clone 13. They found that mice lacking the OX40 receptor were unable to control the infection and produced fewer antibodies to fight the virus. The study showed that OX40 is essential for the long-term survival of T cells, which are a type of immune cell that plays a key role in fighting viral infections. The researchers also found that OX40 expression was stronger on CD4 T cells, but a subset of CD8 T cells also displayed sustained OX40 expression. The study highlights the importance of OX40 in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence and has implications for understanding T cell dysfunction in persistent viral infections in humans. The findings suggest that OX40 could be a potential target for developing new treatments for chronic viral infections.
Researchers have discovered a remarkable example of convergent evolution in aquatic animals, where a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three different phyla. This optimal method, known as the "optimal specific wavelength" (OSW), is characterized by a consistent ratio of undulation length to mean amplitude of undulations along the fin length, which is around 20. This ratio maximizes the force generated by the body, resulting in faster swimming speeds.

The OSW is observed in a diverse group of aquatic animals, including invertebrates like cuttlefish and vertebrates like cartilaginous and bony fish. The researchers hypothesize that the regulation of OSW, axial elongation, and fin elongation in these phyla may be influenced by common genetic networks, similar to those found in the case of the electric organ. This phenomenon unifies a wide range of swimming organisms, from slow-moving median/paired fin animals to fast-moving body/caudal fin swimmers like tuna and lamnid sharks.

The discovery of OSW provides a link between physical principles and biological phenomena, shedding light on why evolution converges to the same result or diverges to a wide variety of solutions. The researchers suggest that the slower forms of swimming exhibited by median/paired fin animals may emerge and thrive despite the prevalence of body/caudal fin swimming in ancestral species, possibly due to anatomical specializations that minimize trunk movement during tail fin movement.
Researchers studied the role of two protein complexes, condensins I and II, in the division of neural stem cells (NSCs) in mice. These cells are crucial for the development of the cerebral cortex and must divide symmetrically to proliferate and asymmetrically to generate neurons. The study found that both condensins I and II are essential for NSC divisions and survival, and their simultaneous depletion leads to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, causing DNA damage and triggering cell death. Individual depletions of condensins I and II result in slower loss of NSCs, but with distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation is more prominent in NSCs depleted of condensin II, while mitotic delays are detectable only in condensin I-depleted NSCs. Notably, NSCs depleted of condensin II display hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli, indicating that condensin II plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture. These defects are also observed in postmitotic neurons. The study demonstrates that condensins I and II have both overlapping and non-overlapping functions in NSCs, and provides evolutionary insight into the intricate balancing acts of the two condensin complexes.
Researchers studied the genetic and epigenetic changes that occur in the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni as it develops from a larval stage to an adult in its human host. The parasite has a unique reproductive system, where sex is determined by a female heterogametic system, but phenotypic differences between males and females only appear after infection of the host. To understand the molecular mechanisms behind this process, the researchers analyzed the parasite's transcriptome, or the complete set of its genes, at different stages of development and in both males and females. They found that 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between sexes in at least one developmental stage, and 4,065 of these genes were functionally annotated. The researchers also used a technique called ChIP-Seq to study the epigenetic changes, specifically the H3K27me3 histone modification, in the parasite's genome before and after the appearance of phenotypic sexual dimorphism. Their results suggest that sexual differentiation in S. mansoni is accompanied by distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes, genetic determinants, and epigenetic regulators. This study provides new insights into the parasite's reproductive function and host-parasite interaction, and could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a disease caused by S. mansoni.
Researchers have proposed a new approach to model disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts. The approach assigns a confidence value to each annotation, representing the probability that it is correct. This is achieved by estimating annotator-specific parameters from data and computing certainty levels for individual annotations. Two probabilistic models were developed and tested using computer simulations and a large dataset of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts. The models were also applied to a 1,000-sentence subset annotated by five new experts. The results show that even when all annotators disagree, the approach can significantly increase the probability of choosing the correct annotation. The proposed methodology is general and can be applied to most data annotation studies. A corpus of 10,000 sentences, annotated according to several dimensions, is made publicly available to facilitate further research. The study aims to improve existing curation approaches by providing a holistic approach to quantify certainty in individual annotations and retain the complete dataset for training and testing machine learning methods. The researchers suggest conducting small-scale annotation experiments to estimate error rates specific to the task and annotator experts, which can be used to assign confidence to data annotated by a single expert with a known correctness rate.
Researchers have developed a potential treatment for hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a deadly disease caused by Andes virus (ANDV) in South America. They used a DNA vaccine platform in geese to produce antibodies that can neutralize the virus. The geese were vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding the ANDV envelope glycoproteins and developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies. The antibodies, called IgY and IgYΔFc, were purified from the eggs of the vaccinated geese and shown to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of the ANDV envelope glycoproteins.

The researchers tested the protective efficacy of the goose-derived antibodies in a hamster model of lethal HPS. They passively transferred the antibodies to hamsters starting 5 days after an ANDV challenge and found that both the immune sera and purified IgY/IgYΔFc protected 8 of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters, respectively. In contrast, hamsters that received IgY/IgYΔFc purified from normal geese or no treatment developed lethal HPS.

These findings demonstrate that the DNA vaccine/goose platform can be used to produce a candidate antiviral biological product capable of preventing a lethal disease when administered post-exposure. This approach offers an alternative to using human convalescent sera or mammalian antibodies, which are in short supply or have risks of reactogenicity in humans. The researchers identified novel potentially neutralizing epitopes on the ANDV glycoproteins recognized by the IgY/IgYΔFc from the egg yolks of geese vaccinated with the ANDV DNA vaccine.
Research has shown that changes in DNA methylation patterns play a significant role in the development of human cancers. The Dnmt3a enzyme is crucial for establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dnmt3a have been linked to certain types of leukemia. In a mouse model of lung cancer, deleting Dnmt3a was found to promote tumor growth, suggesting that the enzyme may help prevent cancer by maintaining DNA methylation patterns.

     To better understand the role of Dnmt3a in cancer, researchers used a technique called whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to analyze DNA methylation patterns in mouse lung tumors with and without Dnmt3a. The results showed that tumors without Dnmt3a had a uniformly hypomethylated genome, while tumors with Dnmt3a had large hypomethylated domains that corresponded to areas near the nuclear lamina.

     Further analysis revealed that Dnmt3a is necessary for maintaining methylation in active chromosome domains, and that tumors without Dnmt3a showed moderate levels of gene deregulation in these areas. This suggests that Dnmt3a plays a critical role in preventing cancer by protecting these domains from hypomethylation. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of cancer development and the role of Dnmt3a in maintaining DNA methylation patterns.
Researchers studied the neural activity in the premotor cortex of songbirds to understand how they generate the complex sequences of sounds that make up their songs. They found that the activity of neurons in this region is not random, but rather follows a specific pattern. The researchers used a combination of techniques, including electrophysiology and calcium imaging, to record the activity of neurons in the premotor cortex of singing birds. They discovered that the activity of excitatory neurons, which send signals to other neurons, is correlated with a specific phase of a 30 Hz network rhythm. This rhythm is coherent over a length scale of about 100 micrometers, and is influenced by the activity of inhibitory neurons, which help to regulate the activity of excitatory neurons. The researchers also found that the activity of projection neurons, which send signals to other parts of the brain, is sparse and correlated in time with the activity of neighboring neurons. These findings suggest that the premotor cortex of songbirds is organized in a specific way, with excitatory and inhibitory neurons working together to generate the complex sequences of sounds that make up their songs. The researchers propose that this type of organization may be a common feature of cortical motor microcircuits in other species, and could be important for the sequential organization of behavior.
Researchers have identified 64 genes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that, when inactivated after development, extend the animal's lifespan. These genes are highly conserved across evolution, from yeast to humans, and are essential for growth and development. Many of these genes are involved in insulin and metabolic pathways, but also in translation, RNA, and chromatin regulation. Inactivating these genes early in development causes growth arrest at the larval stage, and some of these arrested animals live longer than wild-type adults. The gene daf-16 is required for the enhanced survival of arrested larvae, suggesting that the increased longevity is a physiological response to the essential gene inactivation. This study suggests that insulin-signaling pathways play a role in regulating aging at any stage of life. The findings also highlight the importance of separating developmental and aging phenotypes when studying essential genes. The researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to inactivate 2,700 genes essential for C. elegans development and identified the 64 genes that extended lifespan when inactivated post-developmentally. The study provides new insights into the regulation of aging and the role of insulin-signaling pathways in this process.
Scientists have discovered a crucial step in the process of regenerating lost body parts in zebrafish. When a zebrafish fin is amputated, a specialized layer of skin cells, called the epidermis, forms over the wound. This epidermis is essential for guiding the growth of new tissue from the underlying stump. Researchers identified a protein called laminin beta 1a (lamb1a) as a key player in this process. They found that lamb1a is sharply induced in a subset of skin cells after fin amputation and is required to establish and maintain a polarized layer of skin cells. This polarization is critical for the localization of signaling receptors, the expression of key growth factors, and the patterning of new bone cells. The researchers also discovered that the growth factor Fgf20a induces lamb1a expression during fin regeneration. Without lamb1a, the epidermis fails to form properly, and fin regeneration is impaired. The study suggests that the regeneration epidermis is shaped by a network of growth factor-extracellular matrix interactions. The findings provide new insights into the complex processes involved in regenerating lost body parts and may have implications for understanding human tissue repair and regeneration.
Researchers compared different methods for accounting for relatedness in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) using family-based data. They tested six linear mixed model (LMM) approaches, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM, on a study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families. The LMM methods were compared to traditional family-based association tests and alternative approaches implemented in software packages MQLS, ROADTRIPS, and MASTOR.

The study found strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all were successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches when applied to longitudinal data with many repeated measures. The LMM methods also showed high correlation with alternative approaches, except for transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects.

The researchers concluded that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches and are a convenient and robust method for family-based GWAS of quantitative or binary traits. The choice of LMM implementation should be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use, rather than power or type I error considerations. The study used real and simulated data from a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families to compare the performance of the different LMM and alternative approaches.
Researchers have identified three new compounds, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, that show promise in fighting Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. Current treatments for the acute stage of the disease have toxic side effects and are not always effective, and there is no treatment available for the chronic stage. The researchers developed a high-throughput screening method to test a library of 2,000 compounds for their ability to inhibit T. cruzi infection in mammalian cells. Three compounds stood out for their high activity against T. cruzi and low toxicity to host cells. Each of these compounds has a different mechanism of action, with CX1 showing strong trypanocidal activity, NT1 having a trypanostatic effect, and PCH1 affecting parasite division. These compounds also showed activity against T. cruzi from a different strain and against related parasites, Leishmania major and L. amazonensis. Further analysis of related compounds led to the identification of two even more potent molecules, PCH6 and CX2, with IC50 values 100 times lower than current treatments. These findings provide new leads for the development of treatments against Chagas disease and leishmaniasis. The next step is to test the toxicity and efficacy of these compounds in animals to assess their potential as therapeutic agents.
Researchers have developed a portable and cost-effective diagnostic platform for detecting Brugia parasites in mosquitoes, which are vectors of lymphatic filariasis. The platform, called "Backpack PCR," combines a rapid DNA extraction method using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with a portable, battery-powered PCR (polymerase chain reaction) device and a test strip-based DNA detection assay. This approach eliminates the need for expensive and bulky laboratory equipment, making it suitable for use in resource-limited settings.

The researchers evaluated the performance of the Backpack PCR platform by comparing it to standard silica column-based DNA extraction techniques and real-time PCR. They found that the NaOH-based DNA extraction method was as effective as the standard method, and the test strip-based detection assay was as sensitive and specific as real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis.

The Backpack PCR platform has the potential to greatly expand the reach of molecular xenomonitoring (MX) efforts, which are critical for controlling lymphatic filariasis. The platform is compact enough to fit into a small backpack, making it ideal for use in the field. The researchers believe that this platform could also be adapted for the detection of other mosquito-borne pathogens, such as those causing malaria, Zika, and dengue fever.

The development of a similar platform for detecting Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasite responsible for 90% of the global lymphatic filariasis burden, is currently underway. The Backpack PCR platform has the potential to increase the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring in areas where laboratory infrastructure is limited, ultimately contributing to the control and elimination of lymphatic filariasis.
Researchers have studied the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins, which have evolved independently multiple times in nature. These proteins are composed of alternating domains of elastomeric and cross-linking elements. The elastomeric domains provide elasticity and drive the assembly process, while the cross-linking domains stabilize the polymer. Changes in the number and arrangement of these domains can significantly impact the assembly and mechanical properties of the protein.

A theoretical study used a novel simulation environment to examine the impact of domain architecture on polymer assembly and integrity. The simulation used a model of diffusion-limited aggregation to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with alternating domain architectures. The results showed that the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-linking domains can significantly impact the morphology and structural integrity of the resultant polymeric structure.

The study found that the most highly connected polymers were those constructed from asymmetric rods consisting of relatively large cross-linking elements interspersed with smaller elastomeric domains. The simulations provide insights into the evolution of elastomeric proteins and may be useful for designing new biomaterials with tunable properties. The study's findings can help guide the rational design of novel elastomeric-peptides and provide a better understanding of the molecular basis for the evolution of elastomeric proteins.
Researchers have investigated the role of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in the Ebola virus (EBOV) genome. They found that the 5'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of EBOV mRNAs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESes), but instead regulate cap-dependent translation. The team discovered that the 5'-UTR of the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppresses translation of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene compared to a β-actin 5'-UTR. Furthermore, they found that the L 5'-UTR contains an upstream AUG (uAUG) that is sufficient to initiate translation and is surrounded by a "weak" Kozak sequence. The presence of this uAUG suppresses translation of the primary open reading frame (pORF) in a position-dependent manner. The researchers also found that the uAUG maintains translation of the L pORF under conditions where eIF2α is phosphorylated, indicating that the uORF modulates L translation in response to cellular stress. To investigate the role of the L uAUG in virus replication, the team generated a recombinant EBOV with the L uAUG mutated to UCG. They found that this mutation attenuated virus growth to titers 10-100-fold lower than a wild-type virus in Vero and A549 cells. The mutant virus also exhibited decreased viral RNA synthesis and enhanced sensitivity to the stress inducer thapsigargin. These findings identify novel mechanisms by which EBOV regulates its polymerase expression and suggest that targeting the L uAUG may be a potential therapeutic strategy.
Researchers have developed a new method to precisely map DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes. They found that these breaks are not randomly distributed, but instead occur in specific hotspots scattered along chromosomes. These hotspots delimit large DNA domains, 50-250 kilobases in size, which are protected from further fragmentation. About 30% of these domains, called "forum domains," contain clusters of genes that are coordinately expressed, meaning they are turned on or off together.

The researchers also discovered that two proteins, PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1, specifically bind to the ends of these forum domains. PARP1 is involved in chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation, while HNRNPA2B1 is a nuclear RNA processing factor. The binding of these proteins at the ends of forum domains may influence the coordinated expression of the genes within these domains.

The study suggests a novel type of gene regulation, where the presence of DSB hotspots and the binding of PARP1 and HNRNPA2B1 at the ends of forum domains can lead to the coordinated silencing or activation of gene clusters. This finding has implications for our understanding of human chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for cancer genomics and gene therapy. The researchers believe that their technique can be used to study fragile chromosomal sites in many types of human cells, and that further study of the role of HNRNPA2B1 in chromosomal domains is warranted.
Researchers studied trypanosomatids, a type of parasite, in bats from two areas in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The areas had different levels of preservation, with one being more degraded than the other. The study found that the level of preservation did not affect the diversity of bat species, with 15 and 14 species found in each area. However, two common fruit-eating bat species, Carollia perspicillata and Artibeus lituratus, were more abundant in the more preserved area.

The researchers detected trypanosomatid infections in 13% of the 181 bat specimens analyzed, with Trypanosoma dionisii being the most common parasite. Other parasites, including Trypanosoma cruzi DTUs TcI and TcIV, were also found. These parasites are known to cause Chagas disease in humans. The researchers also discovered a new parasite, Crithidia mellificae, which is typically found in insects, infecting a vertebrate host for the first time in the Americas.

The study suggests that bats are resilient to trypanosomatid infections and can maintain a high diversity of these parasites. The researchers found that bats from the more preserved area had slightly higher infection rates than those from the more degraded area. The study highlights the importance of understanding the diversity of trypanosomatids in bats, particularly in areas with high human population density, such as the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro. The findings also emphasize the need to discuss the concepts of parasitism and host-parasite relationships among trypanosomatids.
Ticks, specifically the Ixodes ricinus species, are the most common arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe. These ticks can transmit a wide range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. Research has shown that ticks can be co-infected with multiple pathogens, increasing the likelihood of co-transmission to humans or animals. However, there is a lack of data on co-infection prevalence and interactions between pathogens and symbionts in ticks.

A recent study analyzed 267 Ixodes ricinus female specimens collected in the French Ardennes and found that 45% were co-infected with up to five different pathogens. When including symbionts, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism, and up to eight microorganisms were identified in the same tick. The study also found a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelii, two pathogens that cause Lyme disease.

The study used high-throughput real-time PCR to detect 37 pathogens and four symbionts in the ticks. The results showed that half of the infected ticks were co-infected with at least two pathogens, highlighting the potential for co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals. The study also found high prevalence rates of symbionts co-existing with pathogens, suggesting that these symbionts may play a role in pathogen transmission and vector competence. The findings of this study raise questions about the consequences of co-infection on human and animal health and highlight the need for further research on the interactions between pathogens and symbionts in ticks.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how hematopoietic stem cells decide which lineage to commit to, specifically the erythroid-myeloid lineage. This decision is governed by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1, which are turned on and off in a switch-like manner. However, before commitment, these genes are primed at low expression levels, allowing for rapid deployment of transcription factors to implement specific genetic programs.

The researchers found that dynamical models based on known interactions between PU.1 and GATA-1, such as mutual antagonism and autoregulation, fail to make the system bistable, a feature necessary for robust lineage determination. To address this, they proposed a new mechanism involving a cofactor that is regulated and recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner, necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior.

The PU.1-GATA-1 switch also interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which inherits the state of its upstream master genes and reinforces the decision through feedback loops, leading to irreversible commitment. This genetic switch is an example of a network that implements both a primed and a committed state by regulating cooperativity through the recruitment of cofactors. The researchers suggest that perturbing the feedback between master regulators and downstream targets could lead to reprogramming strategies, and their approach could aid in the search for lineage-determining genes.
Researchers have identified a key component of the enterococcal polysaccharide antigen (EPA) that plays a crucial role in the virulence of the opportunistic pathogen Enterococcus faecalis. The study found that the decoration of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is essential for the bacterium's resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system. Lysozyme is an enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls, and E. faecalis's high resistance to it is due to a complex network of genes that work together to inhibit the enzyme's activity.

The researchers used random transposon mutagenesis to identify genes that contribute to lysozyme resistance in E. faecalis. They found that several genes, including oatA, pgdA, dltA, and sigV, are involved in the decoration of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide. Deletion of these genes significantly reduced the bacterium's resistance to lysozyme. Further analysis revealed that the decoration of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide is essential for the bacterium's virulence, as it confers resistance to phagocytosis in a zebrafish model of infection.

The study suggests that the production of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is not sufficient to promote E. faecalis infections, and that the modification of this surface polymer is essential for the bacterium's pathogenesis. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of E. faecalis virulence and highlight the importance of the EPA rhamnopolysaccharide decoration in its resistance to the innate immune system.
Researchers have developed a new model called RACER (Regression Analysis of Combined Expression Regulation) to better understand how genes are regulated in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This model combines data from two large databases: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). TCGA provides information on gene expression, copy number variation, DNA methylation, and microRNA expression in AML samples, while ENCODE offers data on transcription factor (TF) binding in a generic cell line.

RACER uses a two-stage regression framework to integrate these data. First, it infers the regulatory activities of TFs and microRNAs in each sample. Then, it uses these activities to predict the interactions between TFs, microRNAs, and genes. This approach overcomes a common challenge in integrating data from different sources.

The researchers tested RACER on AML data from TCGA and TF binding data from ENCODE. They used 10-fold cross-validation to verify the model's accuracy in predicting gene expression. They also evaluated RACER's ability to recover known regulatory interactions and compared its performance to existing methods. The results showed that RACER outperformed other methods in detecting known microRNA/TF targets.

RACER also identified 18 regulators whose activities were consistent with cytogenetic risk groups in AML. One of these regulators, miR-548p, was found to target genes involved in leukemia-related pathways, suggesting a novel role in AML pathogenesis. Additionally, the model identified C-Fos as a potential AML prognostic marker. Overall, RACER provides a new framework for integrating TCGA and ENCODE data to reveal AML-specific regulatory programs at a global level.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA silencing in the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum higginsianum, which causes disease in various crops worldwide. They created mutant strains lacking specific genes involved in RNA silencing, such as Dicer-like (DCL) and Argonaute (AGO) proteins, and analyzed their effects on the fungus's growth, conidiation, and small RNA populations. The results showed that mutants lacking DCL1 and AGO1 had severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology, while mutants lacking RDR (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) proteins had no noticeable effects on growth or conidiation.

Further analysis revealed that a previously unknown dsRNA virus, Colletotrichum higginsianum non-segmented dsRNA virus 1 (ChNRV1), was derepressed in the Δdcl1, Δdcl1Δdcl2, and Δago1 strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ChNRV1 is closely related to members of the segmented Partitiviridae family, despite its non-segmented genome. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO1 revealed abundant loading of 5'U-containing viral siRNA.

The study suggests that RNA silencing involving ChDCL1 and ChAGO1 in C. higginsianum functions as an antiviral mechanism to maintain low levels of ChNRV1 accumulation. The results also indicate that DCL1 and AGO1 are critical for conidia production and asexual spore morphology in C. higginsianum. Overall, this study provides new insights into the role of RNA silencing in the fungal pathogen C. higginsianum and its interaction with a novel dsRNA virus.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called MOF in the development of sperm cells in mice. They found that MOF is involved in three stages of a process called meiotic prophase I, which is crucial for the formation of sperm cells. During this process, a protein called H2AX is phosphorylated, which helps to mark and silence unsynapsed chromosomes. The researchers discovered that MOF is necessary for the expansion of H2AX phosphorylation to chromatin-wide regions in all three stages of meiotic prophase I. Without MOF, the expansion of H2AX phosphorylation was lost, leading to defects in the formation of sperm cells. Specifically, the researchers found that MOF is required for the expansion of H2AX phosphorylation in leptotene and zygotene spermatocytes, but not for its initiation. In pachytene spermatocytes, MOF is necessary for the third wave of H2AX phosphorylation expansion, which marks and silences unsynapsed chromosomes. The researchers also found that MOF is involved in the repair of double-strand breaks in DNA, which is essential for the proper formation of sperm cells. Overall, the study suggests that MOF plays a critical role in the development of sperm cells and that its dysfunction can lead to defects in spermatogenesis.
Researchers studied how the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) affects the development of immune cells called T-cells. They used a special mouse model that mimics the human immune system to see how HTLV-1 infection impacts T-cell development. The study found that HTLV-1 infection alters the normal development of T-cells in the thymus, a gland where T-cells mature. In mice infected with HTLV-1, the researchers observed an increase in mature T-cells and a decrease in immature T-cells. This suggests that HTLV-1 infection "pushes" the development of T-cells towards the mature stage, rather than allowing them to develop normally. The study also found that the more HTLV-1 virus present in the mice, the more severe the disruption of T-cell development. Additionally, the researchers found that HTLV-1 infection leads to the activation of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation, which can contribute to the development of cancer. The study provides evidence that HTLV-1 infection can lead to the development of T-cell malignancies, such as leukemia and lymphoma. The findings suggest that the mouse model used in this study can be a useful tool for understanding the mechanisms of HTLV-1-induced cancer and for testing potential treatments.
Researchers in Sudan conducted an integrated control project to reduce urogenital schistosomiasis in the Al Jabalain locality of White Nile State from 2009 to 2011. The project targeted 78,615 primary school students and a total population of 482,902. The study found that the prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium infection decreased from 28.5% at baseline to 13.5% after 6-9 months post-treatment. The reduction in prevalence was higher among girls, those with moderately infected status, and residents in rural areas compared to boys, those with high prevalence, and residents in urban areas. The project also showed that health education increased awareness about schistosomiasis among students, and the construction of a drinking water facility at Al Hidaib village led to a greater reduction in infection rates compared to a neighboring village. However, the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni infection did not change significantly between baseline and follow-up surveys. Approximately 200,000 people received either praziquantel therapy, health education, or clean water supply as part of the project. The study suggests that the integrated intervention should be continued to consolidate the achieved results. The project was part of a comprehensive schistosomiasis control program implemented by the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA) in White Nile State, Sudan.
Researchers have discovered a crucial step in the life cycle of the Nipah virus, a highly pathogenic emerging virus that causes fatal encephalitis in humans. They found that the virus's matrix protein, which plays a key role in viral assembly and budding, travels from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and then to the plasma membrane. This nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking is essential for the virus to bud and replicate. The researchers identified a specific lysine residue in the matrix protein that serves as a signal for nuclear import and regulates its export from the nucleus. They also found that the protein is modified by a process called monoubiquitination, which is necessary for its export from the nucleus and subsequent viral budding. Inhibiting this process with proteasome inhibitors, such as bortezomib, a medication used to treat multiple myeloma, blocked viral budding and reduced viral titers. This discovery opens up the possibility of using bortezomib as a therapeutic against Nipah virus infection. The study provides new insights into the life cycle of the Nipah virus and highlights the importance of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking in viral replication and budding.
Scientists have long sought to understand how viruses, particularly nonenveloped viruses, deliver their genetic material into host cells. A new study has made significant progress in this area by using a combination of imaging and biochemical assays to track the entry of poliovirus (PV) into live cells. The researchers found that PV binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters the cell through an endocytic mechanism that is independent of clathrin, caveolin, and flotillin, but dependent on actin and tyrosine kinase. Once inside the cell, the viral genome is released quickly, within 100-200 nanometers of the plasma membrane, from vesicles or tightly sealed membrane invaginations. This process is efficient and rapid, and does not limit the overall infectivity of the virus. The study's findings settle a long-standing debate about whether PV directly breaks the plasma membrane barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. The research provides new insights into the entry mechanisms of nonenveloped viruses and has implications for the development of antiviral therapies. The study's imaging assay is expected to be broadly applicable to the investigation of entry mechanisms for other nonenveloped viruses, including rhinoviruses, coxsackieviruses, echoviruses, and enteroviruses.
In rural Cambodia, dengue fever remains a significant public health concern, particularly among children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDCP) relies heavily on health education to prevent and control the disease. However, a study conducted in eastern Cambodia in 2003-2004 found that community and school-based health education for dengue control is insufficient, under-funded, and irregular. Community health education is provided through outreach activities and campaigns, but lacks systematic evaluation and follow-up. School-based education is restricted in terms of time and lacks practical activities for prevention and control. As a result, adherence to dengue prevention and control measures is partial.

The study suggests that sustained routine education is necessary for effective dengue prevention and control. It also highlights the need for approaches that ensure the translation of knowledge into practice. Economic, political, and infrastructural factors complicate the efficacy of health education in resource-poor countries like Cambodia. Local prevention and control activities, involving community members and supported through health education, offer potential to reduce dengue prevalence. However, these efforts are hindered by poorly resourced and episodic health education. The study recommends redefining existing dengue health education messages, materials, and strategies to be more practical, applicable, and relevant. It also emphasizes the need for training in health education techniques for health practitioners to improve their skills and perception of health education as an essential part of their work.
Researchers have made a significant discovery in the fight against filarial infections, which cause debilitating diseases in humans and animals. They found that filarial nematodes, the parasites responsible for these diseases, release small molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) into the bloodstream of their hosts. Using advanced technology, the researchers identified over 200 miRNA sequences in the blood of dogs infected with Dirofilaria immitis, a type of heartworm, and 21 miRNA sequences in the blood of humans infected with Onchocerca volvulus, a parasite that causes river blindness.

The researchers developed a test to detect these miRNAs in the blood, which can help diagnose filarial infections. The test was able to distinguish between infected and uninfected samples, but the number of miRNAs present did not directly correlate with the severity of the infection. This may be due to the imprecision of current methods for measuring the number of parasites in the blood.

The study also found that miRNAs from filarial nematodes can be detected in the blood even when the parasites do not live in the bloodstream, such as in the case of Onchocerca volvulus. This suggests that miRNAs could be a useful tool for diagnosing filarial infections, even in cases where the parasites are not directly present in the blood. Further research is needed to fully understand the potential of miRNAs as a diagnostic tool for filarial infections.
Researchers have studied the process of Src kinase activation, a crucial step in cellular signaling. Src kinases are large enzymes that undergo significant structural changes when switching from an inactive to an active state. To understand this process, scientists created a simplified model of the kinase's catalytic domain, using experimental structures of the inactive and active states. They then simulated the dynamic changes that occur during activation.

The simulations revealed two main pathways for activation. In the first pathway, a coordinated switch occurs among the αC helix, activation-loop, and β strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. In the second pathway, the conformational change is linked to a partial unfolding of the N-lobe region. The researchers also examined the switching mechanism of the αC helix and activation-loop in detail.

To test the accuracy of their model, the scientists used a Markov model, which accounts for the structural kinetics of Src conformational changes. The results provide a framework for understanding the main features of Src activation, including the large-scale motions that occur on a relatively slow timescale. These findings can help researchers better comprehend the complex process of Src kinase activation and its role in cellular signaling.
Researchers have identified a key gene, TTG2, that plays a crucial role in the lethality of offspring from crosses between plants with different numbers of chromosomes. This phenomenon, known as interploidy lethality, is a barrier to speciation in plants. The study focused on Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant commonly used in scientific research. By analyzing the genetic variation in interploidy crosses, the researchers found a single large-effect gene, DSL1, which was linked to the TTG2 gene. They discovered that the TTG2 gene, when expressed in the mother plant, affects the rate of postzygotic lethality in the offspring.

Further investigation revealed that loss-of-function mutations in TTG2 suppressed the F1 lethality caused by paternal excess interploidy crosses. The researchers also found that the frequency of cellularization in the endosperm, a critical process in seed development, was affected by both natural variation and TTG2 loss-of-function mutants. This suggests that the developmental programming of the mother plant regulates the viability of interploidy hybrid offspring. The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying interploidy lethality and its role in plant speciation. The discovery of a single gene, TTG2, that can mediate reproductive isolation by ploidy and fertility restoration highlights the potential for rapid evolution of F1 lethality in polyploids.
Researchers studied the co-evolution of bacteria and their mammal hosts, focusing on Bartonella and Leptospira in bats and rodents. They analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptospira from 20 bats. The study found significant co-evolutionary congruence between Bartonella and both their rodent and bat hosts at a global level. This means that the bacteria and their hosts have evolved together over time, with minimal host switching. In contrast, the relationship between Leptospira and their bat hosts was non-significant, indicating a lack of co-evolutionary congruence. Event-based cophylogeny analyses revealed that Leptospira had the greatest number of host switches per parasite, while Bartonella had the fewest. The study suggests that differences in disease-specific transmission and host ecology may be responsible for these variable co-evolutionary patterns. The findings have implications for predicting spillover between mammal reservoirs and ultimately to humans.
Researchers have developed a new framework to understand how undulatory swimmers, such as fish and eels, move through the water. This framework, called the forced damped oscillation framework, helps explain how muscle contractions and fluid forces work together to create the complex movements seen in these animals. By applying this framework to a chain-link model of undulatory swimming, scientists were able to show that relatively simple muscle contractions can lead to seemingly complex movements. The study found that the frequency of muscle contractions relative to the natural frequency of the swimmer's body is crucial in determining the type of movement that occurs. The researchers also discovered that the power generated by muscle contractions is used to create body deformations, which are then dissipated into the surrounding fluid, ultimately propelling the swimmer forward. A closed-form expression for swimming velocity was derived from the equations of motion, providing a quantitative understanding of the relationship between muscle contractions and movement. The study's findings also shed light on why typical swimming motions involve lower deformation modes and how power is transferred during the swimming cycle. The results were confirmed through computational fluid dynamics simulations, providing a unified understanding of both active (muscle-driven) and passive (fluid-driven) swimming. This new framework offers insights into the optimal deformation kinematics for fast swimming and provides a foundation for further research into the biomechanics of undulatory swimming.
Researchers have found that genetic recombination between human and animal parasites can create new strains of the human pathogen Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (Tbr), which causes sleeping sickness or human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in East Africa. This parasite is morphologically indistinguishable from its non-human infective subspecies, T. b. brucei (Tbb), which infects animals. A single gene, SRA, is responsible for the human infectivity of Tbr, and it can be transferred to Tbb through sexual reproduction, creating new strains of the human pathogen. The study used genetically engineered fluorescent parental trypanosome lines to track the inheritance of SRA in crosses between Tbr and Tbb. The results showed that SRA was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds, creating new strains of Tbr with no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility. The study also found that SRA exists as a single copy in most Tbr strains, but some Ugandan isolates had SRA on both homologues of chromosome IV. The mobility of SRA by genetic recombination explains the observed genetic variability of Tbr in East Africa. The study concludes that new strains of the human pathogen Tbr are being generated continuously by recombination with the larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes, posing a risk for future outbreaks of HAT.
Researchers have discovered a potential new approach to treating neonatal diabetes mellitus (NDM), a rare form of diabetes that affects infants and young children. NDM is caused by mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, which disrupt the normal functioning of beta cells in the pancreas. These cells are responsible for producing insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels.

The study found that gap junction coupling, which allows beta cells to communicate with each other, plays a significant role in suppressing insulin secretion in the presence of these mutations. By reducing gap junction coupling, researchers were able to recover normal insulin secretion and calcium levels in beta cells. This was achieved through a computational model that simulated the behavior of beta cells and was validated by experimental measurements.

The study suggests that reducing gap junction coupling may be a viable treatment option for NDM and other forms of diabetes caused by KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of considering the role of stochastic noise, or random fluctuations, in the functioning of beta cells. The study's findings provide new insights into the complex interactions between beta cells and may lead to the development of more effective treatments for NDM and other forms of diabetes.
Researchers have developed a framework to predict the behavior of complex gene transcription networks by accounting for a phenomenon called retroactivity. Retroactivity occurs when the dynamic performance of a module is influenced by its connections to other modules in the network. The framework uses three retroactivity matrices - internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity - to quantify the effects of intramodular and intermodular connections on a module's dynamics. These matrices can be computed from macroscopic parameters, such as dissociation constants and promoter concentrations, and the modules' topology.

The internal retroactivity matrix quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on an isolated module's dynamics, while the scaling and mixing retroactivity matrices establish how intermodular connections change the dynamics of connected modules. By using these matrices and the dynamics of modules in isolation, the framework can accurately predict how loading will affect the behavior of an arbitrary interconnection of modules.

The researchers applied this framework to various recurrent network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, the toggle switch, and the single-input motif. They also developed a quantitative metric to determine how robust the dynamic behavior of a module is to interconnection with other modules. This metric can be used to evaluate the extent of modularity in natural networks and to establish design guidelines to minimize retroactivity between modules in synthetic systems.
Researchers studied the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) of the human X and Y chromosomes, a region essential for proper chromosome separation during male meiosis. They found that PAR1 has an unusually high rate of genetic recombination, 17 times higher than the rest of the genome. To understand how this occurs, they created a detailed genetic map of recombination events in PAR1 using data from African-American families. They also analyzed recombination rates in human populations and identified direct binding sites of the protein PRDM9, which is known to regulate recombination in other parts of the genome. Contrary to previous findings in mice, the researchers found that PRDM9 does play a role in localizing recombination hotspots in human PAR1. They also discovered that recombination in PAR1 drives sequence evolution at a much faster rate than in other parts of the genome. Furthermore, they found that recombination hotspots in PAR1 vary significantly among human populations and have changed between humans and chimpanzees. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of recombination in PAR1 and highlight the importance of this region in human meiosis. The researchers believe that their genetic maps will aid future research on this critical region of the genome.
Researchers have identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2A, called ΔN-JMJD2A, which plays a crucial role in the process of skeletal muscle differentiation. This process involves the transformation of muscle precursor cells, called myoblasts, into mature muscle cells, called myotubes. The researchers found that ΔN-JMJD2A is specifically upregulated during this process and is necessary for the formation of myotubes and the expression of muscle-specific genes.

The study used a mouse myoblast cell line, C2C12, to investigate the role of ΔN-JMJD2A in muscle differentiation. The results showed that ΔN-JMJD2A is essential for the demethylation of histone H3K9 at the promoter of the myogenic factor myogenin (Myog), a key gene involved in muscle differentiation. This demethylation is necessary for the activation of Myog expression and the initiation of muscle-specific gene expression.

Further analysis revealed that ΔN-JMJD2A acts as a transcriptional co-activator for many genes involved in skeletal muscle differentiation. It binds directly to the Myog promoter to regulate H3K9 methylation, allowing Myog expression and promoting myotube differentiation. The study suggests that the induction of ΔN-JMJD2A is crucial for muscle differentiation, as it directs the removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter, promoting transcriptional activation of the Myog gene.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 reported cases in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of the absence of transmission in all countries. Researchers analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP in the end game, when the number of cases is low and the cost per case is high. They estimated the cost of the implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages from 1986 to 2030 and compared it to two alternative scenarios: doing nothing and control (surveillance and outbreak response). The GWEP cost an estimated $11 (95% uncertainty interval, $4.70-$12.49) per case averted in the period 1986-2030. The cost per Disability-Adjusted Life Year (DALY) averted by the GWEP relative to doing nothing is estimated at $222 (118-372) in 1986-2030. The GWEP is likely more cost-effective than control by 2030 and is certainly more cost-effective if the willingness to pay for one year of life lived without the risk of Guinea worm disease exceeds $0.10. Even if economic costs are twice as high as the financial costs estimated for the period to 2020, the GWEP will still be cost-effective relative to doing nothing.
Researchers studied the protein BBK32 from the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, to understand how it evades the human immune system. They found that the carboxy-terminal domain of BBK32, called BBK32-C, binds to and inhibits the C1r protein, a key component of the classical complement pathway. This pathway is a part of the immune system that helps fight off infections. The researchers also studied two other similar proteins, BAD16 from B. afzelii and BGD19 from B. garinii, and found that they have similar activities to BBK32-C, but with some differences. They used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of BBK32-C and found that it has a specific shape that allows it to bind to C1r. They also found that the three amino acids that are different between BBK32 and BGD19 are located on the surface of BBK32-C and may be important for its ability to bind to C1r. The researchers created a chimeric protein that mimicked the properties of BGD19 and found that it had reduced activity compared to BBK32-C. These findings provide new insights into how Lyme disease bacteria evade the human immune system and may lead to the development of new treatments for the disease.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, undergoes a transformation from commensalism to pathogenicity, involving changes in morphology and gene expression. While previous studies have identified factors involved in this transformation, the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. Researchers investigated the role of post-translational phosphorylation in this process, focusing on the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. They identified the Fkh2 transcription factor as a regulatory target of both Cdc28 and the cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk1, in a role distinct from its conserved function in cell cycle progression. In stationary phase yeast cells, Fkh2 undergoes a complex phosphorylation process, resulting in a diverse pool of phospho-isoforms. Upon hyphal induction, the phosphorylation profile of Fkh2 is transformed before reverting to the yeast profile. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses revealed that Cdc28 and Cbk1 phosphorylate specific residues on Fkh2. Substitution of these residues with non-phosphorylatable alanine altered the yeast phosphorylation profile and abrogated the characteristic transformation to the hyphal profile. Transcript profiling of the phosphorylation site mutant revealed that the hyphal phosphorylation profile is required for the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation. The researchers also identified that Fkh2 interacts with the chromatin modifier Pob3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a possible mechanism by which the phosphorylation of Fkh2 regulates its specificity. This study discovered a novel cell cycle-independent phospho-regulatory event that subverts a key component of the cell cycle machinery to a role in the switch from commensalism to pathogenicity.
Researchers have found that a specific enzyme called thymidine kinase (TK) is essential for the growth and infectivity of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes sleeping sickness in humans. This enzyme plays a crucial role in the synthesis of thymine nucleotides, which are necessary for the parasite's survival. Unlike humans, Trypanosoma brucei lacks an enzyme called dCMP deaminase, which provides an alternative route to thymine nucleotide formation. As a result, the parasite relies heavily on TK to produce thymine nucleotides.

Studies have shown that knocking out TK in the parasite leads to a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleosides, which are unable to be converted into usable thymine nucleotides. This buildup is due to the presence of an unidentified 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that converts deoxypyrimidine nucleotides into their corresponding nucleosides. The researchers also found that knocking out another enzyme called cytidine deaminase (CDA) leads to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy, further supporting the idea that TK is essential for thymine nucleotide synthesis.

The discovery of TK's essential role in Trypanosoma brucei has significant implications for the development of new treatments for sleeping sickness. The parasite's reliance on TK makes it a potential target for a single drug that could be effective against a diverse group of pathogenic single-celled eukaryotes.
Scientists have long known that a specific sequence of nucleotides, called the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, is necessary for ribosomes to bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) and initiate translation in prokaryotic cells. However, many genes lack this sequence, and it was unclear how translation initiation occurs in these cases. Researchers conducted a genome-wide search to identify sequence elements or secondary structural motifs that could facilitate translation initiation in mRNAs without Shine-Dalgarno sequences. They found that these mRNAs tend to be less structured in their translation initiation region, with a minimum of mRNA folding at the start codon. Using reporter gene constructs in bacteria, the researchers demonstrated that the local absence of RNA secondary structure is necessary and sufficient for translation initiation in the absence of a Shine-Dalgarno sequence. This suggests that the accessibility of the start codon, rather than specific sequence motifs or secondary structures, is the key factor in initiating translation in these mRNAs. The researchers also found that AUG start codons are typically located in single-stranded regions of the mRNA, while internal AUG codons are often found in structured regions. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for how the correct translation initiation site is recognized in the absence of a ribosome-binding site, and have implications for our understanding of gene expression in prokaryotic cells.
A study in Bihar, India, investigated the occurrence of Post Kala-Azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in patients treated with 20 mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). PKDL is a skin disorder that can occur in up to 10% of patients treated for VL in India. Between 2007 and 2012, 8,311 patients received Ambisome as first-line treatment for VL, with a high cure rate (99.3%) and low default rate (0.3%). Of these patients, 24 (0.3%) developed PKDL, with 89% having macular lesions. The median time to developing PKDL was 1.2 years after treatment. The study found no significant risk factors for developing PKDL in patients treated with Ambisome. However, the time to developing PKDL was shorter in patients treated with Ambisome compared to those who developed PKDL after previous treatment with sodium stibogluconate. The study suggests that PKDL is infrequent in patients treated with 20 mg/kg Ambisome, but the shorter median time to developing symptoms should be considered when counseling patients treated with this regimen.
Researchers studied the re-infestation patterns of Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after a community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. They used mathematical models to analyze the data and found that new bug populations were more likely to establish themselves from May to November than from November to May. This seasonal increase in bug establishment coincided with a seasonal increase in dispersal distance. The models also showed that the probability of new bug establishment increased with the time since the last detected infestation. These findings challenge the current understanding of T. infestans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge that need to be addressed through further experiments.

The researchers used both discrete- and continuous-time Markov models to analyze the data, which showed a strong seasonality in bug establishment on new sites by T. infestans, coinciding with seasonality in dispersal distance. The study addressed three key aspects of population control of T. infestans: the establishment rate of new local populations as a function of distance from existing local populations, possible mechanisms for the observed seasonality in bug establishment, and the effect of insecticide spraying and previous infestation on establishment rates. The results suggest that understanding the seasonality of bug dispersal intensity and distance is crucial for optimizing the timing of vector control.
Researchers studied the effects of a virus called SV40 on Syrian golden hamsters. SV40 is a type of polyomavirus that can cause infections in animals. The study found that SV40 can infect a wide range of tissues in hamsters, including the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. The virus was most persistent in the kidneys and liver, with the kidneys being the primary site of long-term infection.

The study also looked at the role of microRNA, a type of genetic material produced by the virus, in the infection process. MicroRNA is known to play a role in regulating gene expression, but its function in viral infections was not well understood. The researchers found that microRNA was expressed in hamsters infected with SV40 and that it helped to reduce the levels of viral DNA in infected tissues.

In contrast, viruses that did not produce microRNA had higher levels of viral DNA in the liver and kidney. The study also found that the structure of the regulatory region of the virus, which controls the expression of viral genes, affected the levels of viral DNA in infected tissues. Viruses with complex regulatory regions had higher levels of viral DNA in the kidney than those with simple regulatory regions.

The study's findings suggest that microRNA plays a role in regulating the levels of viral DNA in infected tissues and that it may help to limit the spread of the virus. However, the study also found that microRNA did not affect the ability of the virus to cause tumors in hamsters.
Researchers conducted the most comprehensive genome-wide scan for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset allowed for improved statistical power and enabled the application of new lineage- and clade-specific tests. Out of approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. The identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, as well as more specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and non-selection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. PSGs were expressed at significantly lower levels and in a more tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. Genes specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast were significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment of PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.
Staphylococcus aureus is a common pathogen that can cause persistent infections by forming biofilms on skin and mucosal surfaces. Biofilms are complex communities of bacteria held together by a protective matrix. Researchers have discovered a new component of the S. aureus biofilm matrix: amyloid-like fibers composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). These fibers contribute to the stability and integrity of the biofilm.

Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that PSMs have amyloid-like properties, similar to those found in other bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. When PSMs aggregate into amyloid fibers, they lose their ability to disassemble biofilms. In contrast, soluble PSM peptides can disperse biofilms. This suggests that the aggregation of PSMs into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms.

The researchers found that S. aureus produces amyloid-like fibers under certain growth conditions, and that these fibers are composed of PSMs. They also demonstrated that synthetic PSM peptides can self-assemble into amyloid-like fibers in the lab. These fibers have characteristics similar to known amyloid proteins. The discovery of amyloid-like fibers in S. aureus biofilms provides new insights into the mechanisms of biofilm formation and stability, and may have implications for the development of new treatments for S. aureus infections.
Researchers have developed a new method to monitor the persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in infected individuals. Chagas disease affects over 6 million people worldwide, mainly in Latin America, and is considered one of the 17 neglected illnesses by the World Health Organization. Current methods to monitor the disease, such as PCR testing, have limitations due to the low and fluctuating parasitic load in the blood.

A new antibody profiling assay has been developed to assess parasite persistence based on the waning of antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of the infection. The assay measures the diversity of antibodies against 15 selected T. cruzi antigens in serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One specific antibody response, Ab3, showed a strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by PCR positive results. High and sustained Ab3 signals were associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while a significant decline in Ab3 signals was observed in patients who cleared parasitemia based on blood PCR results.

Ab3 is a new surrogate biomarker that strongly correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznidazole-treated Chagas patients. The researchers hypothesize that Ab3 is induced and maintained by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based and shed parasites that are not consistently detectable by blood-based PCR techniques. A simple immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring the infectious status of seropositive patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes severe joint and muscle pain, and in some cases, chronic musculoskeletal pain persists for months or even years after the initial infection. Researchers have been trying to understand the mechanism behind this chronic disease, but the cells responsible for its persistence have been unclear. To identify these cells, scientists created a recombinant CHIKV that expresses Cre recombinase, which permanently marks infected cells in reporter mice. This virus, called CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre, replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts and induced arthritis in mice during the acute phase. Importantly, it also caused chronic disease, including persistent viral RNA and chronic myositis and synovitis, similar to the wild-type virus. Using this virus, researchers found that dermal and muscle fibroblasts, as well as skeletal myofibers, survived CHIKV infection and harbored persistent viral RNA. Treatment with an antibody against Mxra8, a host receptor for CHIKV, reduced the number of infected cells and diminished the levels of chronic viral RNA. This suggests that these cells are the reservoir of chronic viral RNA. The CHIKV-3ʹ-Cre and tdTomato reporter mouse system provides a useful tool for studying CHIKV pathogenesis in the acute and chronic stages of disease.
Researchers applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand how neural population activity relates to brain function. However, it was unclear how these results generalize to recordings with larger numbers of neurons and trials, or how they relate to the underlying network structure. To address this, the study applied factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and to spiking network models. The researchers compared the scaling trends of two key outputs of dimensionality reduction - shared dimensionality and percent shared variance - with neuron and trial count. They found that the scaling properties of networks with non-clustered and clustered connectivity differed, and that the in vivo recordings were more consistent with the clustered network. The study also found that recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify the dominant modes of shared variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. These findings can help guide the interpretation of dimensionality reduction outputs in regimes of limited neuron and trial sampling and help relate these outputs to the underlying network structure. The study suggests that factor analysis provides a more nuanced characterization of single-trial population activity than principal component analysis.
Researchers have discovered that a specific molecule, 2-amino acetophenone (2-AA), produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plays a crucial role in modulating the host's immune response to infection. Unlike other molecules that suppress the immune system, 2-AA actually increases the host's ability to cope with the pathogen while allowing it to persist in the body. When mice were treated with 2-AA before infection, they had a 90% survival rate, compared to 10% in untreated mice.

The study found that 2-AA activates key immune response pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also dampens the immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. This leads to a block in the activation of certain immune molecules, such as c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB, while preserving the activation of others, like extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2.

The researchers propose that 2-AA's ability to modulate the immune response allows the pathogen to switch to a chronic infection mode, enabling it to persist in the host while the host becomes tolerant to the infection. This finding reveals a new aspect of interkingdom communication between bacteria and their hosts, where the pathogen produces a molecule that promotes its own survival by modulating the host's immune response.
Scientists have discovered that a gene called L1TD1, which is derived from a type of retroelement called LINE-1, plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency in mammals. Pluripotency is the ability of cells to develop into any cell type in the body. L1TD1 is unique because its protein-coding sequence is almost entirely derived from a LINE-1 retroelement. Researchers investigated the origin and evolution of L1TD1 to understand how it acquired its role in pluripotency maintenance. They found that L1TD1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. The researchers also discovered that L1TD1 has evolved under positive selection in primates and mice, suggesting that it has been selected for functional novelty. They propose that L1TD1 may have originally evolved for genome defense against LINE-1 elements, and later became incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. The study highlights the role of retroelement gene domestication in fundamental aspects of mammalian biology and shows that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in different lineages. The researchers also found that L1TD1 has been lost in several megabat lineages, but not in sigmodontine rodents, suggesting that its loss is associated with the extinction of LINE-1 elements in these species.
A highly conserved bacterial protein called YbeY plays a crucial role in the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, which causes cholera. YbeY is an RNase, an enzyme that breaks down RNA, and is essential for the bacterium's survival and ability to cause disease. In Vibrio cholerae, YbeY is necessary for processing the 3' end of a type of RNA called 16S rRNA, which is a critical component of the ribosome, the cellular machinery that builds proteins. Without YbeY, the 16S rRNA is not properly processed, leading to defects in ribosome assembly and function. This, in turn, affects the bacterium's ability to produce virulence factors, such as cholera toxin, and to form biofilms, which are complex communities of bacteria that adhere to surfaces. In fact, a Vibrio cholerae strain lacking YbeY was unable to colonize mice and form biofilms, and produced reduced levels of cholera toxin. The study also found that YbeY is part of a small set of RNases that are essential in many pathogenic bacteria, suggesting that it plays a conserved role in bacterial physiology. Furthermore, the study showed that YbeY is involved in stress regulation and RNA processing, and that its depletion leads to the accumulation of 16S rRNA precursors and free ribosomal subunits. Overall, the study highlights the importance of YbeY in Vibrio cholerae and its potential as a target for the development of new antimicrobial therapies.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the structure of human transcription factor networks (TFNs) and their robustness to genetic and environmental perturbations. They found that all 41 human cell and tissue-specific TFNs share a common assortativity signature, which is a measure of the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect. This signature was found to confer phenotypic robustness to model TFNs. The researchers also determined the extent to which each of the four components of the assortativity signature contributes to this robustness. They used publicly available DNaseI-seq data to measure the assortativity signatures of genome-wide TFNs in 41 distinct human cell and tissue types. The results suggest that degree assortativity provides an additional structural source of robustness in biological networks. Theoretical work has shown that TFN models with increased assortativity exhibit increased robustness to both mutation in cis-regulatory sites and to gene duplication. This occurs because increased assortativity may either shrink the average size of nested subgraphs within the network or increase the average number of regulatory links that separate TFs, both of which tend to dampen the phenotypic effects of mutations.
Researchers used a large-scale multi-electrode array to record the activity of up to 74 neurons in the anesthetized adult rat somatosensory barrel cortex in response to different whisker stimuli. They found that individual inhibitory (INH) neurons were better at distinguishing between different stimuli than excitatory (EXC) neurons in the granular and infra-granular layers. Inhibitory neuron ensembles provided as much information about the stimuli as comparable ensembles of the most informative EXC neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests that a group of INH neurons plays a key role in processing sensory activity in the neocortical network.

The study showed that INH neurons in the granular and infra-granular layers had a higher level of stimulus-related information than EXC neurons. This was true for both individual neurons and groups of neurons. The researchers also found that INH neurons were more precise and less adapted to higher frequency stimulation than EXC neurons. As a result, INH neurons in layer 4 conveyed more information about different stimulus modalities, such as location and frequency, than EXC neurons in the same layer. Overall, the study highlights the importance of inhibitory neurons in processing sensory information in the neocortical network.
Scientists have successfully engineered a living cell to perform a fundamental arithmetic operation, binary addition, using a system based on regulatory RNAs. This achievement demonstrates the potential of RNA as a key player in synthetic biology and paves the way for more complex RNA-based biocomputers. The system, called a genetic half adder, was designed to sum two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations and report the result as fluorescence amplitudes in a living Escherichia coli cell. The system exploits post-transcriptional control to switch on tightly silenced genes with small RNAs and allosteric transcription factors to sense molecular signals. This approach allows for a more scalable and organized architecture compared to previous genetic half adders. The use of regulatory RNAs also reduces the genetic footprint of the system, making it more efficient. This work builds on previous efforts in RNA synthetic biology, which have led to the development of combinatorial logic gates, serial cascades, and feed-forward loops. The designer circuit can be used as a building block for more complex RNA-based biocomputers, opening up new possibilities for applications in synthetic biology. The use of regulatory RNAs offers an alternative to protein-based regulation, which has limitations in terms of composability and orthogonality with the host machinery. This achievement highlights the potential of RNA as a substrate for engineering gene expression programs that can robustly run in vivo.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds that can inhibit the activity of an enzyme called cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (cN-II). This enzyme plays a crucial role in regulating the levels of nucleotides within cells. High levels of cN-II have been linked to poor outcomes in patients treated with certain cancer therapies. To develop new treatments, scientists screened a group of chemical compounds called ribonucleoside phosphonates, which have a stable phosphorus-carbon bond instead of the usual phosphorus-oxygen bond found in natural nucleotides. Six of these compounds were found to be more effective at binding to cN-II than its natural substrate, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). Further analysis revealed that three specific amino acids on the enzyme, phenylalanine 157, histidine 209, and tyrosine 210, play a key role in binding these compounds. Experimental tests confirmed that these phosphonate analogues can completely inhibit cN-II activity at a concentration of 2 millimolar. This study highlights the potential of these compounds as new inhibitors of cN-II and sheds light on the importance of the phosphorus-carbon bond in their design. The findings could lead to the development of new treatments for cancer and other diseases where cN-II plays a role.
A recent study has found evidence of prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a type of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). This is the first time prion infectivity has been detected in milk from TSE-affected ruminant flocks. The study found that prion infectivity was present in milk and colostrum from sheep with both healthy and diseased mammary glands. The infectivity was detected in all fractions of milk and colostrum, including the cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions. The study used a mouse model to measure the infectious titre, which was found to be equivalent to that contained in 6 micrograms of a posterior brain stem from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. This suggests that milk and colostrum from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to the transmission of the disease to other animals, either directly or through the presence of milk-derived material in animal feedstuffs. The study also raises concerns about the risk of TSE exposure to humans through milk products from ovine and other TSE-susceptible dairy species. The findings indicate that the presence of ectopic lymphoid follicles in ewes with lymphoproliferative mastitis may increase prion shedding in milk. The study provides definitive evidence of the presence of infectivity in milk and colostrum from naturally incubating scrapie ewes, with infectivity detected up to 20 months before clinical disease onset.
During the 2014-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in Liberia, researchers analyzed data from 16,370 laboratory samples collected between April 2014 and March 2015. A total of 10,536 individuals were identified, with 3,897 confirmed cases of EVD. The study found significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for Ebola virus RNA. Young children and the elderly, as well as those living in rural areas, were found to be at higher risk of death from the disease. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period.

The data collection process was challenging due to malfunctioning surveillance and reporting systems, resulting in missing and duplicate data. However, EVD diagnostic laboratories were able to systematically record basic demographic and clinical information for patients. The study's findings may contribute to a better understanding of the outbreak in Liberia and inform future investigations. The data were not anonymized, as they were collected for public health response purposes rather than research. Despite some limitations, the study's results provide valuable insights into the EVD outbreak in Liberia, which could be useful for further epidemiological investigations.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, an enzyme that converts phenol into its corresponding ortho-quinone. Tyrosinase is a copper-containing monooxygenase that relies on a "caddie" protein to facilitate the transport of copper ions into its active center. A key residue in the caddie protein, Tyr98, plays a crucial role in the reaction. In a previous study, it was found that Tyr98 is converted to a reactive quinone through the formation of intermediate compounds. However, the exact mechanism of this reaction remained unclear.

To shed light on this process, researchers used cryo-trapped crystal structures to determine the high-resolution structures of the tyrosinase-caddie complex. These structures revealed a previously unknown step in the reaction: the movement of CuA, a copper ion, triggers a rearrangement of the copper ligands, allowing the hydroxyl group of the substrate to be placed in an optimal position for reaction. This rearrangement enables the electrophilic attack on the aromatic ring by the Cu2O2 oxidant, leading to the formation of the quinone product.

The researchers also used UV-vis and resonance Raman spectroscopy to confirm the formation of intermediate compounds, including the μ-η2:η2-peroxo-dicopper(II) and Cu(II)-dopasemiquinone. These findings have led to a proposed catalytic mechanism of tyrosinase, which involves the movement of CuA and the rearrangement of copper ligands to facilitate the hydroxylation reaction.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the early stages of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, specifically the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit. The first step in this process involves the formation of the first pre-60S particle, which contains 30 assembly factors (AFs), including 8 RNA helicases. One of these helicases, Dbp6p, is essential for the normal accumulation of the first pre-60S particle in yeast. However, the mechanisms by which these helicases are targeted to their correct substrate within pre-ribosomal particles and their precise molecular roles remain unclear.

A complex of four AFs, including Npa1p, Npa2p, Nop8p, and Rsa3p, has been identified to associate with Dbp6p prior to its incorporation into the 90S pre-ribosomal particles. Npa1p forms the backbone of this complex and is essential for the stable integration of Dbp6p within the initial 90S pre-ribosomal particle. The Npa1p complex also plays a crucial role in the formation and/or clustering of root helices of large subunit rRNAs, which creates the core of the large ribosomal subunit RNA structure. Additionally, Npa1p cross-links to snoRNAs involved in decoding center and peptidyl transferase center modifications. These findings suggest that the Dbp6p helicase and the Npa1p complex play key roles in the compaction of the central core of 25S rRNA and the control of snoRNA-pre-rRNA interactions.
Researchers investigated the role of catecholamines, specifically norepinephrine and dopamine, in regulating learning rate in a dynamic environment. They used a combination of pharmacology, scalp electrophysiology, and computational modeling to study 32 participants. The study found that the P3 component of the EEG, which is an electrophysiological index of phasic catecholamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning rate. This suggests that the phasic catecholamine response following surprising outcomes drives subsequent increases in learning rate. The study also found that P3 amplitude mediated the effects of unexpectedness of an outcome and uncertainty of a preexisting belief on learning rate. Furthermore, a pharmacological manipulation of catecholamine activity affected learning rate following unanticipated task changes, in a way that depended on participants' baseline learning rate. These findings provide converging evidence for a causal role of the human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change.
Researchers implemented a syndromic surveillance system called EPIMIC in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases. The system uses data from point-of-care (POC) laboratories to detect abnormal epidemiological events. Between 2010 and 2016, two POC laboratories were established in the Saloum region of Senegal, and EPIMIC was implemented to analyze the data from these labs. Over five years, 2,577 patients were tested, and 739 were found to be positive for at least one of the 15 pathogens being monitored. The system generated 443 alarms, indicating potential outbreaks or unusual disease patterns. In 2016, a third POC laboratory was established in the Niakhar region, and EPIMIC was implemented there as well. Over the next five years, 316 patients were tested, and 56 were found to be positive for at least one of the 15 pathogens. The system generated 14 alarms. The researchers found that EPIMIC was successful in detecting true epidemiological events without requiring significant human or economic resources. The system's scalability and versatility allowed it to be implemented in rural Senegal in less than a month. EPIMIC's main advantage is its ability to monitor a large number of POC tests and pathogens in near real-time. However, further improvements are needed to enhance the system. The researchers conclude that initiatives like the implementation of rural POC laboratories and syndromic surveillance systems like EPIMIC are essential for improving global knowledge of infectious diseases.
Researchers investigated how the arrangement of endothelial cells affects their response to external stimuli, such as histamine. They found that when endothelial cells are arranged in a network, they exhibit calcium oscillations in response to histamine, but individual cells and monolayers do not. The study used a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning to understand the role of cellular architecture in collective calcium signaling and cell contractility.

The researchers discovered that the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junctional intercellular communication determines the occurrence of calcium oscillations. They found that as the number of neighboring cells increases, the rate of calcium oscillations decreases. This suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to the vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling.

The study also found that the calcium oscillations attenuate the histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential cell responses in an architecture-dependent manner. This means that the arrangement of endothelial cells affects how they respond to histamine, with networks of cells responding differently than individual cells or monolayers.

The researchers used a computational model to understand the mechanism of architecture-dependent calcium signaling. They found that the intracellular calcium dynamics driven by calcium-induced calcium release were highly sensitive to the cytosolic calcium concentration, and that the membrane potential and coupling current created the oscillations in coupled cells. Overall, the study provides new insights into how endothelial cells respond to external stimuli and how their arrangement affects their behavior.
Researchers studied how the body's immune system responds to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants. They used a technique called phage display to identify the specific parts of the virus's G protein that the immune system targets. The study found that the immune system responds to multiple areas of the G protein, not just the central conserved domain (CCD) previously thought to be the main target.

The researchers created different versions of the G protein, some with and some without the CCD, and tested their ability to elicit an immune response in rabbits and mice. They found that the versions without the CCD still generated antibodies that could bind to the virus, but these antibodies were not as effective at neutralizing the virus.

Despite this, the mice that received the CCD-deleted G protein were still protected from RSV infection, as measured by reduced viral loads in the lungs and nasal cavity. The researchers also found that the immune response in these mice was characterized by a low ratio of Th2 to Th1 cytokines, which is associated with a more effective immune response.

These findings suggest that there are multiple protective sites on the RSV G protein outside of the CCD that could be targeted by a vaccine. The researchers propose that a bacterially produced, unglycosylated G protein could be a safe and effective vaccine against RSV disease.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for the gene brr2 in the development of a specific type of neuron in fruit flies called Tv4 neurons. These neurons produce a neuropeptide called FMRFa, which plays a vital role in the fly's nervous system. The study found that brr2 is involved in controlling the expression of FMRFa specifically in the Tv4 neurons, and that it does so through two independent mechanisms. First, brr2 helps the Tv4 axon find its way to the target tissue, where it receives a signal that triggers the production of FMRFa. Second, brr2 ensures that two genes involved in the BMP signaling pathway, tkv and Medea, are properly spliced, allowing the signal to be received and processed correctly. Without brr2, the Tv4 neurons fail to develop properly, highlighting the importance of precise RNA processing in the development of the nervous system. This study sheds light on the complex interactions between neurons and their target tissues during development, and has implications for our understanding of how the nervous system forms and functions. The discovery of brr2's role in Tv4 neuron development also raises questions about its potential involvement in human diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, where the human ortholog of brr2 has been implicated.
Researchers have discovered a new way that cells regulate the abundance of F-box proteins, which are crucial components of a type of enzyme called cullin-RING ligases (CRLs). CRLs are involved in many cellular processes, including the degradation of proteins that can lead to diseases such as cancer. F-box proteins are a key part of CRLs, but their levels need to be tightly controlled to ensure the proper functioning of these enzymes. One way to control F-box protein levels is through a process called autocatalytic ubiquitylation, where the F-box protein is tagged with a molecule called ubiquitin and then broken down by the proteasome. However, a new study has identified an additional pathway for regulating F-box protein levels that does not involve autocatalytic ubiquitylation. This new pathway targets F-box proteins that are not associated with a protein called Skp1, and it requires a different component of the CRL complex called Cdc53/Cul1. The study found that this pathway is essential for maintaining chromosome stability and protecting cells from heavy metal stress. The discovery of this new pathway highlights the importance of Cdc53/Cul1 in regulating F-box protein levels and suggests that it has functions independent of its association with Skp1. This finding provides new insights into the complex regulation of CRLs and their role in maintaining cellular homeostasis.
Kinesin-3 motors, such as KIF1A, play a crucial role in transporting synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. These motors are typically kept inactive in the absence of cargo to prevent unnecessary ATP hydrolysis and motility. Current models suggest that KIF1A motors are monomeric in the inactive state and become activated through concentration-driven dimerization on the cargo membrane. However, a recent study has challenged this model, finding that KIF1A motors are actually dimeric in their inactive state. This means that cargo-induced dimerization is not a valid mechanism for activating KIF1A motors. Instead, the study suggests that KIF1A motors are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms, which can be overcome by cargo binding. The study also found that only dimeric KIF1A motors undergo processive, ATP-dependent motility, which is essential for long-distance transport in neuronal cells. This processive motility is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtubules, with an average velocity comparable to that of vesicles moving in vivo. The study's findings provide new insights into the regulation and function of KIF1A motors, which are essential for the transport of synaptic vesicles and other cargoes in neuronal cells.
Researchers investigated the regulation of seed metabolism in tomatoes by analyzing the metabolite profiles of 76 different tomato introgression lines grown in two consecutive harvest seasons. The study found that amino acid contents showed a high degree of variability across the population, while sugar levels exhibited significant seasonal fluctuations. Factorial ANOVA confirmed the presence of 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci (mQTL), indicating that the genetic background of the plants played a significant role in determining metabolite levels.

Network analysis revealed that amino acids in the seed metabolic network played a central hub-like role, interacting with other metabolite categories such as sugars and organic acids. Six amino acids - glycine, serine, threonine, isoleucine, valine, and proline - were found to be highly co-regulated and tightly connected in the network. The study also showed that the seed metabolic network displayed tighter interdependence of metabolic processes compared to the fruit metabolic network.

The results suggest that the regulation of seed metabolism is complex and influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The study highlights the importance of integrating metabolic network analysis with mQTL mapping to understand the genetic basis of natural variability in seed primary metabolism. The findings also indicate that the mode of inheritance of metabolite traits in seeds differs from that in fruits, and that amino acids play a central role in the regulation of seed metabolism. Overall, the study provides new insights into the regulation of seed metabolism and its relationship with fruit metabolism in tomatoes.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding how the bacterial pathogen Vibrio cholerae colonizes different surfaces, including the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract. A key player in this process is the N-acetylglucosamine binding protein (GbpA), which has been shown to mediate bacterial attachment to both marine chitin and mammalian intestinal mucin. However, the molecular mechanism behind this binding was previously unknown.

Using a combination of X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering, researchers determined the three-dimensional structure of GbpA and found that it has an unusual, elongated four-domain fold. Two of these domains are structurally similar to known chitin binding modules and are responsible for binding to chitin. The other two domains show distant structural homology to bacterial pili binding proteins and are involved in binding the V. cholerae surface.

Further studies revealed that GbpA binds to GlcNAc oligosaccharides and that domains 1 and 4 of the protein interact with chitin in vitro. In vivo complementation studies showed that domain 1 is also crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Mouse virulence assays demonstrated that only the first three domains of GbpA are required for colonization. These findings explain how GbpA provides modular interactions between V. cholerae, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons, shedding light on the molecular properties governing the protein's ability to mediate interactions between the bacteria and host surfaces.
Researchers have found that in people with pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), a specific type of immune cell called T effector cells (Teff) is resistant to regulation by another type of immune cell called regulatory T cells (Treg). This resistance is due to the presence of a subset of Teff cells that express a protein called HLA-DR. These HLA-DR+ Teff cells are more active and produce higher levels of certain cytokines, such as IFNG and IL17A, which can counteract the suppressive function of Treg cells. As a result, Treg cells are unable to effectively control the activity of Teff cells, leading to chronic immune activation and inflammation in TB patients. The researchers found that blocking the CCR5 and PD-L1 pathways, which are involved in Treg suppression, restored the sensitivity of Teff cells to Treg regulation. They also found that HLA-DR+ Teff cells express higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines, which can negatively regulate Treg function. This study provides new insights into how activated HLA-DR+CD4+ T cells contribute to disease-associated inflammation in TB by compromising Treg-mediated suppression. The findings suggest that HLA-DR+ Teff cells may be a potential functional marker of disease and could be used to monitor disease progression and response to therapy.
Researchers studied how prions, misfolded proteins that cause disease, propagate in mice that lack a specific anchor on their prion protein. These mice, called tgGPI− mice, are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate the misfolded protein outside of their cells. The study found that two types of prions, RML and ME7, were able to propagate in tgGPI− mice, but with some unexpected results. The prions developed new characteristics, or "tropisms," that allowed them to infect cells in a way that was different from the original prions. Additionally, the levels of the misfolded protein in the tgGPI− mice were 25-50 times higher than in normal mice. When the prions were transferred back to normal mice, the ME7 prions returned to their original form, but the RML prions gave rise to a new, stable prion strain called SFL. This new strain remained unchanged even after three passages in normal mice. The researchers propose that the high levels of misfolded protein in the tgGPI− mice may be due to the stability of the protein outside of the cell, rather than inside. This study provides new insights into how prions propagate and adapt to different environments, and may have implications for our understanding of prion diseases such as mad cow disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
Researchers studied the role of the BMP signaling pathway in the development of the dorsal ectoderm in Drosophila embryos. They used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the transcriptional network regulated by BMP signaling. The study found that BMP signaling is opposed by the EGF signaling pathway, and that EGF signaling negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription. The researchers identified multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. They also found that the BMP gene network has a self-regulating property, establishing a balance between its activity and that of the EGF signaling pathway to facilitate correct patterning. The study identified key roles for the Zelda and Zerknüllt transcription factors in establishing the resulting expression domain, and found widespread binding of insulator proteins to the Mad and Brinker-bound genomic regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator protein showed reduced transcription of a peak BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioserosa cells, the fate specified by peak BMP signaling. The researchers incorporated their findings into a model for Mad-dependent activation and discussed its relevance to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates. The study provides new insights into the regulation of the BMP signaling pathway and its role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major have been increasing and spreading from the south-west to new areas in the center. To better understand the evolution and population dynamics of L. major, researchers analyzed human isolates from three governorates where the disease is endemic: Gafsa, Kairouan, and Sidi Bouzid. The isolates were collected during two periods: 1991-1992 and 2008-2012.

The analysis of the isolates from Sidi Bouzid showed that over two decades, L. major evolved by generating genetically differentiated populations. The genetic patterns of the 2008-2012 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L. major populations did not spread gradually from the south to the center of Tunisia, suggesting that human activities might be the source of the disease expansion. The genotype analysis also suggests previous and current flows of genotypes between governorates and districts.

The study found a decreasing genetic gradient from Gafsa to Kairouan and Sidi Bouzid, with Gafsa being the oldest and most well-established focus of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis. However, the chronology of disease emergence does not necessarily correspond to the real spread of leishmaniasis. The study suggests that human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes could explain how the disease progresses. The findings provide new insights into the evolution and spread of L. major in Tunisia, which may improve our understanding of the parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
A recent study evaluated the effectiveness of anthelmintic chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. The study found that repeated treatment with albendazole and praziquantel significantly reduced the odds of infection with any soil-transmitted helminth (STH) species. Specifically, the odds of infection with any STH species were lower for individuals treated with albendazole, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.05, 0.20, p < 0.001). Access to safe flooring was also found to offer some additional protection against STH infections, with an aOR of 0.34 (95% CI: 0.20, 0.56, p < 0.001).

For schistosomiasis, only treatment with praziquantel was found to be protective, with an aOR of 0.30 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.60, p = 0.001). Among individuals not treated with albendazole or praziquantel, the most protective intervention package to reduce the probability of STH infections included safe flooring (aOR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.59, p < 0.001) and latrine access (aOR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.35, 0.99, p = 0.05). The study found no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthelmintic chemotherapy and WASH resources.
Scientists have discovered the structure of a bacterial toxin called LlpA, which is produced by certain bacteria that live on plants. This toxin can selectively kill closely related bacteria, including some that cause plant diseases. The researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the three-dimensional structure of LlpA and found that it consists of two similar domains, called MMBL domains, which are also found in plant lectins. One of these domains, the C-terminal MMBL domain, is responsible for binding to sugars and is crucial for the toxin's bactericidal activity. The other domain, the N-terminal MMBL domain, is structurally similar but lacks a functional sugar-binding site and is responsible for determining the toxin's target specificity.

Mutational analysis showed that the sugar-binding pocket in the C-domain is essential for the toxin's activity, while the N-domain plays a key role in selecting the target bacteria. The researchers also found that the toxin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved separately to perform different functions. This is the first time a prokaryotic member of the MMBL lectin family has been identified, and the study provides new insights into the structure and function of this family of proteins. The discovery of LlpA's structure and mechanism of action may lead to the development of new strategies for controlling plant diseases caused by these bacteria.
Researchers have discovered a novel secretion apparatus in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis that plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and development of its spores. During the sporulation process, the developing spore, or forespore, resides within a mother cell and undergoes a series of coordinated developmental programs. The regulation of the forespore transcription factor σG, which is essential for this process, has been poorly understood. A team of scientists has identified eight mother-cell proteins encoded in the spoIIIA operon and the forespore protein SpoIIQ that are required for σG activity. These proteins share similarities with components of specialized secretion systems, including a secretion ATPase. The researchers found that the ATPase motifs in one of these proteins, SpoIIIAA, are necessary for σG activity and spore formation. They also discovered that the SpoIIIA proteins and SpoIIQ form a multimeric complex that spans the two membranes surrounding the forespore. This complex is essential for maintaining forespore integrity, and its absence leads to the forespore developing large invaginations and collapsing. Importantly, the maintenance of forespore integrity does not require σG activity. The findings suggest that the SpoIIIA-SpoIIQ complex forms a novel secretion apparatus that links the mother cell and forespore, allowing the mother cell to nurture the forespore and maintain its physiology during spore maturation.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD). They analyzed data from 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls, but did not find any individual genetic loci that reached genome-wide significance. However, they did find a significant association between the power to detect genetic effects and the likelihood of replication across all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This suggests that larger studies may be able to identify common genetic variations associated with BD near exons, which are functional regions of genes. The researchers also found that SNPs near exons had a higher probability of replication, indicating an enrichment of reproducible associations in these regions. This study provides a framework for assessing the potential for replication when combining results from multiple studies. The findings suggest that larger studies may be able to identify genetic variants associated with BD near exons, which could lead to a better understanding of the genetic basis of the disorder. Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population and is characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression. Despite its high heritability, previous studies have struggled to identify genetic loci associated with BD. This study's results provide new insights into the genetic architecture of BD and highlight the importance of larger studies in identifying genetic variants associated with the disorder.
Researchers have long sought to understand the mechanisms behind cell proliferation, particularly in cancerous cells. A new study presents a genome-wide analysis of cancer proliferation based on gene expression and growth rate measurements of 12,690 genes across 60 cancer cell lines. The study assigns a Cancer Proliferation Index (cPI) to each gene, which quantifies its association with growth rate. The results show that genes essential for cancer growth have positive cPI values, while tumor suppressors have negative cPI values.

The analysis reveals that cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production processes are positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration is negatively associated. A parallel analysis of non-cancerous proliferation indices (nPI) across 224 lymphoblastoid cell lines highlights differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation. The study identifies genes in the translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer proliferation-associated proteins.

A cross-species comparison reveals that cancer proliferation resembles that of microorganisms, while non-cancerous proliferation does not. Combining cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation signatures leads to enhanced prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer. The study's findings point to inherent differences between cancerous and non-cancerous proliferation determinants, which may contribute to the development of novel cancer-specific anti-proliferative drugs.
Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a parasitic disease caused by the Echinococcus tapeworm, can affect the heart and vena cava, but few cases have been reported. A 15-year study of 11 patients with cardiac and/or endovascular CE found that the most common symptoms were thoracic pain and dyspnea, although two patients were asymptomatic. The cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava, and nine patients had previously been diagnosed with disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the primary diagnostic method, but other tests such as serology, electrocardiogram, and computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging also aided in diagnosis and follow-up.

Nine patients underwent cardiac surgery, and nine received long-term antiparasitic treatment for a median duration of 25 months. One patient died during surgery due to cyst rupture and endovascular dissemination, while two patients died 10 and 14 years after diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure, respectively. Patients with cardiac involvement only did not experience complications after surgery and were considered cured, but those with vena cava involvement developed pulmonary embolisms and had multiple complications.

The study found that cardiovascular CE is associated with a high risk of potentially lethal complications, and clinical manifestations and complications vary depending on the location of the cysts. Isolated cardiac CE may be cured after surgery, while endovascular extracardiac involvement is associated with severe chronic complications. The study suggests that CE should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in patients from endemic areas.
Researchers have identified a protein called TirS in the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus that helps the bacteria evade the human immune system. TirS is a mimic of a human protein called Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR), which plays a key role in the body's initial response to infection. When TirS is expressed in human cells, it inhibits the TLR signaling pathway, which is responsible for triggering an inflammatory response. This means that TirS helps S. aureus to downregulate the body's immune response, making it harder for the body to fight off the infection.

In a mouse model of skin infection, researchers found that S. aureus strains with the tirS gene were less virulent than those without it. This suggests that TirS plays a role in reducing the severity of S. aureus infections. The researchers also found that TirS is associated with a genetic element that confers resistance to the antibiotic fusidic acid, which is used to treat S. aureus infections. This raises the possibility that TirS may also contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus.

The study also found that TirS interacts with a protein called MyD88, which is a key component of the TLR signaling pathway. When TirS is expressed, it inhibits the activity of MyD88, which in turn reduces the body's inflammatory response to the infection. The researchers suggest that TirS may be a key factor in the ability of S. aureus to cause disease, and that targeting TirS may be a potential strategy for developing new treatments for S. aureus infections.
Researchers studied the development of fruit flies and malaria mosquitoes to understand how their embryos form and grow. They analyzed gene expression data from both species to identify differences in how genes are turned on and off during development. The study found that many genes have similar patterns of expression in both species, but some genes have different timing and duration of expression. By clustering these genes based on their expression patterns, the researchers identified groups of genes that are involved in specific developmental processes, such as the formation of extra-embryonic tissues and the transition from maternal to zygotic gene expression.

One cluster of genes was found to be involved in the formation of the mosquito's serosa, a layer of tissue that is not present in fruit flies. This cluster was also found to be re-engaged later in development, during cuticle synthesis. Another cluster of genes showed a sharp reduction in expression at the maternal-zygotic transition in fruit flies, but sustained expression in mosquitoes. The researchers propose that this method of clustering genes based on their expression patterns can be used to identify the genetic basis of morphological differences between species.

The study provides a new framework for comparing gene expression data across different species and identifying genes involved in specific developmental processes. The results highlight the importance of considering the timing and duration of gene expression in understanding developmental biology. The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of developmental processes and the genetic basis of morphological diversity.
Researchers conducted a study in rural villages of Papua New Guinea to investigate the presence of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, bacteria that cause leg ulcers, in asymptomatic individuals, flies, and household linens. The study found that 21% of asymptomatic participants had detectable Haemophilus ducreyi DNA on their skin, and 1% had detectable Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA. This is the first time that Haemophilus ducreyi DNA has been detected on the skin of asymptomatic children.

The study also found that 90% of flies tested had Haemophilus ducreyi DNA, and 50% had Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA. Additionally, 33% of bed sheets sampled had Haemophilus ducreyi DNA, and 17% had Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue DNA. The study suggests that the ubiquity of Haemophilus ducreyi in the environment is a contributing factor to the spread of the organism.

The researchers also found that people who changed their bed linens less than once a week were more likely to have detectable Haemophilus ducreyi DNA on their skin. The study did not find a significant difference in Haemophilus ducreyi DNA positivity between participants exposed or not exposed to a case of Haemophilus ducreyi ulcer in the household.

This study provides new insights into the transmission of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, and highlights the importance of environmental sources, such as flies and household linens, in the spread of these bacteria.
The International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in the field. These competencies aim to address the diverse backgrounds and intended application areas of various populations in need of bioinformatics training. The initial competencies were developed through surveys of employers and training programs, and have since been refined through a multi-year process of community engagement. The competencies are designed to be applicable across different user personas and training programs, and are intended to facilitate the sharing of experiences and best practices in bioinformatics education. A series of use cases is presented to illustrate the application of the competencies in various training contexts, highlighting their value in defining, refining, and assessing bioinformatics training mechanisms. These use cases demonstrate the versatility of the competencies in addressing different training needs, user personas, types of training programs, and educational settings. The core competencies are not intended to be a prescription for a specific set of curricula or curricular standards, but rather a basis for the community of bioinformatics educators to draw upon their common experiences in designing, refining, and evaluating their own training programs. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans for the continued refinement and application of the bioinformatics core competencies.
Researchers studied the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercoralis, which infects over one billion people worldwide, to understand how its developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3i) is regulated. Unlike other parasitic nematodes, S. stercoralis has a unique life cycle that includes both parasitic and free-living forms. The researchers compared S. stercoralis to the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which has a similar developmentally arrested larval form called the dauer. They used deep-sequencing to analyze the transcriptome of S. stercoralis at seven developmental stages and identified homologs of C. elegans dauer genes. The study found that genes involved in the cGMP pathway were up-regulated in L3i, while insulin/IGF-1-like signaling (IIS) ligands were scarce in S. stercoralis compared to C. elegans. The researchers also identified seven S. stercoralis genes encoding homologs of the single C. elegans dauer regulatory TGFβ ligand, three of which were only expressed in L3i. The study suggests that while dauer pathway genes are present in S. stercoralis and may play a role in L3i development, there are significant differences between the two species. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms governing L3i development and may lead to novel treatment and control strategies for S. stercoralis infections.
Researchers studied the effects of two bacterial toxins, Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on the structure and function of cells. These toxins are associated with digestive cancers and are secreted by many pathogenic bacteria. The study found that CDT and colibactin cause significant changes in the nucleus of cells, leading to the formation of deep invaginations in the nuclear envelope. These invaginations, called nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR), are active sites of mRNA translation and contain ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, and polyadenylated RNA.

The NR structures are dynamic and transient, forming in response to genotoxic stress caused by the bacterial toxins. They are thought to be a privileged gateway for the synthesis of selected mRNA, which is then translated in the nucleus. The study suggests that these structures allow cells to pause and repair DNA damage caused by the toxins, promoting cell survival. This process may contribute to the resistance of cancer cells to certain treatments, such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

The researchers used a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including cell cultures and mouse models, to study the effects of CDT and colibactin on nuclear remodeling. They found that the formation of NR is a common feature of many cancers, not only in response to DNA damage caused by treatments, but also in response to genotoxic bacteria. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of nuclear remodeling and its role in cell survival and cancer development.
Researchers used three-dimensional computed tomography (3D-CT) to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy. Leprosy, a bacterial infection, can cause facial deformities, including a "saddle nose" and regression of the maxilla, or upper jawbone. However, previous studies have only used subjective visual grading to assess maxillary changes in living patients. In this study, 3D images of the maxilla were reconstructed from CT scans of 10 former leprosy patients and 5 control subjects. The researchers measured the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA-P) and found significant atrophy in three patients with lepromatous leprosy, consistent with paleopathological findings from excavated skeletal remains. The study also allowed for precise calculation of bone defects, which could aid in reconstructive surgery. The use of 3D-CT images enabled easier evaluation of maxillary deformities and provided a more accurate assessment of the extent of bone loss. This method may become a valuable tool for reconstructive surgery and could help eliminate social segregation and prejudice associated with leprosy. While the study had a small sample size, the results suggest that 3D-CT is a promising approach for evaluating maxillary deformities and may contribute to novel surgical treatments for facial deformity.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system represents sounds in the presence of background noise. They found that the strength of adaptation to sound statistics increases as one ascends the auditory pathway, from the auditory nerve to the midbrain to the cortex. This adaptation allows the brain to build noise-invariant representations of sounds, making it easier to identify behaviorally relevant sounds in noisy environments. The study used complex synthetic and natural sounds, recording neuronal responses in the inferior colliculus and primary fields of the auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets, and comparing these responses with a sophisticated model of the auditory nerve. The results show that the code for complex sounds in the periphery is affected more by the addition of noise than the cortical code. However, populations that show the strongest adaptation to stimulus statistics are also the most noise-tolerant. This suggests that the increase in adaptation to sound statistics from the auditory nerve to the midbrain to the cortex is an important stage in the construction of noise-invariant sound representations in the higher auditory brain. The study also found that as one progresses through the auditory pathway, neural responses become progressively more independent of the level of background noise. By the level of the cortex, neural populations represent the signal in a more noise-tolerant fashion, responding to sound features that are common between clean and noisy conditions.
Researchers studied how yeast cells respond to heat shock by analyzing changes in their protein-protein interaction network, also known as the interactome. They found that heat shock causes a significant decrease in the connections between different modules of the interactome, leading to a partial disintegration of its global organization. This change is similar to a "stratus-cumulus" transition, where the interactome shifts from a globally connected structure to a more multifocal one.

The study used data from the BioGRID database to calculate the weight of each protein-protein interaction in both resting and heat-shocked yeast cells. They found that the median weight of interactions decreased by 14% in heat-shocked cells. The researchers also identified key proteins that became centers of local communities and bridges connecting modules after heat shock.

These findings suggest that heat shock induces a non-trivial adaptation to stress at the system level, rather than a direct consequence of mRNA changes. The partial disintegration of the interactome was observed at multiple levels of network topology. Additionally, the study found that certain proteins played a crucial role in maintaining connections between modules after heat shock.

The researchers propose that this adaptation mechanism may be generalizable to other complex systems, such as social networks and ecosystems, which may also exhibit a decrease in inter-modular links and a shift towards more compact modules in response to stress or crisis. This study provides a model of a system-level adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of amiodarone in treating ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a chronic condition caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, prevalent in Latin America. The study included 9 studies, with 2 providing individual patient data for analysis. The results showed that amiodarone significantly reduced the number of ventricular tachycardia episodes, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular couplets in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy. Specifically, amiodarone reduced ventricular tachycardia episodes by 99.9%, ventricular premature beats by 93.1%, and ventricular couplets by 79%. The study also found that amiodarone was associated with various adverse side effects, including corneal microdeposits, gastrointestinal events, sinus bradycardia, dermatological events, and drug discontinuation. The quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. While amiodarone appears to be effective in reducing uncomfortable symptoms and potentially fatal events related to ventricular tachycardia, there is no direct evidence for its effect on clinically relevant outcomes such as sudden death or hospitalization. The study's findings support the use of amiodarone, but highlight the need to balance potential benefits and harms at the individual level for decision-making.
Researchers analyzed medical records from two hospitals in rural Ecuador to study the seasonal patterns of dengue fever from 2009 to 2016. They found that dengue fever cases peaked in mid-March and were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but less likely on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays did not have a significant impact on dengue fever diagnoses, except for an increase in diagnoses on the day after Christmas. The study also found that school schedules did not affect dengue diagnoses in school-aged children.

The researchers used a statistical model to separate the effects of climate and non-climate factors on dengue fever seasonality. They found that climate variables, such as total precipitation and minimum temperature, had small but significant effects on the risk of dengue fever diagnoses. The study is one of the first to report long-term dengue fever seasonality in Ecuador and provides valuable information for local disease prevention efforts and public health planning. The findings can also inform global and regional models of dengue fever trends.
Researchers have discovered a new way to boost the body's innate immune system to fight off viral infections without triggering autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. They found that expressing a protein called RdRP, which is involved in viral replication, can activate the innate immune system in mice and make them resistant to lethal viral challenges. This activation occurs without the need for antigen-specific recognition or prior knowledge of the causative agent, making it a potential solution for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. The researchers showed that RdRP-transgenic mice have a dramatic upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are critical for antiviral defense, and are resistant to normally lethal viral infections. They also found that this mechanism operates independently of the adaptive immune system and is mediated by the MDA5 and MAVS proteins. Importantly, the mice remained healthy and had normal longevity despite the lifelong elevation of ISGs. The researchers demonstrated that this RdRP-mediated antiviral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within the RdRP mRNA but operates at the protein level and requires RdRP catalysis. These findings provide a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiviral protection and could potentially lead to the development of new treatments for viral infections.
Researchers tested the independent-action hypothesis (IAH) for a plant RNA virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), to determine if the effective population size (Ne) is dose-dependent. The IAH states that each virion has a probability of infection and acts independently of other virions during the infection process. The study used TEV variants carrying fluorescent markers to infect Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants at different doses. The results showed that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary infection foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency.

The study found that the probability of a genotype infecting a plant systemically was near 1, but in rare cases, genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted using the independent-action model. The results suggest that the IAH holds for TEV, and Ne is dose-dependent for this plant RNA virus. The study also found that the mean number of virions causing systemic infection can be very small, approaching 1 at low doses.

The researchers speculate that the independent-action model may apply to many mono-partite plant viruses, but further experiments are needed to confirm this. The study's findings have implications for experimental evolution with plant viruses and highlight the importance of considering dose effects when comparing Ne estimates for different viruses.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how genes are turned on and off in different parts of the body. This method, called Sparse Bayesian Regression, allows scientists to analyze gene expression in multiple tissues at the same time and identify genetic variants that control gene expression. The new approach is more powerful than traditional methods and can reveal complex genetic regulatory mechanisms that were previously unknown.

The researchers tested their method on a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues and found that it was able to identify genetic variants that control gene expression in a way that traditional methods could not. They also found that about 27% of genes have common genetic regulation across all four tissues, which was not detected by single-tissue analyses. This means that the new method can identify genetic variants that affect gene expression in multiple parts of the body at the same time.

One of the key features of the new method is its ability to uncover polygenic regulation of gene expression, where multiple genetic variants work together to control gene expression. The researchers also showed that their method can identify secondary trans-eQTLs, which are genetic variants that affect gene expression in other parts of the body.

The new method has the potential to uncover complex genetic regulatory mechanisms that control global gene expression and can be applied to other model systems and humans. It can also be used to analyze multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes, making it a valuable tool for understanding the genetic basis of complex diseases.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the process of extrinsic apoptosis, a type of cell death triggered by external signals such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TRAIL. The model reveals that extrinsic apoptosis is controlled by a unique "variable-delay, snap-action" switch, which allows cells to choose between life and death. This switch is characterized by a long and variable delay before the activation of downstream effector caspases, followed by a rapid and sudden progression to cell death.

The model was trained using experimental data from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblotting, and accurately reproduces the behavior of normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL. Analysis of the model shows that the duration of the delay before effector caspase activation is determined by the activity of initiator caspase-8 and the rates of other reactions downstream of the TRAIL receptor. The sudden activation of effector caspases is achieved through reactions involved in the permeabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and the relocalization of proteins such as Smac.

The researchers found that the interactions among Bcl-2 family members, the partitioning of Smac from its binding partner XIAP, and the mechanics of pore assembly are critical for snap-action control. The model suggests that the dynamics of initiator caspase and effector caspase substrate cleavage raise questions about where in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway a steady increase in caspase-8 activity is converted into a snap-action downstream signal.
Listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium that can infect the placenta during pregnancy, posing a risk to the fetus. To understand how this bacterium breaches the placental barrier, researchers studied the protein InlP, which is secreted by Listeria monocytogenes. They found that InlP binds to a human protein called afadin, which is involved in cell-cell junctions. This interaction is crucial for the bacterium's ability to cross the placental barrier. The researchers created a crystal structure of InlP, which revealed a unique feature that allows it to bind to afadin. They also found that Listeria monocytogenes mutants lacking InlP were unable to form actin-rich protrusions on the basal face of epithelial cells, a necessary step for crossing the placental barrier. Furthermore, a specific deletion in InlP that disrupts its interaction with afadin also impaired the bacterium's ability to cross the barrier. The study suggests that InlP targets cytosolic afadin to promote Listeria monocytogenes transcytosis across the basal face of epithelial monolayers, which may contribute to the crossing of the basement membrane during placental infection. The findings provide new insights into how Listeria monocytogenes breaches the placental barrier and may have implications for understanding the pathogenesis of placental infections.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the proteome of Treponema pallidum ssp. pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis. Using mass spectrometry techniques, they identified 6033 peptides corresponding to 557 unique proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the global T. pallidum proteome to date. The study used complementary mass spectrometry techniques, including multidimensional peptide separation and protein identification via MALDI-TOF/TOF and ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry, to analyze T. pallidum ssp. pallidum DAL-1 strain bacteria isolated from rabbits. The detected proteins were characterized according to their predicted biological function and localization, with half allocated into a wide range of functional categories. One hundred fourteen of the detected proteins were previously annotated as hypothetical or uncharacterized proteins, with 106 of these being described for the first time at the protein level. The study also identified 116 potential membrane proteins, including 16 with evidence supporting outer membrane localization. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free spectral counting methods, showing a low correlation with previous microarray signal data. This research provides valuable insights into in vivo T. pallidum protein expression, paving the way for a better understanding of the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.
Researchers have mapped the free energy landscape of Protein Kinase A (PKA) inhibition and activation using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis. PKA is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotic cells. The study focused on the tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and CBD-B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (RIα). The researchers found that in the absence of cAMP, the PKA-RIα region samples four states with a nearly degenerate free-energy landscape, where each CBD accesses both active and inactive conformations with comparable populations.

The study proposes a "double conformational selection" model for the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA RIα. According to this model, the binding of cAMP selectively stabilizes the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, which require both cAMP and a specific residue (W260) contributed by CBD-B. The inter-CBD interface is essential for full activation of PKA, as it occludes C-subunit recognition sites within CBD-A. The study also found that the two structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in their residual dynamics profiles, suggesting that conservation of structure does not necessarily imply conservation of dynamics.

The research provides new insights into the dynamic conformational equilibria of CBD-A and -B and sheds light on the critical role of CBD-B dynamics in modulating the control exerted by CBD-A. The findings have implications for understanding the cAMP-dependent activation of PKA and its role in various cellular processes, such as regulation of the immune system and cell proliferation.
ISG15, a protein induced by interferon, plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity. Researchers studied the effects of ISG15 on macrophages, a type of immune cell, after they were infected with the vaccinia virus. They found that ISG15 helps regulate the function of mitochondria, the cell's energy-producing structures, in macrophages. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation were altered in macrophages lacking ISG15, leading to higher levels of reactive oxygen species and lower production of adenosine triphosphate, a molecule that provides energy to cells. ISG15 also influences the polarization of macrophages, which affects their ability to fight off infections. Macrophages lacking ISG15 showed a pro-inflammatory response, but were unable to produce nitric oxide, a molecule that helps kill viruses. As a result, the virus was able to replicate more easily in these cells. In contrast, macrophages with ISG15 produced more nitric oxide and were better able to fight off the virus. The study suggests that ISG15 plays a critical role in regulating mitochondrial function and macrophage polarization, and that its absence can make cells more susceptible to viral infection. The findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of antiviral immunity and the role of ISG15 in protecting against viral infections.
HIV-1's Vpu protein plays a crucial role in the virus's replication by degrading its cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing the release of viral particles. Vpu achieves this by binding to the βTrCP subunit of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex. However, researchers have found that Vpu escapes degradation while inhibiting the degradation of βTrCP's natural targets, such as β-catenin and IκBα. A novel phosphorylation site in Vpu, serine 61, has been identified as a key factor in its degradation. When Vpu is phosphorylated at this site, it undergoes degradation through a βTrCP-independent pathway. This process is essential for regulating Vpu's fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. The conservation of the Vpu degradation determinant, despite its negative effect on virion release, suggests that it may play a role in overall HIV-1 fitness. Mutating Vpu's serine 61 to a non-phosphorylatable residue stabilizes the protein and increases the release of HIV-1 particles. This finding highlights a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate and has implications for understanding HIV-1's replication and pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated how the development of individual tissues, such as the wing, is coordinated with the overall development of the body in the fruit fly Drosophila. They proposed two hypotheses: that tissue patterning is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time, or that it aligns at specific developmental milestones. To test these hypotheses, the researchers developed a staging scheme for the wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae based on the expression of key patterning genes. They linked this scheme to three whole-body developmental events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupariation.

The study found that the expression pattern in the wing disc always aligned at moulting and pupariation, indicating that these events represent developmental milestones. However, between these milestones, the progression of pattern showed greater variability in response to changes in temperature and alterations in physiology. The researchers also found that discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning stage, suggesting that wandering does not appear to be a developmental milestone.

The study's findings reveal that tissue patterning remains robust against environmental and physiological perturbations by aligning at developmental milestones. The research provides new insights into how the development of individual tissues is coordinated with the body as a whole, and highlights the importance of developmental milestones in ensuring the robustness of the adult phenotype.
In highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae, early endosomes play a crucial role in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the relationship between these two processes is not well understood. Researchers have discovered that the ESCRT regulator Did2 is essential for maintaining the balance between endocytic trafficking and long-distance transport in fungal hyphae of Ustilago maydis. Without Did2, early endosomes become defective, leading to impaired vacuolar targeting and reduced processive long-distance transport. Additionally, the late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, resulting in disturbed processive movement. Furthermore, the endosomal mRNP linker protein Upa1 is hardly present on endosomes, leading to defects in long-distance mRNA transport. The study reveals that Did2 coordinates the precise maturation of endosomes, providing the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. This research highlights the importance of the ESCRT regulator Did2 in maintaining the balance between endocytic trafficking and long-distance transport in highly polarized cells.
Scientists have studied two types of riboswitches, which are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression in bacteria. These riboswitches, found in the bacteria Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnificus, both bind to the molecule adenine, but they control gene expression in different ways. The Bacillus subtilis riboswitch, called pbuE, regulates gene expression at the transcriptional level, while the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch, called add, regulates gene expression at the translational level.

Research has shown that the two riboswitches have different properties and operate under different regulatory regimes. The Bacillus subtilis riboswitch requires adenine binding to be present during transcription to function, while the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch can bind to adenine after transcription is complete and still regulate translation. The study also found that the rate of transcription is critical for the Bacillus subtilis riboswitch to function efficiently.

In contrast, the Vibrio vulnificus riboswitch can regulate translation even when transcription and translation are uncoupled. This suggests that the nature of gene regulation control, whether it is transcription or translation, plays a significant role in riboswitch regulatory mechanisms. Overall, the study highlights the complexity and diversity of riboswitches and their role in regulating gene expression in bacteria.
Researchers have discovered a common pattern of gene expression in two types of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. This pattern, called primer-dependent initiation (PDI), involves the use of a short RNA molecule, or primer, to start the process of gene expression. The study found that PDI occurs mainly during the stationary phase of growth, when the bacteria are not actively dividing, and is not detected during the exponential phase of growth, when the bacteria are actively dividing.

The researchers used a technique called 5' RNA-seq to analyze the RNA molecules produced by the bacteria and found that PDI is preferentially apparent at certain types of gene promoters. They also found that the pattern of PDI is similar in both E. coli and V. cholerae, suggesting that it may be a widespread phenomenon in bacteria.

The study suggests that PDI plays a role in regulating biofilm formation in E. coli, which is a type of bacterial community that forms on surfaces. The researchers propose that a growth phase-dependent process generates the primers used in PDI, leading to the preferential production of certain types of RNA molecules. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of gene expression in bacteria and suggests that PDI may be an important regulatory mechanism in many types of bacteria.
Researchers investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis plants. Imprinted genes are genes that are expressed by a single parental allele, and their expression is controlled by DNA or histone methylation. The study found that parental genome imbalance deregulated the expression of two imprinted genes, FIS2 and PHE1, in an antagonistic manner. This means that an increased dosage of maternal genomes repressed the expression of FIS2, while an increased dosage of paternal genomes enhanced the expression of PHE1. The study also found that increased dosage of inactive alleles caused a loss of imprinting of FIS2 and another imprinted gene, MEA. However, the changes in PHE1 and MEA expression could not be fully explained by the corresponding fluctuations in FIS2 expression. The study suggests that parental genome dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting through mechanisms that are independent of known regulators of imprinting. The findings do not support simple models derived from the parental conflict hypothesis, which proposes that parental genome imbalances are directly mirrored by antagonistic regulations of imprinted genes. The study provides experimental evidence for the parental conflict theory in plants and highlights the complexity of the network of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles of imprinted genes in response to parental dosage imbalance.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the biophysical mechanisms behind brain rhythms, but the functional role of these oscillations remains unclear. This study focuses on what brain rhythms reveal about functional brain connectivity, rather than how they emerge or whether they are necessary for neural function. The researchers used mathematical techniques to reverse-engineer network architectures that generate characteristic dynamics of actual brains, including spindles and sharp waves. They found that reconstructed networks display similar topological features and dynamics, suggesting that brain rhythms convey significant information about functional connectivity. The study also reconstructed networks modeling diseased brains, such as those with epilepsy and schizophrenia, and found consistent alterations in functional connectivity and dynamics. The complexity of the network, as quantified by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, was found to be a good indicator of brain fitness, with virtual brains modeling diseased states displaying lower complexity than those modeling normal neural function. The study's findings have implications for the neurobiology of health and disease, and suggest that brain rhythms can be used to infer functional connectivity and potentially diagnose neurological disorders.
Researchers analyzed the genetic makeup of over 1,300 Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to better understand the population structure of Hispanics in the United States. They used genetic data from nearly 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify the ancestral origins of the participants, who self-identified as coming from Central America, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico, and South America.

The study found that the first two principal components (PCs) of ancestry indicated Caucasian, African, and Native American origins, while the third and fourth PCs revealed a geographic axis that separated MESA Mexican samples from those from Central and South America. The researchers then used k-means clustering to identify four subgroups within the MESA Hispanic cohort, which closely matched the participants' self-identification as primarily Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican.

To demonstrate the importance of considering population substructure in genetic association studies, the researchers conducted pooled and stratified association analysis of triglycerides for selected SNPs in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions. They found statistically significant evidence of genetic association in both genes, which had previously been reported in Caucasians but not in Hispanic populations. This study highlights the need to account for genetic heterogeneity and population substructure in genetic association studies of Hispanic populations in the United States.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the Elongator complex in maintaining genome stability and transcriptional silencing in cells. The Elongator complex is a group of six proteins that work together to modify histones, which are the building blocks of chromatin. Histones play a crucial role in DNA replication, DNA repair, and gene transcription. The study found that the Elongator complex interacts with a protein called PCNA, which is involved in DNA replication and repair. When the Elongator complex is missing or not functioning properly, cells are more sensitive to DNA damage and have trouble silencing certain genes. The researchers also found that the Elongator complex works independently of another protein called Asf1, which is involved in DNA replication-coupled nucleosome assembly. The study suggests that the Elongator complex plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability and transcriptional silencing, and that it does so by interacting with PCNA. The findings have implications for our understanding of how cells maintain their genetic material and respond to DNA damage. The study also highlights the importance of histone modifications and nucleosome assembly in regulating chromatin structures during gene transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Overall, the research provides new insights into the complex processes involved in maintaining genome stability and transcriptional silencing in cells.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the process of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications. This process, known as document triage, involves retrieving relevant publications for curation from databases such as PubMed. However, the current query-based method often yields unsatisfactory results, with low precision and recall. To address this issue, the researchers proposed a machine-learning assisted triage method using deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). They trained the models using previously curated publications from two databases, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the NHGRI-EBI GWAS Catalog, as a gold-standard dataset. The trained models were then used to classify and rank new publications for curation. The researchers applied their method to the real-world manual curation process of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog and demonstrated that it outperformed the current query-based triage methods, improving efficiency and enriching curated content. The method achieved a precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than the current query-based triage methods of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the GWAS Catalog, respectively, without compromising recall. The results show that the machine learning-based method can make the triage process more efficient, allowing human curators to focus on more challenging tasks to improve the quality of knowledge bases.
Researchers investigated the link between genetic mutations in the KCNJ2 gene and atrial arrhythmias, specifically short QT syndrome type 3 (SQT3), which is associated with atrial fibrillation. They used computer models of the human atria to study the effects of two specific mutations, D172N and E299V, on the heart's electrical activity. The models showed that both mutations shortened the time it takes for the heart to recover between beats, making it more susceptible to arrhythmias. The D172N mutation reduced the time it takes for the heart to recover, while the E299V mutation had a more complex effect on the heart's electrical activity. The researchers found that blocking certain ion channels in the heart, specifically IK1 and IKr, was effective in terminating arrhythmias associated with the D172N mutation. However, for the E299V mutation, blocking IKr alone may be a safer alternative. Combining the block of IK1 and IKur produced a synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both forms of SQT3. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying atrial arrhythmias in SQT3 and suggest potential pharmacological strategies for managing the condition. The study highlights the importance of considering the complex interactions between genetic mutations and the heart's electrical heterogeneities in understanding and treating atrial arrhythmias.
Researchers investigated whether adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) can help prevent cardiac damage in mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. Chagas disease is a complex condition that affects millions of people in Central and South America and is becoming more common in developed countries due to non-vectorial transmission.

In the study, mice were infected with T. cruzi and then injected with ASC three days later. The cells remained in the abdominal cavity for up to nine days and mostly migrated to the abdominal or subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. The researchers found that the ASC injection significantly reduced blood parasitemia, or the presence of parasites in the blood, and decreased cardiac tissue inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 days post-infection.

The study also showed that the ASC-treated mice had an anti-inflammatory response in the heart, which helped protect the organ from damage. In contrast, splenocytes, or immune cells from the spleen, produced a pro-inflammatory response, which is important for controlling parasite replication. However, the ASC-treated mice had higher levels of IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine.

At 60 days post-infection, magnetic resonance imaging revealed that the right ventricle of the heart was protected from dilation in the ASC-treated mice. The researchers concluded that the injection of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents right ventricular remodeling through the modulation of immune responses, which helps control parasite burden and protects the heart from damage.
Researchers have identified two new compounds, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, that are more effective than the existing compound Retro-2cycl in controlling Leishmania infections. Leishmania parasites infect mammalian cells and reside in specialized compartments called parasitophorous vacuoles. Retro-2cycl was previously shown to reduce the size of these compartments and lower parasite numbers. The new compounds, DHQZ 36 and DHQZ 36.1, were found to be more potent than Retro-2cycl in limiting Leishmania infections in macrophages, with EC50 values of 13.63+/-2.58μM and 10.57+/-2.66μM, respectively. These values are significantly lower than the EC50 of Retro-2cycl, which was 40.15μM. Additionally, the new compounds can kill Leishmania parasites in axenic cultures, which is a desirable attribute for a drug to treat Leishmania infections. The compounds also reversed the inhibition of IL-6 release by infected cells after LPS activation. In contrast to Retro-2cycl, which is Leishmania-static, the new compounds are Leishmania-cidal, meaning they can kill the parasites. These findings validate and extend the published structure-activity relationship analyses of Retro-2cycl and suggest that the new compounds may be effective in treating Leishmania infections.
Researchers used a computational method to study how nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, interact with transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate gene expression. They focused on the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1a (AML-1a) transcription factor, which plays a role in immune gene expression. The study found that AML-1a binding sites in the Ly49 gene family, which is involved in the immune system, have fewer nucleosomes than other parts of the genome. This suggests that nucleosomes may play a role in regulating Ly49 gene expression. The researchers confirmed this finding in a cell line that naturally expresses Ly49, where they found that AML-1a binding sites are depleted of nucleosomes in expressed Ly49 genes compared to inactive genes. This implies that nucleosome positioning may be a mechanism that affects Ly49 expression in living cells. The study also found that many other transcription factors may be sensitive to nucleosomes, similar to AML-1a. The researchers propose that their method for predicting nucleosome sensitivity could be useful for understanding how nucleosomes regulate gene expression in general. Further research is needed to determine whether AML-1a's sensitivity to nucleosomes is specific to the Ly49 gene family or if it applies to other genes as well.
Researchers have identified a crucial step in the activation of CDK4, a protein that plays a key role in cell cycle progression. Specifically, they found that the phosphorylation of CDK4 at the T172 site is a highly regulated step that determines its activity. This phosphorylation is typically catalyzed by CDK7, a kinase that is constitutively active in animals. However, the researchers discovered that CDK7 inhibition prevents the activating phosphorylation of CDK4, but this effect is partly dependent on the binding of CDK4 to p21, a protein that regulates cell cycle progression. In response to CDK7 inhibition, p21 binding to CDK4 increases, and the most abundant phosphorylation of p21, at the S130 site, disappears. This phosphorylation is catalyzed by both CDK4 and CDK2. The researchers found that the S130A mutation of p21 prevents the activating CDK4 phosphorylation, and inhibition of CDK4/6 and CDK2 impairs phosphorylations of both p21 and p21-bound CDK4. The study reveals a novel CDK7-dependent positive feedback loop mediated by p21 phosphorylation by CDK4 and CDK2 to sustain CDK4 activation, pRb inactivation, and restriction point passage. The findings suggest that CDK7 plays a crucial but indirect role in the phosphorylation and activation of CDK4 and CDK6, and that there are CDK4-activating kinases other than CDK7.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/MMD1 that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression during male meiosis in plants, specifically in the model organism Arabidopsis. Meiosis is a critical process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction. In Arabidopsis, DUET/MMD1 acts as a transcriptional regulator, controlling the expression of genes involved in meiotic cell cycle transitions and spindle organization. The study found that DUET/MMD1 binds to a specific histone modification, H3K4me2, which is essential for its function. Notably, DUET/MMD1 expression is confined to the diplotene stage of prophase I, a specific stage of meiosis. The researchers identified two genes, TDM1 and JAS, as targets of DUET/MMD1, with TDM1 being a direct target. TDM1 is required for meiotic cell cycle transitions, and its expression is directly dependent on DUET/MMD1. The study also found that DUET/MMD1 is required for proper microtubule organization during meiosis II, independently of its function in meiosis I. The results suggest that DUET/MMD1 plays a critical role in regulating meiotic gene expression and cell cycle transitions during male meiosis in plants, and that transcription of meiotic genes is under stage-specific control. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of meiotic gene regulation in plants and highlights the importance of DUET/MMD1 in specifying distinct male and female meiotic programs.
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by fragile X premutation rCGG repeats. Previous studies have shown that these repeats can cause neurodegeneration and that certain proteins, such as Pur α and hnRNP A2/B1, can modulate this process. Researchers used a proteomic approach to identify over 100 proteins that interact with Pur α, including Rm62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase. They found that fragile X premutation rCGG repeats decrease the expression of Rm62 post-transcriptionally, leading to the nuclear accumulation of Hsp70 transcript and other mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. This accumulation is likely due to impaired nuclear export of these mRNAs. The study suggests that this abnormal accumulation of mRNAs contributes to FXTAS pathogenesis. The researchers also found that reducing the expression of Rm62 in Drosophila flies significantly reduced their viability, indicating a strong genetic interaction between Rm62 and rCGG repeat-mediated neuronal cell death. The study's findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying FXTAS and suggest that impaired nuclear export of specific mRNAs, such as Hsp70, may play a key role in the disorder's pathogenesis.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria, forms complex communities called biofilms that are encased in an extracellular matrix. This matrix is made up of a mix of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins, but the exact process of how it forms and holds bacteria together is not well understood. Researchers studied the development of P. aeruginosa biofilms and found that a specific polysaccharide called Psl plays a crucial role in forming the matrix. During the early stages of biofilm development, Psl is anchored to the surface of bacterial cells in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and the assembly of the matrix. As the biofilm matures, Psl accumulates on the periphery of microcolonies, creating a cavity in the center. This cavity is where dead cells and extracellular DNA (eDNA) are concentrated. Deletion of genes that control cell death and autolysis affects the formation of the matrix cavity and microcolony dispersion. The researchers found that Psl is a key component of the biofilm matrix, serving as a scaffolding material that holds bacteria together. This discovery opens up new avenues for developing therapeutics to combat biofilm-related complications. The study provides a mechanism for how P. aeruginosa builds a matrix and a cavity to free a portion of cells for seeding dispersal, shedding light on the complex process of biofilm development.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with the worst prognosis among solid malignancies. To improve treatment outcomes, researchers use patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) as preclinical models to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential. However, these models must accurately represent the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. A recent study conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. The researchers developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. The study found that tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlighted previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. The study also found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes, but ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Overall, the study highlights that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.
Researchers conducted a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic factors contributing to breast cancer in East Asian women. The study included 19,091 cases and 20,606 controls from China, Korea, and Japan. After analyzing over 690,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the researchers identified a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus represented by SNP rs9485372, located near the TGF-β activated kinase (TAB2) gene on chromosome 6q25.1. This SNP showed a consistent association with breast cancer risk across all four stages of the study, with a P-value of 3.8×10−12 in the combined analysis of all samples. The researchers also identified two other possible susceptibility loci, represented by SNPs rs9383951 and rs7107217, located in the ESR1 gene and 11q24.3, respectively. These findings provide strong evidence for a novel breast cancer susceptibility locus and suggest that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of breast cancer in East Asian women.
Researchers studied 230 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa with cryptococcal meningitis, a major cause of mortality in the developing world. They used a technique called multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) to analyze the genetic diversity of the isolates. The study found high levels of genetic diversity among the isolates, with 50 different sequence types identified, including 18 new ones. This diversity was higher than what has been seen in isolates from other parts of the world.

The researchers also found that the genetic lineage of the fungus was associated with clinical outcome, with patients infected with the VNB lineage having a significantly worse survival rate. This was true even after adjusting for known prognostic indicators and treatment regimen. Additionally, the study found that the VNII lineage had increased laccase activity and ex vivo CSF survival, indicating a more virulent phenotype.

The study's findings suggest that Cryptococcus neoformans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, meaning that different genetic lineages can have different levels of virulence. The researchers also found that the genetic diversity of the fungus in South Africa is structured differently than in other parts of the world, which could have implications for understanding the risks posed by different ecotypes of the fungus. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic diversity of Cryptococcus neoformans and its relationship to clinical outcome in HIV-positive patients in South Africa.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as the last component of the newly evolved signal transduction pathway that regulates the pheromone response of the white cell phenotype in Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen. This discovery provides a comprehensive description of the pheromone response pathway in the white cell phenotype of C. albicans and sheds light on how new signal transduction pathways may evolve. The pathway appears to have been derived from three different ancestral programs still functional in C. albicans, including the opaque pheromone response pathway, the filamentation pathway, and an ancestral biofilm process. The upstream portion of the pathway, including signals, receptors, and the MAP kinase cascade, was derived from the opaque pheromone response pathway. Tec1, the transcription factor targeted by the MAP kinase pathway, was derived from the filamentation pathway. The white-specific downstream target genes were derived from the ancestral biofilm process. This evolution of the pheromone response pathway in C. albicans may provide a paradigm for how new signal transduction pathways evolve.
Researchers investigated the variation in genomic GC-content among 149 bacterial species, which ranges from less than 20% to over 70%. They tested the hypothesis that this variation is due to differences in mutation patterns between bacteria. The study found a significant excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations in GC-rich bacteria, but not in AT-rich bacteria. This excess of GC→AT mutations cannot be explained by mutation bias, as it would imply that GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, which is unsustainable. The researchers also ruled out translational selection and biased gene conversion as possible explanations, as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich and the excess of GC→AT SNPs is observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. As a result, the study concludes that there is selection to increase synonymous GC-content in many species. Since synonymous GC-content is highly correlated with genomic GC-content, the researchers further conclude that there is selection on genomic base composition in many bacteria. The study's findings suggest that the variation in genomic GC-content among bacteria is not solely due to mutation bias, but rather is influenced by selective pressures.
Researchers have developed a new tool to help control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in Kenya. These infections, caused by parasitic worms, are a major public health problem in the country. The tool uses data from 34 years of surveys to create maps that show where STH infections are most common. The maps are based on the prevalence of three types of STH: hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoides, and Trichuris trichiura.

The researchers used a statistical method called Bayesian space-time geostatistics to create the maps. They combined data from 106,370 individuals from 945 surveys to estimate the probability of STH infection in different areas of Kenya. The maps show that in 2009, most areas of the country had low levels of STH infection, but there were hotspots around Lake Victoria and the coast where the infection was more common.

The researchers estimated that 2.8 million school-age children live in areas where mass treatment is needed to control STH infections. They also found that a quarter of Kenya's school-aged children live in areas with high levels of STH infection. The tool can be used to refine decision-making in helminth control programs as they become more effective in reducing infection levels.
Researchers investigated the role of innate immune cells, specifically invariant NKT (iNKT) cells, in fighting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. They found that iNKT cells can recognize and respond to Mtb-infected macrophages, producing interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and killing the bacteria. This response was dependent on the presence of CD1d molecules on the surface of infected macrophages and the cytokines IL-12 and IL-18. When iNKT cells were transferred into mice infected with Mtb, they significantly reduced the bacterial burden in the lungs. This suggests that iNKT cells have a direct bactericidal effect against Mtb. The researchers also found that iNKT cells can control Mtb replication even in the absence of synthetic ligands, such as α-galactosylceramide. This is the first evidence that CD1d-restricted NKT cells can mediate protection against Mtb in vivo. The study provides new insights into the role of innate immunity in fighting Mtb infection and highlights the potential of iNKT cells as a target for developing new treatments against tuberculosis.
Researchers studied how a specific enzyme, Tgl, helps stabilize the protein coat of Bacillus subtilis endospores. Tgl is a transglutaminase that forms covalent bonds between proteins. Unlike other transglutaminases, Tgl is produced in an active form, which raises questions about how its activity is controlled. The study found that Tgl's substrates, which are proteins assembled onto the spore coat before Tgl is produced, play a crucial role in controlling the enzyme's activity. The substrates guide Tgl to the surface of the developing spore, where it cross-links pre-assembled protein complexes. The researchers identified specific sites on the substrates and Tgl that are important for this process. They also found that Tgl becomes part of the cross-linked products, suggesting that it is "spotwelding" the pre-assembled complexes together. The study suggests that the dependency of Tgl on its substrates allows for precise control over the timing, location, and extent of its activity, ensuring that the spore coat is properly fortified. This mechanism may also be used in other spore-forming bacteria to control the activity of Tgl orthologues. The findings provide new insights into the complex process of spore coat assembly and the role of transglutaminases in stabilizing protein assemblies.
A study in southern Lao PDR aimed to map the distribution of Opisthorchis viverrini, a food-borne parasite that causes biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma, and identify risk factors for infection. The researchers conducted a survey in 51 villages in Champasack province, collecting data on demographics, socioeconomic status, water supply, sanitation, and behavior, as well as remotely sensed environmental data. They used Bayesian geostatistical models to analyze the data and predict the prevalence of O. viverrini infection at non-surveyed locations.

The study found that 61.1% of 3,371 participants were infected with O. viverrini. Risk factors for infection included age, Lao Loum ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation (such as rice farmer, fisherman, and animal breeder), and unsafe drinking water source. On the other hand, history of praziquantel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater bodies were found to be protective factors. The study also identified two different risk profiles: low risk in the mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor.

The researchers created a risk map of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province, which can be used to target control efforts. The study suggests that O. viverrini infection is strongly associated with exposure to the second intermediate host fish, human behavior, and culture, and that high transmission is sustained by the lack of sanitation. The study's findings emphasize the importance of environmental factors in predicting O. viverrini prevalence and highlight the need for urgent public health interventions to address the high prevalence of O. viverrini infection in Champasack province.
In the city of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, drains play a significant role in the larval development of mosquitoes that transmit lymphatic filariasis and malaria. The city's extensive drain network, often with inadequate water flow and blocked by waste, creates an ideal breeding ground for Anopheles and Culex larvae. A study analyzed data from the Urban Malaria Control Program and a special drain survey conducted in 2006 to understand the importance of drains as larval habitats. The results showed that over 70% of larval habitats in Dar es Salaam are human-made, with drains being the most common type, accounting for 42% of all aquatic habitats. Drains with stagnant water were found to have a higher presence of Anopheles and Culex larvae compared to those with flowing water. Vegetation was also found to be positively associated with the presence of mosquito larvae. The study suggests that restoring and maintaining drains in Dar es Salaam could eliminate over 40% of potential mosquito larval habitats that are currently treated with larvicides. The findings highlight the importance of human-made larval habitats for both lymphatic filariasis and malaria vectors, underscoring the need for a synergy between ongoing control efforts for these diseases.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to changes in lipid-related metabolites in the endoplasmic reticulum of infected cells, which are associated with the formation of viral replicative complexes. Research has shown that DENV infection inhibits the phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), an enzyme involved in cholesterol production, resulting in a cholesterol-enriched cellular environment that favors viral replication. This study found that DENV infection significantly increases HMGCR activity, which is associated with the inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation by metformin reduced HMGCR activity, suggesting that AMPK inactivation mediates the enhanced activity of HMGCR. The study also found that HMGCR and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, suggesting a role for HMGCR and AMPK activity in the formation of DENV replicative complexes. Metformin and lovastatin, an HMGCR inhibitor, altered this co-localization and replicative complexes formation, supporting the idea that active HMGCR is required for replicative complexes formation. Furthermore, metformin showed a significant dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV-infected cells, while compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, augmented viral genome copies and the percentage of infected cells. These findings suggest that DENV infection increases HMGCR activity through AMPK inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol levels in the endoplasmic reticulum necessary for replicative complexes formation. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms involved in host lipid metabolism during DENV replication and identifies new potential antiviral targets for DENV replication.
Researchers used computer simulations to study the process of tRNA translocation on the ribosome, a crucial step in protein synthesis. They created a detailed model of the ribosome, consisting of 2.1 million atoms, and simulated its movement over a period of 1.3 microseconds. This allowed them to analyze the energy landscape of the ribosome and identify specific regions that undergo coordinated movements during translocation.

The study found that the ribosome's movement can be broken down into two types of motions: slow, large-scale collective movements and rapid local fluctuations. The researchers identified groups of residues that undergo collective rotations and displacements, which are essential for tRNA translocation. These motions include the rotation of the 30S body, the swiveling of the 30S head, and the displacement of the tRNA.

By analyzing the diffusion of these motions, the researchers were able to establish a connection between the energy landscape of the ribosome and the kinetics of tRNA translocation. This connection allows for a more detailed understanding of the process and provides a framework for interpreting experimental data. The study's findings suggest that the ribosome's movement can be described as a "thermal ratchet machine," where random energetic fluctuations lead to large-scale diffusive rearrangements.

The research provides new insights into the dynamics of the ribosome and the process of tRNA translocation, which is essential for protein synthesis. The study's framework can be applied to other biological processes, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying energy landscapes and kinetics.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC), a rare type of thyroid cancer. They analyzed tissue samples from 84 MTC patients and found 101 genetic mutations in 18 different genes. The most common mutation was in the ret proto-oncogene, which occurred in 47 cases. Other frequently mutated genes included those encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threonine kinase 11, and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog. The researchers also looked for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements and found two cases with ALK fusions, specifically glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK. The EML4-ALK fusion was found in a metastatic MTC case that showed a dramatic response to an ALK inhibitor, crizotinib. This suggests that the EML4-ALK fusion may be a potential driver mutation and a valid target for ALK inhibitors. Additionally, the GFPT1-ALK fusion may be a potential candidate for molecular target therapy. The study's findings provide new insights into the genetic landscape of MTC and highlight the potential for targeted therapies in treating this type of cancer.
Researchers conducted a study in Malda district, West Bengal, India, to understand the role of asymptomatic leishmaniasis in the spread of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). They screened 2,603 people from eight tribal villages and found 185 individuals with antileishmanial antibodies. Of these, 96 had a history of VL or PKDL, while 89 did not. The researchers classified 79 individuals as asymptomatic leishmaniasis cases and 10 as active VL cases, with a ratio of 7.9:1.

The asymptomatic cases were followed up for three years, during which 8 out of 77 (10.39%) developed symptoms of VL or PKDL, and 62 out of 77 (80.52%) showed sero-conversion. Seven individuals (9.09%) remained seropositive after three years. The study found that asymptomatic individuals can develop symptoms of VL or PKDL at any time up to three years after the initial screening. The researchers also noted that the presence of asymptomatic cases does not necessarily mean that an area is free from leishmaniasis, as symptomatic cases can appear even after three years.

The study highlights the importance of addressing asymptomatic cases in the VL elimination program initiated by three Asian countries. The researchers suggest that asymptomatic infected individuals need attention to prevent the spread of the disease and potential future epidemics. The study found a prevalence rate of 3.16% asymptomatic leishmanial infection among the healthy population screened, which is lower than previous studies in Bihar.
Researchers have developed a new technique called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genetic rearrangements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. These rearrangements, known as gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs), can lead to genetic diseases and cancer. The study found that the introduction of a repetitive retrotransposon called Ty912 onto a nonessential chromosome arm of S. cerevisiae led to increased genome instability, primarily due to the formation of monocentric nonreciprocal translocations.

Using MLPA, the researchers analyzed a large number of GCRs and found that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty912 was nonrandom. They discovered that the majority of these translocations were mediated by only six translocation targets on four different chromosomes, despite the presence of 254 potential Ty-related translocation targets in the S. cerevisiae genome. The study also found that the majority of Ty912-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, but a significant number of nonreciprocal translocations were mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty1 elements.

Furthermore, the researchers found that defects in the acetylation of histone H3 lysine residue 56 (H3K56) resulted in increased accumulation of GCRs and whole-chromosome duplications, leading to aneuploidy. The study suggests that MLPA is a versatile technique for the rapid analysis of GCRs and can facilitate the genetic analysis of the pathways that prevent and promote GCRs and aneuploidy.
Researchers have developed a new method for predicting how proteins interact with each other, a process known as protein docking. This method, called Semi-Definite programming-based Underestimation (SDU), uses a mathematical approach to find the most likely position and orientation of two proteins in space. The method is based on the idea that the interaction between proteins is driven by a "free energy funnel," a concept similar to how proteins fold into their native shape.

The SDU method uses a combination of rigid body motions and flexibility of the proteins' side chains to find the optimal position and orientation of the proteins. However, applying this method directly to the space of rotations and translations is challenging due to its geometry. To overcome this, the researchers introduced a new strategy that separates the search space into three independent variables: side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and five angular descriptors of the relative orientations of the molecules.

This new approach vastly improves the efficiency of the search and allows the method to explore the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes that correspond to local free energy minima. The results show that the SDU strategy can generate docking predictions with high accuracy, achieving an approximately 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The method also demonstrates that the free energy landscape of the complex is a funnel in a reasonably broad neighborhood of the native state, supporting the model of macromolecular association that proceeds through a series of collisions.
