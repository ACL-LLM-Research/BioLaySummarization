Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of cases of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis (gHAT), also known as sleeping sickness, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the past two decades. Despite this progress, pockets of infection remain, and it is essential to assess which regions are on track for elimination and where intervention efforts should be focused. To address this, a stochastic mathematical model was developed to capture the dynamics of gHAT in the DRC. The model was applied to 16 health areas in the Mosango health zone in Kwilu province, which has approximately 10,000 people. The analysis used a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology to fit the model to the data. The results showed that the health area of Kinzamba II, which accounts for one-third of the health zone's cases, is expected to have the latest expected year for elimination of transmission (EoT). The study also found that fitting a deterministic version of the model using MCMC had faster computation times than fitting the stochastic model, but produced similar results. This suggests that using deterministic fits for efficiency and stochastic projections to capture parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations is a viable approach. The study provides a new framework for calibrating and projecting future gHAT infections for various intervention scenarios, which can be applied to other regions in the DRC.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze tumor microenvironments (TMEs) to better understand cancer and predict patient outcomes. TMEs contain a vast amount of information about a patient's cancer, including the cellular composition and spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cells. By exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups, scientists can identify specific interactions that are useful in making predictions about patient survival and treatment success with emerging immunotherapies.

The new approach uses spatial K functions to summarize the relationships between different cell types in the TME, and then applies functional data analysis and random forest models to predict outcomes and identify important spatial relationships. This approach was tested on simulated data and found to be effective in identifying important spatial interactions while controlling the false discovery rate.

The method was also applied to real data from triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients, obtained through multiplexed ion beam imaging. In the triple negative breast cancer data, the approach was used to compare two groups of tumors based on the degree of tumor-immune cell interactions. The results showed that the method was able to identify significant differences between the two groups in the distribution of cell phenotypes and protein antigens.

The new approach is publicly available in a companion R package called "funkycells" and has the potential to improve our understanding of cancer and guide therapeutic interventions. By analyzing the spatial relationships between different cell types in the TME, scientists can identify specific interactions that are predictive of patient outcomes and develop more effective treatments for cancer.
Researchers studied how abnormal synchronization in the brain can impair its function, a phenomenon observed in various brain disorders. They used computational models to investigate how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure interact and evolve during synchronization and desynchronization processes. The study focused on the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) and homeostatic structural plasticity (hSP), on network behavior.

The researchers created a network of excitatory neurons with varying synaptic weights and structural plasticity mechanisms, including STDP, hSP, and a combination of both. They found that structural reorganization can significantly enhance network synchrony, particularly when weaker connections are eliminated through weight-dependent pruning. This process allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections than in randomly structured networks.

The study also showed that the strengthening of connections between neurons with higher firing rates and those with lower rates, followed by the removal of weak connections, enables strong synchrony. This activity-led network reorganization leads to the emergence of degree-frequency and degree-degree correlations, as well as a mixture of degree assortativity.

The researchers compared the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model with those in models that combined STDP and hSP or STDP and structural plasticity. They found that the latter models require significantly higher stimulus intensities to achieve long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future studies on inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms in brain disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, using invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of some animals, such as planarians, to regenerate large parts of their nervous system after injury. This process requires the coordinated regeneration of various types of neurons and glial cells, which is a complex and poorly understood challenge. Researchers have discovered that in planarians, neurons and glial cells are regenerated from distinct progenitor cells. The study found that planarians first regenerate neurons that express a specific gene called delta-2 at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. These delta-2-expressing neurons then instruct phagocytic progenitor cells, which express a different gene called Notch-1, to differentiate into glial cells. The researchers found that inhibiting delta-2 or Notch-1 severely reduced the number of glial cells in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. The study suggests that the patterned expression of delta-2 in neurons plays a crucial role in instructing phagocytic progenitors to differentiate into glial cells, providing a mechanism for the coordinated regeneration of neurons and glial cells. This discovery presents a new understanding of how planarians regenerate their nervous system and could have implications for the development of new treatments for nervous system injuries in humans. The researchers propose a model in which the interaction between delta-2-expressing neurons and Notch-1-expressing phagocytic progenitors is essential for the coordinated regeneration of neurons and glial cells. This mechanism could also facilitate the evolution of new configurations of glial cells in the nervous system.
Researchers studied the role of a type of immune cell called gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of antibodies that can neutralize the HIV virus. Neutralizing antibodies are crucial for preventing the virus from infecting cells. The study focused on participants who had previously been identified as either "broad" or "non-broad" neutralizers, meaning some were able to produce antibodies that could neutralize a wide range of HIV strains, while others were not.

The researchers found that γδ T cells played a significant role in the development of neutralizing antibodies. Specifically, they discovered that certain markers on the surface of γδ T cells, such as CD16 and CD57, were present in higher levels in participants who developed broad neutralizing antibodies. These markers were also associated with the early production of a specific type of antibody called IgM, which is an indicator of the immune system's initial response to the virus.

The study also found that γδ T cells were activated early in the course of HIV infection, and that their activation was linked to the level of viral load in the body. This suggests that γδ T cells may play a role in controlling the initial replication of the virus.

The findings of this study have implications for the development of HIV vaccines. By understanding how γδ T cells contribute to the development of neutralizing antibodies, researchers may be able to design more effective vaccine strategies that target these cells and promote the production of broad and potent neutralizing antibodies.
Researchers have developed a novel bispecific antibody, BS1, that targets two key cell surface receptors, IL-6R and IL-8R, which are involved in a synergistic pathway that drives tumor metastasis. These receptors, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8, are secreted by tumor cells and enhance cancer spread. The BS1 antibody combines two distinct antibodies, tocilizumab and 10H2, which target IL-6R and IL-8R, respectively. Studies have shown that blocking these receptors with BS1 significantly reduces metastatic burden in preclinical mouse models of cancer.

To better understand how BS1 works, researchers developed a computational model that simulates the binding of the antibody to the receptors. The model reveals that the balance between binary (antibody-receptor) and ternary (receptor-antibody-receptor) complexes drives receptor inhibition. The study found that when IL-6R and IL-8R are present in a 1:1 ratio, bispecific antibody binding is similar to the binding of the combination of anti-IL-6R and anti-IL-8R monospecific antibodies. This suggests that the relative amount of the two target receptors is critical for bispecific antibody binding.

The researchers used simulations to study the impact of antibody concentration on bispecific antibody-receptor complex formation. They found that the total level of receptor expression and the relative amount of the two target receptors are key determinants of bispecific antibody binding. The study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying bispecific antibody binding and inhibition, which can guide therapeutic design and maximize the efficacy of new treatments.
Researchers studied the role of ZYG-8, a protein involved in cell division, in the development of oocytes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Unlike most cells, oocytes lack centrosomes, which are structures that help organize the spindle, a critical component of cell division. The study found that ZYG-8 is essential for the proper formation and stability of the spindle in oocytes. Without ZYG-8, the spindle becomes overelongated and defective. The researchers also discovered that ZYG-8 helps regulate the forces that build and stabilize the spindle by controlling the activity of motor proteins that move along microtubules. Additionally, ZYG-8 is required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle. The study suggests that ZYG-8 plays a dual role in regulating microtubule dynamics and motor-driven forces within the spindle. The findings provide new insights into how acentrosomal spindles, like those found in oocytes, are stabilized to ensure faithful cell division. The research also sheds light on the mechanisms by which ZYG-8, a protein conserved across species, contributes to cell division. The study's results have implications for understanding the regulation of microtubule dynamics and spindle forces, which are critical for proper cell division. Further research is needed to fully understand the complex roles of ZYG-8 in cell division.
Researchers investigated the relationship between type 2 diabetes (T2D), genetics, and metabolite levels in a large dataset from the UK Biobank. They found that 79 metabolites, mostly related to lipids and lipoproteins, have a causal association with T2D. In contrast, twice as many metabolites are affected by T2D liability, including branched-chain amino acids. This suggests that T2D has a broader impact on metabolite levels than previously thought.

The study also identified four metabolites whose genetic regulation is altered in people with T2D compared to those without the disease. These metabolites were consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank. The genetic variants associated with these metabolites are significant in the general population but not linked to T2D risk, indicating that T2D affects the genetic regulation of metabolite levels.

Furthermore, the researchers found that 165 metabolites are associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications. However, only a few of these metabolites are causally linked to T2D, suggesting that there are biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications. Overall, the study provides a map of the consequences of T2D on metabolite levels and their genetic regulation, shedding light on the T2D trajectory leading to complications.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections, which can range from mild skin infections to life-threatening conditions. They focused on two strains of mice: CC061, which is highly susceptible to S. aureus, and CC024, which is tolerant of the infection. By crossing these two strains, the researchers created F1 and F2 generations of mice to identify the genetic factors involved in tolerance.

The study found that the F1 generation had a 65% survival rate after S. aureus infection, while the F2 generation had a 55% survival rate. The researchers identified a genetic region on chromosome 7, known as a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL), that contributed to the tolerant phenotype in CC024 mice. Within this region, two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, were found to have high-impact variants. These genes are receptors for the complement factor C5a, which can trigger a massive immune response.

The researchers hypothesize that the variant receptors in CC024 mice may alter the binding of C5a, reducing the damage caused by the cytokine storm and allowing the mice to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and survive longer. The study suggests that the genetic factors involved in tolerance to S. aureus infection are complex and involve multiple genes, including C5ar1 and C5ar2.
Researchers studied how genetic networks influence adaptation in populations. They used a simple gene regulatory network to model a quantitative trait and simulated adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum. The study found that both additive and network models had fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. However, the network model had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a significant density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. The study suggests that genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects.

The researchers used a combination of biological realism and existing tools to evaluate the shape of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks. They found stark differences from classical expectations in some cases. Both network and additive models exhibited similarities in key aspects of their adaptive walks, such as the number of adaptive steps and the distribution of fitness effects among fixations and beneficial mutations. However, the network model approached the optimum more slowly than additive models on average.

The study highlights the importance of considering gene interaction networks in models of adaptation, which have traditionally relied on direct genotype-phenotype relationships. The results suggest that non-additive genotype-phenotype maps can affect a population's ability to adapt to a changing environment.
Researchers have proposed a new way to understand how the brain integrates information from different sources to make decisions. They suggest that neurons and synapses are naturally equipped to perform this integration according to Bayesian probability theory. In this theory, the brain weighs the reliability of different sources of information to make a decision. The researchers propose that the apical dendrites of neurons represent prior expectations, while the basal dendrites represent the likelihood of a particular outcome. These are represented by local quantities, such as the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. They show that under these assumptions, the somatic compartment of the neuron naturally computes the corresponding posterior, which is the probability of a particular outcome given the available information. The researchers also derive a rule for synaptic plasticity, which allows neurons to adjust the strength of their connections based on the reliability of the information they provide. This theory explains various experimental findings related to multi-sensory integration and makes predictions that can be tested experimentally. The researchers demonstrate that their theory can be used to simulate the learning of a prototypical multi-sensory integration task. They also show that their theory is consistent with the idea that synaptic plasticity tries to match bottom-up input to top-down expectations. Overall, the researchers provide a new framework for understanding how the brain integrates information and makes decisions.
Researchers have made significant progress in predicting protein structures using the AlphaFold Database, which contains 48 whole proteomes from various organisms, including zebrafish, fruit flies, and E. coli. By applying the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains (ECOD) to these predictions, the team was able to classify 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins, covering over 226,424,000 amino acid residues. On average, they were able to provide positive classification for 90% of residues in all proteomes.

The study found that eukaryotes have a higher proportion of disordered regions and unassigned domains compared to bacteria. Additionally, eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. The researchers also identified highly populated domains shared between eukaryotes and bacteria, such as Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains.

The team compared the sampling of homologous groups from the whole proteome set against their stable ECOD reference and found that structure predictions have expanded our knowledge of previously unknown domains. They also observed that among larger, well-understood protein families, there is a convergence between sequence and structural classifications facilitated by accurate structure predictions. However, among less populated homologous groups, structural domain classification is still finding domains previously unannotated by sequence domain classifications.

The study suggests that the division of predicted models into easily classified domains, domains with more distant or difficult-to-recognize homology, or regions that are unstructured or have no domains whatsoever will continue to be a useful strategy for grappling with large structural datasets.
BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, but there are currently no antiviral treatments available. Researchers have long believed that BKPyV's large T antigen (TAg) promotes cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle, allowing the virus to replicate. However, a new study has challenged this model by using single-cell analysis to examine TAg expression throughout the cell cycle. The study found that robust TAg expression actually requires the host cell's DNA to replicate first, not the other way around. This means that BKPyV relies on the host cell's S phase to replicate its own DNA. The researchers also discovered that BKPyV promotes cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters the S phase without going through mitosis or the G1 phase, resulting in cells with more than 4N DNA content. This process relies on the host cell's canonical cell cycle machinery and regulators. The study's findings suggest a new model for polyomavirus replication, where robust TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication. Understanding the molecular events required for BKPyV production could lead to the identification of effective therapeutic targets against the virus. The study's results also align with the replication mechanisms of other small DNA tumor viruses, such as papilloma- and adenoviruses.
Researchers have developed a new tool called FABIO, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) fine-mapping method designed to identify genes associated with binary traits, such as diseases. Unlike existing methods, FABIO models all genes on a chromosome together to capture correlations between genes, which can increase the power of TWAS fine-mapping. The method uses a probit model to link genetically regulated expression (GReX) of genes to binary outcomes, taking into account the correlation among all genes on a chromosome. This approach effectively controls false discoveries and offers substantial power gains over existing methods. In simulations, FABIO significantly reduced the size of causal gene sets by 27.9-36.9% compared to existing approaches. The researchers applied FABIO to six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank and successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits, offering improved power and reduced false discoveries. The method is scalable to large biobank-scale datasets, making it a valuable resource for researchers studying complex diseases.
Researchers have discovered that two proteins, Btn2 and Hsp42, play a crucial role in protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress occurs when cells are exposed to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can cause proteins to misfold and aggregate. This can lead to cell dysfunction and toxicity. Btn2 and Hsp42 act as "sequestrases," helping to sequester misfolded proteins into specific sites within cells, preventing them from causing harm. When these proteins are absent, cells become more susceptible to oxidative stress and accumulate protein aggregates, leading to cell damage. The study found that cells lacking Btn2 and Hsp42 are more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, a common cause of oxidative stress. The researchers also identified the Sup35 protein as a substrate for Btn2 and Hsp42, and found that the absence of these sequestrases leads to the formation of a toxic protein aggregate called the [PSI+] prion. The study suggests that protein sequestration is a key defense mechanism against oxidative stress, and that Btn2 and Hsp42 play a critical role in maintaining cellular health by preventing protein misfolding and aggregation. The findings have implications for our understanding of protein-related diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, which are characterized by protein misfolding and aggregation.
A recent study used CRISPR-interference (CRISPRi) to identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that contribute to glioblastoma (GBM) invasion. While previous research has focused on coding genes, this study aimed to explore the role of lncRNAs in GBM invasion. The researchers developed a CRISPRi-based invasion screen to evaluate the function of 2,307 candidate lncRNAs in GBM cells. The screen identified 48 lncRNAs that were significantly associated with a decrease in invasion capacity when knocked down. The top candidate, LINC03045, was found to decrease tumor cell invasion by 82.7% and was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade. Further analysis revealed that LINC03045 expression was correlated with the expression of WASF3, a gene previously implicated in tumor invasion studies. Knockdown of WASF3 was associated with a significant decrease in invasion, and overexpression of WASF3 rescued the invasive function lost with LINC03045 knockdown. The study suggests that LINC03045 may regulate invasion via WASF3, and its expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. The findings of this study provide new insights into the role of lncRNAs in GBM invasion and identify LINC03045 as a potential therapeutic target.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes sequences of auditory stimuli. They used electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants who listened to a sequence of sounds generated by a random process. The goal was to identify the type of model the brain uses to understand these sequences. A new clustering procedure was developed to analyze the EEG data and group similar patterns together. This approach allowed the researchers to identify the regularities in the sequence of sounds that the brain uses to build a model. The results showed that the brain uses the repetition of strong beats in the sequence of sounds to build a model of the sequence. This suggests that the brain uses a specific type of model, based on the occurrence of strong beats, to understand the sequence of auditory stimuli. The study provides evidence that the brain uses a probabilistic model to process sequences of stimuli, and that this model is based on the repetition of strong beats in the sequence. The findings have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes auditory information and how it builds models of the world around us.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at the single-cell level. However, it has limitations when applied to highly heterogeneous solid tissues and organs, which require cell dissociation for analysis. This can lead to discrepancies between bulk RNA-seq results and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq results using composite scRNA-seq data. To address this issue, researchers have developed a computationally calculated coefficient called the "cell type-specific weighting factor" (cWF). The cWF is designed to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression.

The researchers computed cWFs for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs and validated their accuracy using five different methods. These methods included reconstitution, deconvolution of whole-organ RNA-seq data, comparison to experimentally measured transcript contents, independence from differential cell-type ratios, and prediction using unmatched organ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data. The results showed that cWFs effectively account for transcriptome size variations and differential cryptic gene expression, leading to more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data. Additionally, cWFs were found to predict aging progression, suggesting their potential diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanisms. Overall, this study provides an important method for solving critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues and organs, and highlights the diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs.
Researchers have developed a new statistical approach called Radial Multivariable Mendelian Randomization (MVMR) to estimate the direct effects of multiple exposures on an outcome. This method extends the traditional Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach, which uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of a single exposure on an outcome. However, MR and MVMR can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants, which affect multiple traits simultaneously. To address this issue, the researchers propose a radial formulation of MVMR, which allows for the visualization of the effects of each exposure within an MVMR analysis. This approach also includes an option to remove outlying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may violate the assumptions of MVMR.

The Radial MVMR approach is implemented in an R package called RMVMR, which provides a range of tools for exploring the results of MVMR analyses. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of Radial MVMR through simulations and applied analyses, including an analysis of the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease. They show that Radial MVMR can effectively visualize causal effect estimates and provide valuable diagnostic information about the underlying assumptions of MVMR. The approach also allows for the identification and removal of outlying SNPs, which can reduce bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy.
Researchers studied the behavior of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) over a period of up to 7 days to understand how their behavior changes across different timescales. They used a high-speed camera to record the flies' movements at 100 frames per second and analyzed the data using a deep learning framework called SLEAP. This allowed them to track the flies' postures and identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion.

The researchers found that the flies exhibit distinct daily patterns in their behavior, including changes in grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion speed. They also discovered that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, and that this time point is associated with other indicators of health, such as locomotion speed and the amount of time spent moving versus resting.

As the flies aged, the researchers observed a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed, and an increase in the amount of time spent in an idle state. They also found that the difference in behavior between day and night hours decreased as the flies weakened and died, similar to the weakening of circadian rhythms with age. The study provides new insights into the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster and highlights the importance of considering multiple timescales when studying animal behavior.
Researchers have identified a new function for a protein called PTPN-22 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. PTPN-22 is a tyrosine phosphatase, a type of enzyme that removes phosphate groups from other proteins. While PTPN-22 has been studied in the context of the immune system, its roles beyond immunoregulation were not well understood. The study found that PTPN-22 plays a crucial role in the worm's molting process, which is essential for growth and adaptation to new environments. Molting is a complex process that involves cell adhesion, cytoskeletal regulation, and membrane trafficking. The researchers discovered that PTPN-22 interacts with other proteins called NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, which are involved in membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by mutations in NEKL-2 and NEKL-3. The study also found that PTPN-22 interacts with a protein called DNBP-1, which is involved in cell adhesion and cytoskeletal regulation. Furthermore, PTPN-22 was found to play a role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues, including epidermal adhesion complexes and nucleocytoplasmic transport. The study used a combination of genetic and proteomic approaches to identify novel functions of PTPN-22, highlighting the utility of this approach for discovering new gene functions.
Researchers have developed a new tool to track the spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, a major challenge to malaria elimination efforts. Artemisinin derivatives are the current gold standard treatment for malaria, but resistance to these drugs has been growing in the region. The WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) has collected data on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 (K13) gene, which is associated with artemisinin resistance. Using this data and a Bayesian geostatistical model, the researchers created spatio-temporal maps of K13 mutation prevalence across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022. The maps show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the region, with the most significant spatial change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The study provides the first fine-scale predictive maps of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, allowing health organizations to prioritize malaria control measures and target preventive strategies more effectively. The maps can also be used to guide surveillance for resistance and inform policies to prevent the further spread of resistance. The study's findings are consistent with previous research on the spread of artemisinin resistance and provide critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the inflammasome signaling pathway, a crucial part of the innate immune response. Specifically, they have focused on function-to-find domain (FIIND)-containing proteins, such as NLRP1 and CARD8, which play a vital role in this pathway. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length (FL), cleaved N-terminal (NT), and cleaved C-terminal (CT) peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes.

Studies have shown that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. The researchers found that the Linker3 region in murine NLRP1b (mNLRP1b) and the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 (rNLRP1) and CARD8 mediate these interactions. Additionally, they explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 (DPP9) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure.

The study demonstrated that DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complexes. However, DPP9 cannot bind to NTs of human NLRP1 (hNLRP1). Functional assays showed that DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8 but does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT. This research has enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation, highlighting the complexity of their interactions within the immune response.
Researchers have identified a protein called Rer1 that plays a crucial role in maintaining protein homeostasis in cells. Protein homeostasis is the balance between protein production and degradation, and defects in this process can lead to cellular stress and tissue damage. In a study on fruit flies, scientists found that Rer1 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments, where it helps regulate protein production. When Rer1 is missing, cells experience stress and are eliminated through a process called cell competition, where healthier cells outcompete and eliminate weaker cells.

The researchers also found that Rer1 levels increase in cells that are overproducing a protein called Myc, which can cause cells to grow too quickly. This increase in Rer1 helps alleviate the stress caused by Myc overproduction, allowing the cells to survive. The study suggests that Rer1 acts as a regulator of proteostasis, or protein homeostasis, and plays a role in competitive cell survival. The findings have implications for understanding how cells regulate protein production and how defects in this process can lead to tissue damage and disease. The study provides new insights into the function of Rer1 and its role in maintaining cellular health.
Researchers have found that mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. However, most of the possible changes in the CHEK2 gene have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2 protein. To address this, scientists used a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS) to test all but two of the 4,887 possible changes in the CHEK2 gene for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. The results showed that 770 of the non-synonymous changes were damaging to protein function, while 2,417 were tolerated. This information can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance found in clinical databases. The study also found that the results from the DMS screen correlated well with previous structure and function data and provided a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. This approach can be used to predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes. The study used a comprehensive library of CHEK2 coding variants and next-generation sequencing to identify complementors in the selected yeast, allowing for the testing of 4,885 of the 4,887 possible CHEK2 SNVs, including all but one of the 3,913 possible codon changes.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae adapts to its environment. The bacteria can switch between two distinct forms, known as opaque and transparent colonies, which are associated with different epigenetic and phenotypic traits. The researchers found that this switch is controlled by the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin system, which regulates the orientation of DNA inversions in the colony opacity-determinant (cod) locus. The SpxA1-TenA system is a type II toxin-antitoxin system, where the toxin TenA is repressed by its antitoxin SpxA1. When TenA is overexpressed, it binds to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, reducing the expression of the alternative sigma factor ComX, which in turn enhances the transcription of the invertase gene psrA. This leads to the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. The researchers found that spontaneous variations in the number of AT dinucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon act as a programmed genetic switch, generating pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity. The SpxA1-TenA system is a previously uncharacterized type II toxin-antitoxin system in S. pneumoniae, and its discovery provides new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial adaptation and pathogenesis.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) to compare two high-dimensional datasets collected under different experimental conditions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), can only analyze one dataset at a time. Contrastive PCA (cPCA) was previously proposed to address this issue, but it requires a hyperparameter (α) that needs to be tuned, resulting in multiple possible solutions with no clear correct answer. Additionally, cPCA treats the two conditions asymmetrically, making it unsuitable for comparing two experimental conditions symmetrically.

The new gcPCA method eliminates the need for the hyperparameter α by introducing a normalization factor that mitigates the bias towards high-variance dimensions. This allows gcPCA to find dimensions that exhibit the largest relative changes in variance between conditions. The method can be used to analyze diverse high-dimensional biological data, such as neurophysiological recordings and single-cell RNA sequencing data.

gcPCA has been implemented in an open-source toolbox, available in Python and MATLAB, with several variants tailored for different scenarios. The method has been demonstrated to be useful in detecting unsupervised patterns in data, such as the detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and the heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. Overall, gcPCA provides a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method for analyzing high-dimensional datasets, facilitating the discovery of new insights into complex biological phenomena.
Researchers have developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells. BCR signaling is crucial for B cell survival and maturation, but its downstream pathways are not well understood. The model, based on phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells, revealed feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. This crosstalk was verified in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. The model was also tested in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cell lines with aberrant BCR signaling, showing that BCR aberration does not cause major downstream rewiring. The researchers found that the BL-2-derived network structure forms a solid base to describe signaling networks in DLBCL cell lines. Despite discovering feedbacks and crosstalks in ERK and p38 signaling, no cellular dependency was found in the studied cell lines. However, these signaling motifs are conserved across different B cell lymphoma types, suggesting that the study's insights may apply to other B cell lymphomas. The model was improved by discovering three novel connections: a positive crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, a positive feedback from GSK3 to ZAP70, and a negative crosstalk from p38 on or above RAF/MEK/ERK.
Researchers have long understood that the Notch receptor signaling network plays a crucial role in tissue growth and maintenance. This process is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation and intracellular cis inhibition. Notch receptors interact with ligands expressed in neighboring cells to trigger transactivation, while cis inhibition occurs when ligands bind to receptors within the same cell. Different combinations of Notch receptors and ligands can produce distinct molecular and cellular responses, influencing the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signaling.

A recent study has shed new light on the molecular basis of Notch signaling, focusing on the opposing actions of DLL4 and JAG1 ligands in controlling angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modeling, the researchers found that DLL4 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation, while JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition by forming a JAG1/DLL4 complex. This heteromeric complex enables angiogenic sprouting by regulating the functional differentiation of endothelial cells into leading edge tip cells and trailing stalk cells.

The study proposes a new model of Notch signaling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The findings suggest that a heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complex relieves Notch1 receptor cis-inhibition, allowing for efficient Notch1 receptor signaling. This new understanding of Notch signaling has significant implications for our understanding of angiogenic patterning and the regulation of endothelial cell differentiation.
Researchers have developed a new clustering method called Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPMUnc) that takes into account the uncertainty associated with data points. Clustering is a widely used technique in bioinformatics and other fields, but existing methods often ignore uncertainty or measurement error. DPMUnc is an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that uses uncertainty to inform the clustering process. The researchers tested DPMUnc on simulated data and found that it outperformed existing methods. They also applied DPMUnc to cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked to the sample size of the study. DPMUnc successfully separated autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and identified other subgroups, such as adult-onset arthritis.

The researchers also explored the use of DPMUnc to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarized using gene signatures. They developed a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different from the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. They applied this procedure to three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. The results showed an association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets. The researchers suggest that DPMUnc can be used to cluster individuals using sets of polygenic risk scores, where the uncertainty in the PRS coefficients could be exploited rather than ignored.
Deep neural networks have been successful in modeling the primate visual system, but they struggle to account for the importance of shape in human vision. Unlike humans, who rely heavily on shape to determine category membership, deep networks rely more on color and texture features. Researchers designed artificial image datasets to investigate why this is the case. They trained networks from scratch to classify images using single features and combinations of features, and found that some network architectures are unable to learn shape features, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. The bias can be explained by the interactions between weight updates during mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are needed to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their ability to describe human vision. Convolutional neural networks, in particular, developed a bias towards color and texture features, even though they were able to learn shape-based classification. The bias arises from the dynamics of gradient descent learning, specifically from the alignment of gradients for color and texture features with image classes. Reducing this alignment enables networks to learn shape-based classification. The study's findings suggest that changes to the learning algorithm, rather than network architecture, are necessary to enable deep networks to recognize shapes.
Researchers have developed a new model to study the behavior of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), which play a key role in liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic liver diseases. The model, based on the Kappa graph rewriting language, simulates the dynamics of HSCs during fibrosis progression and reversion, taking into account the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes. The model reveals the critical role of HSC inactivation in eliminating activated HSCs during reversion, but also shows that reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs (iHSCs) are necessary to sustain fibrosis. The model is sensitive to the levels of TGFβ1, a molecule that regulates HSC activation and collagen secretion. Using experimental data from a mouse model of liver fibrosis, the researchers validated the predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease, which was confirmed by analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with liver fibrosis. The study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease and identifies iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression. The model can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues. The study demonstrates the applicability of the Kappa language to multi-scale approaches and provides insights into the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis.
Researchers have developed a new meta-analysis framework to estimate the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex human traits and diseases. This framework is particularly useful for large-scale genomic consortia, like the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program, which comprises multiple cohorts with diverse technologies. The new method, called MEGA, requires only summary statistics and can account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to varying genomic profiling platforms. In simulations, MEGA was found to be more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory results comparable to analyzing individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity. The researchers applied MEGA to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The results showed that gene expression had a significant mediation effect on both traits. The MEGA method is available in an R package called MetaR2M on GitHub. This new framework can be used to identify potential mediators influencing health-related outcomes and can be applied to various high-dimensional omics data, such as gene expression, methylation, and copy number variation. The method can also be used to evaluate potential heterogeneity across risk factors for common diseases and genomic profiling technologies.
Researchers have developed a new method called PDRWH to identify the genetic mutations that drive cancer development in individual patients. Unlike existing methods, PDRWH takes into account the unique characteristics of each patient's cancer, rather than relying on a single list of driver genes that applies to all patients. The method works by analyzing the impact of mutated genes on the expression of other genes in a group of patients with similar genetic mutations and gene expression profiles. This approach allows PDRWH to identify both common and rare driver genes that contribute to cancer progression.

The researchers tested PDRWH on 16 cancer datasets from the TCGA and found that it outperformed existing methods in identifying known driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. PDRWH also demonstrated its ability to identify personalized driver profiles that could improve tumor stratification and provide new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity. One of the predicted novel driver genes, Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), was validated in vitro, showing that its high expression promotes tumor cell proliferation.

The PDRWH method has the potential to aid in the development of personalized cancer treatments by identifying the specific genetic mutations that contribute to an individual's cancer. This could lead to more effective and targeted therapies. The researchers expect that PDRWH will assist in the development of optimal personalized treatment plans in the future.
Researchers have developed a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy called the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP). The VEP combines personalized anatomical data with mathematical models of abnormal brain activity to generate seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods. This allows for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. To improve the accuracy of the VEP model, the researchers used a global optimization approach called SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm that can perform parallel computation. This approach successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and performance compared to other parallel solvers. The researchers also used a Bayesian optimization framework to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters, resulting in significant gains in accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, they added a phase to quantify the uncertainty in the estimated parameters across different problems. This study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, which can inform clinical decision-making. The VEP model can accurately capture diverse seizure dynamics and generate computer simulations resembling intracranial EEG recordings, making it a valuable tool for optimizing surgical strategies and aiding in clinical decision-making.
Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health problem, with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. The disease is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which grows in the lungs. However, the rate at which Mtb replicates and dies in the lungs of infected individuals or animals is not well understood. Researchers infected rabbits with a new strain of Mtb, HN878, which carries a plasmid called pBP10. They found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 than in a commonly used laboratory strain, H37Rv. In the lungs of infected rabbits, the percentage of bacteria carrying pBP10 increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection, despite a large increase in bacterial numbers. Mathematical modeling suggested that this non-monotonic change is due to the presence of multiple sub-populations of Mtb with different replication and death rates. One sub-population expands early and is controlled, while another sub-population expands later, causing the increase in pBP10-carrying bacteria. The study also found that the dynamics of Mtb in rabbits are different from those in mice, highlighting the importance of using multiple animal models to study TB. The results suggest that there may be independent bacterial dynamics within individual granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in response to Mtb infection. Further research is needed to understand how immunity controls Mtb dynamics and to compare the replication rates of different Mtb strains in various animal models.
Researchers have developed a new computational tool called GlycanTreeModeler to predict the structure of complex sugar molecules called glycans. Glycans play a crucial role in many biological processes, but determining their structure is notoriously difficult. The new tool uses data from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. It was tested on a variety of glycan structures and showed high accuracy in predicting their native structures. The tool was also used to design new glycan structures to shield regions of a protein nanoparticle vaccine from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This work has the potential to aid in the prediction of glycoprotein models, glycan masking, and experimental structure determination. The GlycanTreeModeler and associated tools allow researchers to accurately model glycans through de novo and density-guided modeling. The algorithm and energy function were rigorously optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity, achieving a median de novo root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 2.7 angstroms. The results show that the GlycanTreeModeler can accurately predict glycan structures, build them into known density, and be used in protein surface modification.
Researchers have identified a protein complex in the fungus Penicillium oxalicum that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression. The complex, called SCFFbx23-Ace1, consists of two main components: PoFbx23, a ubiquitin ligase, and PoAce1, a transcription factor. PoFbx23 recognizes and activates PoAce1, allowing it to regulate the expression of various genes involved in fungal growth, development, and enzyme production.

In the absence of PoFbx23, PoAce1 accumulates in the cell and becomes dysfunctional, unable to bind to its target genes. This leads to the upregulation of genes involved in breaking down cellulose, a key component of plant cell walls, and the downregulation of genes involved in asexual development and spore pigmentation.

The researchers found that PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating PoAce1 to regulate gene expression in response to different signals. The study suggests that PoFbx23 plays a vital role in maintaining PoAce1's activity and that the SCFFbx23-Ace1 complex is essential for regulating gene expression in Penicillium oxalicum.

The discovery of the SCFFbx23-Ace1 complex provides new insights into the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in fungi and has implications for the development of new biotechnological applications, such as the production of cellulolytic enzymes. The study also highlights the importance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in fungal growth, development, and enzyme synthesis.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding how the basement membrane (BM) forms and diversifies in tissues. The BM is a crucial structural element that plays a key role in organ development. However, the mechanisms behind its formation and diversification were not well understood. A study on Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium found that the BM is composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix. The researchers identified two parallel routes for BM protein secretion, mediated by Rab10 and Rab8. When both routes were blocked, BM production was completely halted. However, genetic interactions revealed that these two routes competed with each other. Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion, while Rab8 promoted basal secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. The study also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) and Rab10 were present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. The exocyst complex was found to have a dual function in this context, interacting with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization and being required for the Rab8 route. These findings highlight the importance of spatial control of distinct traffic routes in BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge during development. The study proposes that the co-existence of parallel secretory routes with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes is the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). The model, called the Language-Based Universal Model (LBUM), uses a technique called multi-task learning (MTL) to improve predictions. MTL involves training the model on multiple antibodies at once, rather than one at a time. This approach has been shown to increase the model's performance and address two major challenges in HIV-1 research: underrepresentation of certain HIV-1 subtypes in training datasets and the need to determine optimal combinations of bnAbs to avoid resistance.

The LBUM model was pre-trained on HIV-1 Env sequences without neutralization data and fine-tuned with sequences that included both non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data. The researchers compared the LBUM model to classical machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and gradient boosting machines, and found that it outperformed them. The LBUM model was able to mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict antibodies' epitopes and select optimal bnAb combinations. The researchers believe that the potential of MTL revealed in this study addresses key challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research and can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Researchers have developed new predictive models for multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, that take into account the pathways involved in the disease rather than just individual genes. These pathway-based models have been shown to be more accurate and stable than traditional gene-based models in predicting patient outcomes. The new models were tested using data from patients with multiple myeloma and compared to previously published models. The results showed that the pathway-based models, particularly those incorporating immune-related pathways, were more effective in predicting patient outcomes. This is consistent with the fact that multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which are a critical component of the immune system.

The researchers used two strategies to develop the pathway-based models: pathway score methods and group lasso. The pathway score methods converted gene expression data into pathway scores, which were then used to build predictive models. The group lasso method, on the other hand, selected a subset of pathways that were most relevant to the disease. The new models were also more resistant to missing data and were able to accurately predict patient outcomes even with a small amount of missing data.

The results of the study suggest that pathway-based models are a promising alternative to traditional gene-based models for predicting patient outcomes in multiple myeloma. The new models have been documented in an R package, which includes a missing data imputation method to facilitate future validation. The study's findings have implications for the development of more accurate and personalized treatment plans for patients with multiple myeloma.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to study the process of mitochondrial fission, which is the division of a mitochondrion into two daughter organelles. Mitochondrial fission is a critical process that occurs in response to cellular injury and is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. The model focuses on the role of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), a protein that plays a key role in mitochondrial fission. The researchers used a nonlinear dynamical systems approach to identify parameters that regulate the rate of mitochondrial fission. They found that the total fission rate (TFR) and the cumulative total fission (TF) depend strongly on a single parameter, μ, which represents the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers. The researchers discovered that the cumulative TF does not increase monotonically with μ, but instead increases to a certain point and then decreases as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests that interventions targeting certain regulatory parameters, such as the association and dissociation rate constants between Drp1 and mitochondrial fission factor (Mff), may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Understanding the impact of these regulatory parameters may aid in the selection of future therapeutic targets for diseases related to mitochondrial dysfunction.
Researchers have developed a new gene drive system to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests using the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool. The system targets the Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc2) gene in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest, and Drosophila melanogaster, a model insect. By using three guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target the Tdc2 gene, the researchers aimed to reduce the development of resistance alleles. The system was designed to induce nonfunctional mutations at the desired sites, minimizing the formation rate of functional resistance alleles.

The researchers found that feeding octopamine to female flies restored their egg-laying defects, making it easier to maintain the population. They also tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. The study revealed that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles and that the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity.

This research highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects. The study demonstrates the robust use of the CRISPR/Cas9 genetic tool to construct gene drive systems targeting haplosufficient female fertility genes in both agricultural pests and model insects. The findings have significant implications for the development of gene drive systems for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests.
Researchers have found that the brain's ability to learn and form memories is not only limited by the energy needed for computation, but also by the energy required for synaptic plasticity, the process of changing the strength of connections between neurons. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks can be metabolically costly, and more complex tasks can require a significant amount of energy. To better understand how the brain learns efficiently, the researchers explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks. They proposed two algorithms that restrict plasticity to save energy: one that only modifies synapses with large updates, and another that restricts plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. These algorithms were found to save energy while only slightly increasing learning time. The results suggest that competitively restricting plasticity can help reduce the metabolic energy associated with synaptic plasticity. The study's findings may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a more efficient match between artificial and biological learning. Additionally, the algorithms could benefit hardware design, as electronic memory storage is also energetically costly.
Scientists have engineered bacteria with reduced genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis, but this process often results in reduced fitness. To understand how to overcome these defects, researchers studied six variants of the Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx, each with a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region, and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. They evolved replicate populations of these strains in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium for approximately 300 generations and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates. The results showed that fitness increased in all cases, except for two ancestors that failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated across all strains, but the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. The study demonstrates that fitness lost during genome streamlining can be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution, often through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments.
Researchers have developed a new tool to control gene expression in zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism. The tool, called RiboFlip, uses a self-cleaving ribozyme to reduce the levels of a specific gene's mRNA. The ribozyme, called T3H48, is inserted into the gene's intron, a non-coding region of the DNA. When activated, the ribozyme cuts the pre-mRNA, leading to a 20-fold reduction in gene expression. The researchers tested RiboFlip in the albino gene, which is responsible for pigmentation in zebrafish. They found that activating RiboFlip resulted in a pigmentation phenotype similar to that of a mutant zebrafish. The effect was reversible, and the pigmentation returned to normal when the ribozyme was inactivated using a base-editing strategy. The researchers also created a version of RiboFlip that can be activated by the Cre or Flippase enzymes, allowing for more precise control over gene expression. This tool can be used to study the function of specific genes in zebrafish and has the potential to be used in other vertebrate models. The RiboFlip cassette can also be used to label cells that have been knocked down, independently of the expression of the target gene. This new tool expands the genetic toolbox available for studying gene function in vertebrates and offers an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies.
Researchers have developed a new software tool called aiSEGcell to help scientists analyze microscopic images of cells without the need for fluorescent labeling. Traditional methods require cells to be labeled with fluorescent dyes, which can be time-consuming and may damage the cells. aiSEGcell uses a type of artificial intelligence called convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and segment cells in bright field images, which are commonly used in microscopy. This approach eliminates the need for fluorescent labeling, freeing up imaging channels and reducing phototoxicity. The software is user-friendly and can be used by anyone, regardless of their coding experience. It is also adaptable to new use cases and can be retrained with just 32 images. aiSEGcell has been extensively tested on various cell types and imaging modalities, including challenging conditions such as low magnification and time-lapse imaging. The software has been shown to accurately segment nuclei and retain biologically relevant information, making it suitable for demanding applications such as quantifying signaling pathway activity dynamics. Additionally, aiSEGcell is available in both command line and graphical user interface formats, making it accessible to a wide range of users. The researchers have also released a large dataset of 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images, which can be used to further train and improve the software.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to identify features that predict rewards in new environments. They asked 295 participants to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits, where one feature predicted the reward and the other did not. The researchers manipulated the speed of change of the features and found that participants learned faster when the reward-predicting feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature changed quickly, compared to when the opposite was the case. This suggests that humans have a bias towards learning from features that change slowly.

The study used a decision-making task where participants had to repeatedly learn which feature predicted the reward. The results showed that participants learned the value of stimuli faster when the reward-predicting feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature changed quickly. After learning, participants could generalize the learned values to new stimuli equally well in both conditions.

The researchers used a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models to test how feature speed affects learning. The results showed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The more participants improved in performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates.

Overall, the study provides evidence that human reinforcement learning favors slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. The findings have implications for understanding how humans learn and make decisions in complex environments.
Researchers have identified a new gene called Resf1 as a potential tumor suppressor in a type of breast cancer called ER-negative breast cancer. This type of cancer has a poor prognosis and often leads to rapid recurrence or spread to other parts of the body. The study used a mouse model to investigate the role of Resf1 in breast cancer and found that reducing the gene's expression led to increased tumor growth, faster tumor progression, and more lung metastases. This suggests that Resf1 plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of cancer cells.

The researchers used a combination of genetic analysis and mouse models to study Resf1. They found that mice with reduced Resf1 expression had a higher incidence of metastatic disease and more pulmonary metastases. The study also analyzed human breast cancer data and found that lower expression of Resf1 was associated with worse outcomes.

Resf1 is a poorly characterized gene that produces a large, unstructured protein. The researchers used CRISPR-mediated deletion to reduce Resf1 expression in mice and found that it led to increased tumor burden, rapid tumor growth, and more pulmonary metastases. This suggests that Resf1 acts as a tumor suppressor in ER-negative breast cancer. The study also found that Resf1 is involved in transcriptional control, particularly in the regulation of ribosomal biogenesis.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the biology of ER-negative breast cancer and identifies Resf1 as a potential target for therapy. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of Resf1 in cancer and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.
Researchers studied the roles of two proteins, Mec1 and Rad24, in meiotic recombination, a process that occurs during cell division in yeast. Meiotic recombination involves the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes, which is essential for genetic diversity and proper chromosome segregation. Mec1 and Rad24 are part of the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, which is activated when DNA breaks occur during meiosis. The study found that loss of Mec1 and Rad24 affects meiotic recombination in different ways. Deletion of Rad24 led to a reduction in recombination frequency and spore viability, likely due to a shortened meiotic prophase. In contrast, loss of Mec1 increased recombination frequency, but had less impact on spore viability. Both Mec1 and Rad24 play a role in regulating the spatial distribution of crossovers (COs), which are essential for proper chromosome segregation. Without Mec1 or Rad24, CO distributions became more random, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation. The study highlights the distinct roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination, with Rad24 acting as a pro-CO factor and Mec1 regulating recombination frequency. The results also suggest that Mec1 helps to suppress broader defects in CO regulation caused by the loss of the DDR. Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of meiotic recombination and the roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in this process.
Researchers have long struggled to culture the fungus Pneumocystis jirovecii in a lab setting, hindering efforts to understand its biology and develop treatments for the life-threatening pneumonia it causes in immunocompromised individuals. To address this challenge, scientists have developed a comprehensive computer model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism. This model, known as a genome-scale metabolic model, uses data from the fungus's genome and existing research to identify the nutrients and conditions necessary for its growth. By analyzing the model, researchers made predictions about the fungus's growth and metabolism, including the critical components of its growth medium and how to supplement it to enhance growth. The model was also used to replicate experiments and identify potential targets for new antifungal drugs. The researchers also developed a similar model for a related fungus, Pneumocystis murina, which infects mice. By using a combination of computer modeling and experimental testing, the researchers hope to overcome the limitations of traditional lab culture methods and gain a deeper understanding of Pneumocystis biology. This could ultimately lead to the development of new treatments and diagnostic tools for Pneumocystis infections.
Researchers studied how a protein called YAP/TAZ affects cell growth in normal and cancer cells. They found that at low cell density, YAP/TAZ promotes cell growth, but at high cell density, a different pathway called the Hippo pathway is activated, which moves YAP/TAZ out of the cell nucleus and stops cell growth. Cancer cells often have much more YAP/TAZ than normal cells, but it's unclear if this extra YAP/TAZ is enough to keep cells growing at high density. To investigate, the researchers created a 3D computer model that simulated how cells interact with each other and how YAP/TAZ affects cell growth. The model showed that a small increase in YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells was enough to keep them growing even at high density, while normal cells stopped growing. This suggests that the extra YAP/TAZ in cancer cells may be a key factor in their ability to keep growing uncontrollably. The researchers believe that their model could be used to better understand how cancer cells grow and to develop new treatments that target YAP/TAZ.
Researchers have discovered that low-complexity domains (LCDs) in eukaryotic proteins and RNAs can drive phase separation into biomolecular condensates. These condensates can transition to solid-like states when their dynamics are disrupted by mutations. To understand how LCD sequences govern condensate dynamics, scientists have developed an energy landscape framework that measures the "stickiness" of sequences. This framework, called the Free Energy Landscape of Stickers (FELaS), uses a continuous scale to analyze the effects of LCD patterns on condensate properties. By varying the complexity of sequences from fully periodic to random, researchers found that highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. The study reveals that maintaining fluidity in condensates requires a minimum sticker periodicity, preventing transitions to glassy or solid-like states. The FELaS framework also explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity through variations in sticker periodicity and strength. This research provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties of biomolecular condensates, shedding light on their dynamics and functional roles. The findings have significant implications for understanding the evolutionary development of phase-separating biomolecules and the role of sequence complexity in governing their behavior.
Researchers studied how teeth develop in mice to understand the process of organ formation. They found that a protein called non-muscle myosin II is essential for the formation of teeth. Myosin II helps cells stick together and move in the same direction, which is necessary for the tooth to take shape. The researchers discovered that a signaling molecule called Shh triggers the activation of myosin II, which in turn promotes cell-cell adhesion and movement. This process is crucial for the formation of the tooth's shape and structure.

The study used the mouse dentition as a model to investigate the role of myosin II and Shh signaling in tooth development. They found that myosin II is necessary for the invagination of the dental epithelium, which is the layer of cells that forms the tooth. The researchers also showed that Shh signaling induces myosin II activation through a pathway involving a protein called AKT. By activating myosin II, Shh signaling promotes cell-cell adhesion and convergent cell movement, which are essential for the proper formation of the tooth.

The study's findings support a model in which Shh signaling is transmitted through myosin II to drive cellular rearrangement and tissue shape changes during tooth development. The researchers suggest that myosin II plays a critical role in maintaining robust cell-cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium. This is consistent with previous studies showing that myosin II-generated forces are essential for the maintenance and growth of adherence junctions in cultured cells.
Researchers have developed a new method called scTGCN, a deep transfer model based on graph convolutional networks, to integrate and analyze large-scale atlas-level single-cell multiomics data. This method enables the combination of different types of measurements, such as gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, even if the data is unpaired. The scTGCN model formulates and aggregates cell-cell relationships and gene expression using graph convolutional networks, which are based on the kinetic relationships between specific regulatory mechanisms of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq).

The scTGCN model uses a multistage transfer learning strategy to address the challenges of integrating large-scale single-cell multiomics data, including the sheer volume of data, extensive cellular diversity, low coverage per cell, and imbalanced cell type distributions. The model is designed to preserve fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets, and it achieves high label transfer accuracy and effective knowledge transfer across different modalities.

The scTGCN model has been tested on mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) and Cellular Indexing of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (CITE-seq). The results show that scTGCN can accurately transfer cell type annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq. This method has the potential to empower the exploration of single-cell omics data and provide new insights into complex biological mechanisms.
Researchers studied the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase, to understand how it is directed into the cell nucleus. The NLS is a short sequence rich in basic amino acids that interacts with importin proteins to facilitate transport. However, identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 (AF3) modeling, the researchers found that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. The researchers identified specific basic residues within Mcm3's NLS that are critical for its function, including positions 2 and 3, which interact with importin alpha. Mutations at these positions result in defective nuclear import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired cell growth. The study highlights the importance of precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS for nuclear transport and chromatin loading.
Ataxin-2 is a gene associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including spinocerebellar ataxia type II, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinsonism. The protein encoded by this gene is a potential therapeutic target for these conditions. Research has shown that Ataxin-2 plays a role in translational activation, repression, mRNA stability, and the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm domain of Ataxin-2 can stimulate mRNA translation and antagonize mRNP-granule assembly.

Experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins revealed that the PAM2 motif, which interacts with polyA-binding protein (PABP), is a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules. In Drosophila, the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions contribute to Ataxin-2-induced cytotoxicity. The data suggest that Ataxin-2 interactions are remodeled during translational control and that structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation and neurodegeneration.

Ataxin-2 has three conserved regions: the LSm domain, the LSm-associated domain (LSM-AD), and the PAM2 motif, which is flanked by extended IDRs. The PAM2 motif and its interactions with PABP are not essential for granule assembly but are required to efficiently recruit Ataxin-2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into Ataxin-2 granules. Ataxin-2 can remain associated with mRNAs across multiple stages, including RNA processing, transport, translation, and translational control.
Scientists have long sought to understand how muscle stem cells (MuSCs) develop and maintain themselves in different parts of the body. MuSCs are crucial for muscle repair and regeneration, but their behavior varies greatly depending on their location. This study investigated the role of two key genes, Pitx2 and Pax7, in the development and maintenance of MuSCs in the extraocular muscles (EOMs) and limb muscles. The researchers used genetically modified mice to delete these genes at different stages of development and observed the effects on MuSCs. They found that Pitx2 is essential for the early development of MuSCs in EOMs, but becomes less important later on. In contrast, Pax7 is crucial for the maintenance of MuSCs in both EOMs and limb muscles, but its absence leads to a greater loss of MuSCs in EOMs. The study also showed that MuSCs in EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not proliferate in the adult, yet EOMs have a higher number of MuSCs. Furthermore, the researchers found that MuSCs in the EOMs of mice with muscular dystrophy do not proliferate, unlike those in limb muscles. This study provides new insights into the unique characteristics of MuSCs in different parts of the body and sheds light on why EOMs are often spared in muscular dystrophy.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called VOCs-INN to simulate the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants among the human population. The algorithm combines epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. VOCs-INN emphasizes learning underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve model optimization and achieve accurate fitting.

The algorithm was tested using reported data from the British Columbia province in Canada and its five internal health agencies. The results showed that VOCs-INN can accurately fit the data and simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. The algorithm also revealed variations in the intensity of control strategies implemented across different regions.

VOCs-INN is a significant contribution to infectious disease modeling, as it leverages available observational data and the underlying physical principles governing infectious disease models to capture the time-varying nature of parameters. The algorithm can accurately fit data and infer complex time-varying parameters by encoding real VOCs infection data, epidemiological transmission mechanisms, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) into neural networks. The researchers aim to integrate VOCs-INN with other advanced machine-learning methods to better fit and predict infectious disease data.
Researchers have developed a new method called CytoSummaryNet to improve the analysis of single-cell data from image-based cell profiling experiments. This approach uses a technique called self-supervised contrastive learning to automatically find the best way to combine data from individual cells into a representative profile for each sample. Unlike traditional methods, which simply average the data from all cells, CytoSummaryNet learns to prioritize high-quality cells and downweight those that are noisy or of poor quality. This results in a more accurate representation of the cell population, leading to improved predictions of a compound's mechanism of action. In tests, CytoSummaryNet outperformed traditional methods by 30-68% in terms of mean average precision. The model requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in most cell profiling datasets, making it easier to apply than previous methods. CytoSummaryNet can be used as a post-processing step to improve the analysis of single-cell data from image-based profiling experiments. The approach has the potential to be applied to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in functional genomics. Overall, CytoSummaryNet provides a more accurate and efficient way to analyze single-cell data, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field.
Researchers have developed a new framework to measure cognitive effort in the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) data. The framework identifies discrete patterns of brain activity, known as EEG microstates, and uses a mathematical approach called optimal transport theory to quantify the effort required to switch between these states. The study applied this framework to a dataset from a spatial Stroop task, a cognitive test that requires participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting aspect. The results showed a correlation between the effort required to switch between brain states and the difficulty of the task. This is the first time this framework has been applied to EEG data, and it provides a new way to quantify cognitive demand in brain activity. The study suggests that this approach can be used to understand the relationship between neural activity patterns, cognitive effort, and behavioral performance. The findings have implications for understanding how the brain adapts to different tasks and how cognitive impairments, such as those seen in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may be related to changes in brain activity patterns. This research opens up new perspectives for describing cognitive effort within the brain and may lead to the development of new treatments for cognitive impairments. The framework can be used to investigate changes in brain activity during tasks and determine if the effort required to switch between brain states can explain the variation in energy the brain needs to supply for different cognitive demands.
Researchers have discovered that individuals exposed to malaria develop a specific type of immune cell called atypical memory B cells (aMBCs). These cells play a crucial role in producing antibodies that can neutralize the malaria parasite. The study focused on Plasmodium vivax, a type of malaria parasite that affects millions of people worldwide. The researchers created probes to detect the development and persistence of aMBCs in individuals infected with P. vivax. They found that aMBCs were present during and after the infection, and some of these cells produced antibodies that could neutralize the parasite.

The researchers isolated individual aMBCs and cultured them to study their ability to produce antibodies. They found that some aMBCs produced high levels of antibodies that could neutralize the parasite, similar to classical MBCs. The study also found that the B cell receptors of aMBCs expressed unique genes, similar to classical MBCs. The researchers identified two aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11, that produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against different variants of the parasite.

The study suggests that aMBCs play an important role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. The findings have implications for the development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines. The researchers propose that identifying aMBC subsets that produce protective antibodies could lead to the creation of more effective vaccines. The study provides new insights into the immune response to malaria and highlights the importance of aMBCs in producing antibodies that can neutralize the parasite.
Researchers have developed a new method called mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model, to improve polygenic prediction of complex traits in human genetics. Unlike mr. mash, which requires individual-level data, mr. mash-rss uses summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel. This allows mr. mash-rss to be applied to data sets that are not publicly available and makes it scalable to large biobank data sets. Through simulations, the researchers showed that mr. mash-rss is competitive with and often outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios. They also analyzed real data from 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank and found that mr. mash-rss achieved higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set had a smaller sample size. The researchers demonstrated that mr. mash-rss is robust to a small to medium amount of missing phenotypes and can be fitted efficiently in specific cases. Overall, mr. mash-rss addresses the limitations of mr. mash, including the need for individual-level data and lack of scalability to large data sets, making it a valuable tool for polygenic prediction in human genetics.
Researchers have developed a new modeling framework to improve the accuracy of epidemic predictions by incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity into traditional homogeneous models. The framework uses a continuous recruitment process for susceptible individuals and a neural network to approximate the recruitment rate. This Universal Differential Equations (UDE) model was trained using data from the COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai, China, and compared to a traditional homogeneous model. The results showed that the UDE model provided an 18.6% improvement in prediction accuracy, with an attack rate of 80.06% and a peak of new infections of 3.17% of the population, compared to the homogeneous model's projections of 99.97% and 32.78%. The study also found that heterogeneity in the susceptible population decreases herd immunity for approximately 37.36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from 30 days to 70 days. The researchers believe that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modeling heterogeneity. The UDE model was trained using deep learning methods, while a mechanistic model was calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. The study's findings suggest that incorporating spatio-temporal heterogeneity into traditional models can lead to more accurate predictions and a better understanding of epidemic trends.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain are surprisingly noisy, leading to high trial-by-trial variability. This study proposes that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainties about the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework was developed to show how synapses interact with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron, similar to an agent in an uncertain environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics, updated by a synaptic learning rule similar to established mechanisms like LTP/LTD. The study also shows that synapses can encode their uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential using their inherently noisy synaptic release. When many synapses in a network work together, they can resolve learning problems like pattern classification and closed-loop control in dynamic environments. This coordination enables the network to represent and utilize uncertainties in behaviorally ambiguous situations. The research suggests that noisy synaptic transmission is not a flaw, but a feature that allows synapses to effectively encode and utilize uncertainties. The study provides precise predictions about the interplay of synaptic and neural dynamics, including synaptic plasticity changes in post-pre-post spike pairing protocols. A synaptic learning rule was derived by minimizing surprise in individual synapses, enabling them to adapt their efficacy to predict future postsynaptic spikes. The study also shows that synaptic variability can be used to reflect uncertainty in neural firing, with the postsynaptic neuron learning to fire according to Gaussian distributions of firing times.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scuphr to reconstruct cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method is designed to overcome challenges associated with single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. Scuphr uses a distance-based approach and the neighbor-joining algorithm to compute the distance between cell pairs and reconstruct the lineage tree. The method is faster and more accurate than existing state-of-the-art methods, thanks to its embarrassingly parallel design. The researchers tested Scuphr on synthetic and biological datasets, including a dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage tree topology. The results show that Scuphr can accurately reconstruct the lineage tree, even when the cells are closely related and have few distinguishing mutations. Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies have the potential to reveal more point mutations than other data types, but they also come with challenges such as distinguishing somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification. Scuphr is designed to address these challenges and provide a more accurate and efficient way to reconstruct cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. The method has the potential to be used in studies of development, differentiation, and cancer progression.
Researchers have proposed a new tool, the Thanzi La Onse (TLO) model, to help evaluate health benefits packages (HBPs) in low-income settings like Malawi. HBPs aim to determine which healthcare services should be included in the public healthcare system to improve population health outcomes. The TLO model simulates the impact of different HBP strategies on disease incidence, health-seeking behavior, and the healthcare system's capacity to meet demand for care, taking into account realistic constraints on human resources for health.

The study used the TLO model to evaluate several plausible HBP strategies for Malawi and found that a linear constrained optimization analysis (LCOA) approach achieved the largest health gain, reducing disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) by approximately 8% between 2023 and 2042 compared to a benchmark scenario. However, this approach incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of implementation.

An alternative approach, prioritizing services based on patient characteristics rather than service type, achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period. This suggests that prioritizing services based on patient characteristics might be a beneficial approach in the future. The TLO model provides a unique tool for testing HBPs specifically designed for Malawi, allowing for detailed evaluations of the health gains that can be achieved through the relative prioritization of services given realistic constraints in available human resources for health.
Researchers studied the process of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation in the pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and compared it to the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori. They used a technique called Oligopaint DNA FISH to visualize single chromosomes at high resolution. The study found that in both species, meiotic homolog pairing is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, a mechanism previously observed in Bombyx. This suggests that this mechanism may be conserved in Lepidopteran insects.

The researchers also found that both species form rod-shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple ways at metaphase I. In both species, kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. This challenges the classical view of segregation, where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I.

The study found clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting the separated kinetochores. This suggests that moths employ a novel "center-kinetic" segregation mechanism during spermatogenesis, where kinetochore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome. The findings highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems, which can lead to the discovery of novel biology.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for a type of brain cell called NG2-glia in the median eminence (ME), a region at the base of the hypothalamus that connects the brain to the pituitary gland. The ME is essential for controlling hormone production in the pituitary gland, which regulates various bodily functions such as growth, metabolism, and reproductive processes. A mutation in the SOX3 gene, which affects the development and function of NG2-glia in the ME, leads to hypopituitarism, a condition characterized by reduced hormone production in the pituitary gland.

Studies have shown that the absence of SOX3 affects NG2-glia in the ME, leading to impaired hormone production in the pituitary gland, particularly in juvenile animals. The researchers found that low-dose aspirin treatment and changes in the gut microbiome can rescue the proliferative defects and hypopituitarism caused by the SOX3 mutation. This suggests that NG2-glia play a critical role in the ME's function during a transitional period of post-natal development.

The study highlights a novel role for NG2-glia in the post-weaning formation of a functional ME and its control of pituitary maturation. The researchers propose that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning. The findings indicate that an otherwise robust phenotype due to loss of SOX3 in these cells can be modified by non-genetic factors, such as low-dose aspirin treatment or changes in the gut microbiome.
Researchers studied the proteins that control the movement of cells during the development of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm. They focused on the protein CED-10/Rac1, which is essential for cell movement, and the protein CED-5/CED-12, which is thought to activate CED-10/Rac1. However, the researchers found that CED-5/CED-12 actually inhibits F-actin, a protein that helps cells move, during embryonic cell migration. This was unexpected, as CED-5/CED-12 is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 during the engulfment of dying cells. To understand how CED-5/CED-12 can have opposite effects on F-actin, the researchers investigated whether it also has a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) function. They found that CED-12 has a GAP region that is separate from its GEF (guanine-nucleotide exchange factor) region. Mutating this GAP region affected cell migration, but not the engulfment of dying cells. The researchers also found that CED-5/CED-12 supports the cycling of multiple GTPases, which are proteins that help cells move, by using distinct domains to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation. This suggests that CED-5/CED-12 plays a complex role in regulating cell movement during embryonic development. The researchers propose that CED-5/CED-12 uses its GEF function to activate CED-10/Rac1 for corpse engulfment, and its GAP function to inhibit F-actin during embryonic cell migration.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes information across different timescales, specifically in the rodent visual system. They used a combination of information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to examine the timescales of spiking activity in the mouse visual cortex under visual stimulation. The results showed that information and correlation timescales increased along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. This suggests that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.

The researchers tested whether the observed increase in timescales was gradual, following the anatomical hierarchy, or parallel, reflecting an organization into two stages. They found that a model with a gradual increase had more predictive power for both correlation and information timescales, indicating a hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the mouse visual cortex.

The study also explored the role of intrinsic mechanisms, such as recurrent coupling, in shaping the temporal processing hierarchy. The results suggest that an increase in recurrent coupling can lead to a reduction of temporal correlations from external stimuli and a decrease in predictability. This indicates that network-intrinsic mechanisms are important for shaping the temporal processing hierarchy, in addition to stimulus encoding and complex feature representations. Overall, the study provides insights into how the brain processes information across different timescales and the role of intrinsic mechanisms in achieving efficient neural coding.
Researchers used a non-invasive brain stimulation technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to study the neural circuits involved in motor function. They used recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract to develop a computational model of the motor cortex, which allowed them to investigate the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS. The study found that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves, with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons playing a role. The researchers used machine learning to identify common circuit features among these pathways and found that the total conduction delay of the shortest path to layer 5 pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs) determined the latency of the corticospinal wave. They also found that activation of specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, which are a type of corticospinal wave. The study suggests that the cortical origins of afferents that give rise to certain I-waves may be related to the activation of both afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types within the motor cortex. The researchers developed a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure, which can be used to identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation. The study provides new insights into the neural circuits involved in motor function and has implications for the development of new treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfpDNA) is present in the maternal bloodstream throughout pregnancy, making it a valuable tool for research and clinical applications. CfpDNA is shed into the maternal circulation as early as the fourth week of gestation and can comprise up to 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA. Since its discovery in 1997, cfpDNA has been used in noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic abnormalities, such as chromosomal aneuploidies. However, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility.

CfpDNA is representative of the full placental genome, providing a means for noninvasive genome-wide characterization of the placenta. NIPT has been widely implemented to screen for common fetal aneuploidies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21, by assessing for overrepresentation of the affected chromosomes in maternal plasma cell-free DNA. The effectiveness of NIPT for aneuploidy screening has been reviewed elsewhere.

Studying cfpDNA can improve our understanding of placental physiological processes, the functional role of cfpDNA in pregnancy, and how cfpDNA can be used to study and monitor placental health and disease. CfpDNA can also be a powerful research tool for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, which are currently hindered by ethical constraints and limited availability of early- and mid-gestation tissue samples. This can open avenues for many more clinical applications of cfpDNA beyond the current NIPT repertoire, which is limited to genetic screening of the fetus.
Researchers have identified a common genetic basis for four types of hormone-dependent cancers: breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancer. These cancers share several risk factors, suggesting a shared underlying cause. By analyzing data from genome-wide association studies, the researchers found that genetic variants associated with these cancers tend to cluster together in specific regions of the genome, rather than being scattered randomly. This clustering suggests that there may be common target genes that contribute to the development of these cancers.

The study identified 44 regions of the genome that are associated with multiple hormone-dependent cancers, with some regions containing genetic variants linked to all four types of cancer. The researchers used a combination of genetic and epigenetic data to identify 53 candidate genes at these regions that may play a role in the development of hormone-dependent cancers. Many of these genes have not been previously linked to cancer, and some are involved in regulating the activity of other genes.

The study also found that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) may play a role in the development of hormone-dependent cancers, and identified several lncRNAs that are associated with multiple types of cancer. Additionally, the researchers found that some of the genetic variants associated with hormone-dependent cancers alter the activity of transcription factors, which are proteins that regulate gene expression. This suggests that these variants may contribute to the development of cancer by disrupting normal gene regulation. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic basis of hormone-dependent cancers and identifies potential targets for the development of new treatments.
Researchers have identified a genetic link to polymyositis, a muscle disease, in the Kooiker dog breed. A genome-wide association study found that a region on chromosome CFA19 was associated with the disease. Further analysis revealed a 39-kilobase deletion in the DNA of affected dogs, located 10 kilobases upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. These genes play a role in regulating the immune system. The deletion was found in 81% of affected dogs and 25% of a random sample of the Kooiker breed. Leukocytes from affected dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL2 when stimulated with mitogens. This suggests that the deletion may be a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. The study estimates that 10-20% of dogs homozygous for the deletion will develop the disease, while 0.5-2% of dogs heterozygous for the deletion will be affected. The findings also suggest that distant variants upstream of the IL21 gene may be important in human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region. A PCR assay has been developed to genotype the deletion allele in Kooiker dogs, providing a tool for breeders to prevent the birth of high-risk dogs and reduce the incidence of polymyositis in the breed.
Researchers have developed a new protein language model called ESMtherm to predict the stability of proteins, which is crucial for various applications such as food processing, therapeutics, and identifying disease-causing mutations. The model is trained on a massive dataset of 528,000 protein sequences and can handle deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. By fine-tuning the model, the researchers showed that it can accurately predict the folding stability of small protein domains and generalize to sequences that are not part of the training set.

The study also found that training the model on an ensemble of protein domains, rather than a single domain, improves its performance in predicting folding stability. Additionally, the researchers demonstrated the benefits of training the model on a large dataset of protein sequences, rather than focusing on a single wild-type protein. However, the model's performance on larger protein scaffolds lags behind other state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the need for a larger dataset of stability measurements for longer protein sequences.

The researchers used the ESM-2 model as a starting point and fine-tuned it to create ESMtherm, which performs comparably to other state-of-the-art models on small protein sequences. The model's ability to generalize to sequences distal from the training set shows the potential of transfer learning to reduce the experimental burden in protein stability prediction. Overall, the study demonstrates the feasibility of using a protein language model to predict folding stability and highlights the importance of large-scale stability measurements for improving the generalizability of such models.
Researchers investigated the role of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRs) in autoimmunity, specifically in Type 1 diabetes (T1D). iKIRs are a family of receptors expressed by natural killer cells and some T cells that regulate immune responses. The study aimed to determine if iKIRs affect the T cell response in T1D, a disease where T cells play a major role. The researchers analyzed a dataset of 11,961 individuals with T1D and found that iKIR genes, in combination with genes encoding their ligands, have a significant impact on protective Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) class II genetic associations. This suggests that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. The study's findings were validated in an independent dataset. The researchers conclude that iKIRs decrease HLA class II protective associations, which could have implications for understanding the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity. This study builds on previous research showing that iKIRs enhance protective and detrimental HLA associations in chronic viral infections. The findings suggest that iKIRs may play a similar role in autoimmunity, and further research is needed to explore this interaction in other autoimmune diseases.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), a leading cause of vision loss in older adults. FECD is caused by the expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element, known as CTG18.1, within the TCF4 gene. This expansion disrupts the normal functioning of the corneal endothelial cells, leading to vision loss. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease have been challenging to decipher due to the non-coding nature of the repeat and the complexity of the TCF4 gene.

Using a large cohort of primary corneal endothelial cells from individuals with and without CTG18.1 expansions, researchers employed advanced transcriptomic techniques to investigate the molecular components of FECD. The study revealed that CTG18.1 expansions lead to altered splicing and differential gene expression in corneal endothelial cells. Furthermore, the researchers found that TCF4 isoform dysregulation is a key feature of FECD, particularly in individuals with CTG18.1 expansions.

Interestingly, the study also identified rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants in individuals without CTG18.1 expansions, suggesting that TCF4 dysregulation may be a risk factor for FECD independent of the CTG18.1 expansion. The findings of this study provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying FECD and highlight the importance of TCF4 dysregulation in the disease. The research has the potential to inform the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease.
Researchers have identified a gene called GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h (GF14h) that plays a crucial role in low-temperature germination (LTG) in rice. LTG is essential for direct seeding, a method that bypasses the labor-intensive process of transplanting rice seedlings. The team used a technique called QTL-seq to find the genetic basis of LTG in a Portuguese rice variety called Arroz da Terra. They discovered a 52-kilobase region containing the GF14h gene, which is expressed during seed germination.

The researchers found that the Arroz da Terra variety has a functional GF14h allele, while a Japanese rice variety called Hitomebore has a 4-base pair deletion in the coding region. By knocking out the functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele, they observed a decrease in LTG. Conversely, overexpressing the functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG. This suggests that GF14h is the causal gene behind LTG.

Further analysis revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular Japanese rice varieties during modern breeding. The researchers generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kilobase genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra, including the GF14h gene. This NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with comparable agronomic traits. The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers investigated the structure of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) and its role in the formation of covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), the persistent form of the virus genome. They created a mutant HBV cell line with a specific mutation in the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) coding sequence, which altered the sequence of the 3' terminal redundancy (TR) of the negative strand DNA. Despite the mutation, the production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in the mutant cells was comparable to wild-type levels. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed that the positive strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wild-type nucleotide at position 1822, indicating that the 5' TR of the negative strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the positive strand DNA. The 3' TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. The study also found that the 3' flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation, alongside the 5' flap endonuclease FEN1. The researchers mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA and found that the overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5' and 3' flaps formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursors. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms, contributing to our understanding of the HBV replication cycle.
Researchers have developed a new model to study how microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) adapt to changing conditions. MFCs are used to treat industrial wastewater, but their performance can be disrupted by changes in the microbial community. The new model, called mmGEM, simulates the interactions between different types of microorganisms in MFCs. The study focused on MFCs treating wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory, which contains high levels of sulfide.

The researchers found that as the amount of organic matter in the wastewater increased, the microbial community shifted from being dominated by sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) to being dominated by methanogens (MET). This shift led to a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM model accurately predicted the changes in the microbial community and the impact on MFC performance. The model showed that SOB growth was limited at high organic loading rates due to reduced sulfate-sulfide cycling and acetate cross-feeding with sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB).

The model also revealed that SRB diverted more cross-fed metabolites to MET, allowing them to dominate the community. The researchers used the model to simulate the impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance. The study highlights the importance of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high organic loading rates. The findings can inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments.
Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to guide biological discovery in biomedicine, such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. However, ML models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives when applied to unseen situations. To address this issue, a new framework called CPEC has been proposed, which integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conformal prediction. CPEC provides accurate and controlled false discovery rate (FDR) predictions for biological systems, ensuring that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability.

CPEC was tested using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. The results showed that CPEC achieved reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. This framework is expected to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited.

CPEC allows users to specify their desired FDR tolerance, tailored to the experiment budget or goals, and makes corresponding predictions with a controlled FDR. This framework addresses the challenge of developing ML models with interpretable uncertainty quantification of predictions, which is essential for the efficiency and reliability of ML-assisted biological discovery.
Researchers investigated the role of the Hsp90 chaperone in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 protein in neurons. Using a C. elegans model of familial ALS, they found that disrupting Hsp90 function genetically or with small molecule inhibitors protected against TDP-43 neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. This protection was accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein levels. The study suggests that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo.

The researchers used C. elegans models that express human ALS-causing mutations in TDP-43 pan-neuronally, which exhibit progressive motility defects, motor neuron degeneration, and accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43. They found that Hsp90 inhibition induced the overexpression of other heat shock proteins, including Hsp70 and Hsp-16.1, and that normal levels of Hsp-16.1 were required for Hsp90 mutation effects on TDP-43. The study also found that the neuroprotective effect of Hsp90 dysfunction did not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans.

These findings demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS. The study suggests that Hsp90 inhibition may be a potential therapeutic strategy for ALS, as it can facilitate the clearance of TDP-43 by releasing the transcription factor HSF-1, which activates the heat shock response.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the adult female reproductive system of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, using a technique called single-nucleus RNA sequencing. This allowed them to identify the different cell types present in the ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells, and compare them to the ovary of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. The study found that many of the expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function are highly conserved between the two species, despite being separated by over 500 million years of evolution.

The researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to investigate the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of germ cells during oogenesis. They identified clusters of cells with distinct expression patterns and found that they share different levels of expression-based homology with the Drosophila ovarian clusters. This suggests that the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in the female reproductive system are highly conserved across different species.

The study also explored the unique regulatory programs and chromatin accessibility in the different cell types of the Artemia ovary. Additionally, the researchers investigated the gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis, highlighting its unique regulatory dynamics and the presence of meiotic sex chromosome silencing in this group. This work provides new insights into the biology of the female reproductive system and highlights the potential of single-nucleus RNA sequencing as a powerful tool for studying complex biological systems.
Chronic pain is a widespread and debilitating condition that affects millions of people worldwide, with allodynia being a common symptom where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses. Researchers have proposed that allodynia is caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. To investigate this, scientists analyzed biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. They used neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions.

The study found that disruption of E-I balance in the subcircuits generally occurs due to either the downregulation of inhibitory signaling or the upregulation of excitatory neuron responses. The specific mechanisms, subcircuit components involved, and proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure. The results suggest that allodynia may be caused by multiple mechanisms, which could explain the high interindividual variability observed in the condition. The study provides specific hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of allodynia and identifies potential targets for further experimental studies. Understanding the physiological causes of allodynia is crucial for developing effective treatments for chronic pain conditions.
Researchers investigated the role of Hsp90 and its cochaperones in regulating the function of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a crucial protein involved in protein translation. They found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in mediating eEF2 function. Some mutations in Hsp90 or cochaperones reduced the steady-state levels of eEF2, while others affected the sensitivity of eEF2 to diphtheria toxin. The results suggest that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not only by assisting protein folding but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. The study also found that yeast Hsp90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects that correlate with defects in subsets of cochaperones, indicating that there may be different versions of the Hsp90 folding pathway that chaperone different types of clients. The researchers identified Hgh1 as a protein that bridges the interaction of eEF2 with either Cns1 and Hsp90 or with the TRiC chaperone. The study provides evidence that Hsp90 has critical roles in translation elongation in addition to translation initiation and suggests that understanding the differences in how clients interact with Hsp90 and cochaperones could provide insight into potential mechanisms of selective inhibition of Hsp90 function.
Researchers investigated how people make decisions in social situations when their individual preferences about risk are disrupted or inaccessible. They studied individuals with lesions in the insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, areas of the brain involved in risky decision-making. Participants played a gambling task where they made choices alone and after observing others' choices. The results showed that individuals with brain lesions had difficulty using standard calculations to evaluate risky options. However, they were more likely to follow the choices of others in social situations. This suggests that people may rely on following others' choices as a way to make decisions when their own risk assessment abilities are impaired. The study found a correlation between the degree of impairment in utility-based decision-making and the use of the "follow others" heuristic. Individuals who were most disrupted in their ability to make utility-based decisions were more likely to conform to others' choices. This relationship was also observed in a separate group of participants without brain lesions, providing further evidence for the idea that there is a trade-off between using complex decision-making processes and simpler heuristics in social situations. The findings have implications for understanding how people make decisions in situations where their risk assessment abilities are compromised, such as in certain psychopathologies or when facing novel options.
Researchers have re-examined Richard Dawkins's iconic model of morphological evolution, known as biomorphs, to understand how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes. They found that biomorphs exhibit a phenomenon called phenotype bias, where certain phenotypes are much more likely to appear through random mutations than others. This bias favors simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. An information-theoretic principle explains this bias as a result of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. Using population genetics simulations, the researchers demonstrated that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently through random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent. This result is similar to findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps. The study also found that biomorphs exhibit high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness. These patterns can be explained by an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome. The researchers suggest that the simplicity bias and other patterns observed in biomorphs may hold more widely for developmental systems.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, which cannot be predicted analytically. They used a numerical mode tool to compute the nonlinear normal modes (NNM) of energy-conservative systems and compared them to the motions excited by human participants. In a user study, participants controlled a virtual double pendulum with a haptic joystick, aiming to hit targets aligned with or offset from the NNM. The results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM, even when targets were located away from the NNM. This suggests that humans can apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness. The study provides data-based evidence for human resonance sensitivity in nonlinear systems, extending existing research on this topic. The findings have implications for understanding human capabilities in dynamic interactions with complex systems.
In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators (TSRs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. Two TSRs, ScoC and AbrB, along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR, were found to negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin. Genetic analysis revealed that all three transcription factors are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. The expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under the control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR, and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background. Biochemical analysis showed that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates, indicating tight regulation of pulcherrimin production. The results suggest that PchR and AbrB act as roadblocks to RNA polymerase progression at the yvmC promoter, while ScoC has a weak direct regulatory role and may also have indirect regulation through another factor. The presence of the three repressors is necessary to limit the production of pulcherrimin, providing insight into the regulatory network of pulcherrimin production in bacteria.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how spinal cord injuries (SCIs) affect bladder function and how a treatment called transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) can improve it. After an SCI, some people develop detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the injury. DSD and incontinence occur when the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and the urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet, do not work together properly.

The researchers created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, which replicated normal bladder function. They then added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI. The model was able to replicate the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI and the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that occurs with TMS treatment.

The study found that low-frequency TMS (1 Hz) normalized control of voiding after SCI, while high-frequency TMS (30 Hz) enhanced urine storage. The researchers concluded that neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition and that both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms of TMS treatment. The study provides a framework for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling micturition after SCI and the effects of TMS on the spinal cord.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model to estimate the growth rate of a type of fungus called Aspergillus fumigatus. This fungus is a common cause of severe infections, and understanding its growth rate is crucial for effective treatment. Current methods for measuring fungal growth are often time-consuming and require specialized equipment, making them impractical for most clinical microbiology laboratories. The new model uses a simpler method called optical density (OD600) to estimate growth rates. OD600 measures the amount of light that passes through a culture of the fungus, which is an indirect indicator of growth. The model takes into account that OD600 is not a direct measure of growth, allowing it to accurately estimate growth rates without the need for calibration data. The researchers tested the model using data from Aspergillus fumigatus cultures and found that it outperformed other models in predicting growth rates. The model's ability to estimate growth rates from OD600 data makes it accessible to all microbiology laboratories, not just those with specialized equipment. This could lead to more accurate diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections.
Beetles are the most diverse group of animals, with over 400,000 known species, and many more yet to be discovered. Despite their diversity, most beetles have XY sex chromosomes, but some groups have X0 sex determination mechanisms. Researchers have generated a whole-chromosome assembly of the beetle Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and analyzed the genomes of 11 other beetle species to study karyotype evolution.

The study found that ancestral linkage groups, called Stevens elements, are shared across beetles and contain a conserved set of genes. The ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, but independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes have occurred, resulting in neo-sex chromosomes. These neo-sex chromosomes have evolved the typical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression.

The study suggests that beetles will be a valuable model system for understanding the evolution of sex chromosomes. The researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera and found that the ancestral X chromosome is conserved, but multiple independent formations of neo-sex chromosomes have occurred, even among closely related species. The study highlights the importance of comparative analysis to understand the prevalence of these patterns and the evolutionary forces driving them across species.
Researchers investigated the role of H2A.Z, a histone variant, in gene expression regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H2A.Z is incorporated into chromatin by the SWR1-complex (SWR1-C) and has been implicated in transcription regulation. However, previous studies on H2A.Z's role in gene expression have been confounded by the deleterious effects of SWR1-C when it is missing its H2A.Z substrate. To address this, the researchers examined the mRNA transcript profiles of wild-type, htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (HU), which induces DNA replication stress. The results showed that H2A.Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. The study also found that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Mapping H2A.Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A.Z enrichment at transcription start sites were correlated with, but not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure. Overall, the study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A.Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU and provided new insights into the role of H2A.Z in gene expression regulation in S. cerevisiae.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNASeq) data plays a crucial role in understanding developmental biology, but classifying transcriptomic profiles into cell types and identifying lineage relationships is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the data and the difficulty of obtaining fully annotated datasets. To address this challenge, researchers propose using partial label learning, a method that uses a set of candidate labels for each data point, rather than a single correct label. This approach is more feasible than traditional supervised learning methods, which require fully annotated datasets. The researchers extend state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, and logistic regression, to the partial label learning framework and study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods. They focus on the hierarchical structure of labels, commonly observed in developmental processes. The results show that these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. The performances of the methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same level as those trained with fully supervised data. The researchers also study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on its effect on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods. Overall, the findings demonstrate the potential of hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies to solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles.
Researchers have found that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) plays a crucial role in the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli, which are essential for gene expression. PIP2 is found in these compartments and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription. The study discovered that the localization of PIP2 in the nucleus is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA. By using mass spectrometry, the researchers identified a set of proteins that associate with PIP2 in an RNA-dependent manner, known as RNA-dependent PIP2-associated (RDPA) proteins. These proteins have intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs, which are enriched for post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination. One of these RDPA proteins, Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), was found to associate with PIP2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions. The study suggests that PIP2 acts as a molecular wedge to attract and retain different sets of RDPA proteins to specific nuclear subpopulations, such as nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipid islets. The researchers propose that PIP2 plays a pivotal role in establishing a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression by spatiotemporally orchestrating nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins.
Researchers studied the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, a group of insects known for their diverse and adaptable traits. They sequenced the genomes of three dung beetle species and compared them to those of other beetles to identify genetic changes associated with metabolic regulation and plasticity. The study found that changes in the non-coding genome, which contains regulatory elements that control gene expression, play a key role in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits.

The researchers focused on the development of head horns in dung beetles, which are secondary sexual weapons that exhibit significant variation within and between species. They found that the non-coding genome contains regulatory elements that are sensitive to nutrition and sex, and that these elements are involved in the formation of head horns. The study also identified candidate transcription factors that bind to these regulatory elements, providing new insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying the evolution of plastic traits.

The study highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, and demonstrates that gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. The research provides new reference-quality genomes for three dung beetle species, which will facilitate future studies on the development, ecology, and evolution of this insect group. The findings have implications for our understanding of the genetic basis of phenotypic plasticity and its role in adaptation and trait diversification.
Researchers used a monkey model to study Lassa fever, a viral disease that can cause severe illness and death. The study aimed to understand why some people recover from the disease while others die. The researchers infected monkeys with two different strains of the Lassa virus and observed the progression of the disease. They found that the virus first replicates in the lymphoid organs, which are part of the immune system, and then spreads to other parts of the body. In monkeys that died from the disease, the virus spread to almost all organs and caused an excessive inflammatory response, leading to death. In contrast, monkeys that survived the disease had a more limited spread of the virus to a few organs. The study suggests that the severity of the disease depends on how the virus spreads and how the immune system responds. The researchers also found that certain strains of the virus, such as the AV strain, cause less severe disease than others, such as the Josiah strain. This study provides new insights into the pathogenesis of Lassa fever and the immune mechanisms that determine the outcome of the disease. The findings could help in the development of treatments and vaccines for Lassa fever, which is a significant public health concern in West Africa.
Researchers have identified a potential underlying cause of several neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration (FTD/FTLD), and Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). These diseases are characterized by the disruption of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT), a process that regulates the movement of proteins in and out of the cell nucleus. Specifically, the study found that the protein Importin-β, which plays a crucial role in NCT, is mislocalized and aggregated in the cytoplasm of cells in these diseases. This mislocalization leads to the accumulation of other proteins, including TDP43, Ran, and RanGAP1, which are also implicated in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The study used two novel mouse models of neurodegeneration, NemfR86S and NemfR487G, to investigate the role of Importin-β in NCT. The results showed that impaired Importin-β nuclear import leads to defects in NCT, resulting in the mislocalization and aggregation of these proteins. Furthermore, the study found that transient inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human cells induces proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations similar to those seen in neurodegenerative diseases. These findings suggest that Importin-β nuclear import deficiency may be a primary upstream cause of the protein mislocalization and transcriptional dysregulation seen in these diseases.
Scientists have been exploring the potential of lytic bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, for medical and biotechnological applications. To better understand how these phages work, researchers need to study their infection mechanisms. One way to do this is by using CRISPR-Cas systems, which allow for precise editing of phage DNA. However, phages can resist CRISPR-Cas by modifying their DNA with cytosine glycosylation, making it harder to edit. To overcome this, researchers used an enzyme called NgTET to temporarily reduce these modifications, making it easier for CRISPR-Cas to edit the phage DNA. This approach allowed for precise targeting and seamless integration of point mutations into the phage genome. The researchers used this method to disable specific enzymes in the T4 phage that are crucial for infection. By temporarily removing DNA modifications, they were also able to study the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without deleting genes. This new approach enables the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlines the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications, which is valuable for synthetic biology and understanding phage infection mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a new player in the process of repairing DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) light. The study, conducted in yeast cells, found that a histone variant called H2A.Z plays a crucial role in maintaining genome stability after UV exposure. Histones are proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin, and H2A.Z is a specific type of histone that helps regulate gene expression.

When cells are exposed to UV light, it can cause bulky DNA lesions that interfere with transcription and replication. To repair these lesions, cells use a process called transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). The study found that H2A.Z is essential for efficient TC-NER and helps clear RNA polymerase II, an enzyme involved in transcription, from the damaged area. Without H2A.Z, cells are unable to repair DNA damage properly, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks, which can be catastrophic for the cell.

The researchers used a genetic screen to identify H2A.Z as a key component of TC-NER. They found that yeast cells lacking H2A.Z are more sensitive to UV light and accumulate double-strand breaks. The study suggests that H2A.Z helps create a DNA repair-optimized chromatin environment, which is essential for maintaining genome stability. The findings have implications for understanding how cells respond to DNA damage and could lead to new insights into the development of cancer therapies.
Researchers analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule of Drosophila melanogaster from two divergent populations to understand how genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues. They found that gene expression was highly tissue- and genetic background-specific, with tissue-specific effects being stronger than genetic background-specific effects. The two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele-specific expression revealed that trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects in genes expressed differentially between populations. This suggests that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence. The study also found that the genetic basis of expression variation and the mode of expression inheritance were highly tissue- and genetic background-specific. The results demonstrate that even functionally related, interconnected tissues can show highly divergent regulatory architecture among tissues and genetic backgrounds. Overall, the study provides new insights into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, and the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the timing of the emergence of emerging diseases, such as COVID-19, by analyzing early reported cases. This approach uses a population dynamics model to simulate the spread of the disease and estimate the delay between the first infection and the detection of the Nth case. The method was validated using simulated data and then applied to two real-world examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019. The results suggest that the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan occurred on November 28, 2019, with a 95% confidence interval of November 2-December 9, 2019. This estimate is consistent with previous studies that used genomic data to date the emergence of the pandemic. The researchers' approach is flexible and can be applied to other outbreaks, making it a valuable tool for understanding the timing of emerging diseases. The study highlights the importance of quantifying the time it takes for emerging epidemics to remain undetected before the first cases are reported, which is particularly relevant for diseases like COVID-19 where many early cases may be asymptomatic.
Researchers have developed a computer model to study how chromosomes pair up during meiosis, a process essential for sexual reproduction. Meiosis involves the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, and pairing of homologous chromosomes (homologs) is crucial for this process. However, the mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of non-homologous chromosomes have remained unclear. The model, based on the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble, simulates unidirectional chromosome movements and collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces. The study found that chromosome number, size, movement velocity, and repulsive forces are key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing, in addition to homolog attraction. The model also suggests that dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes contributes to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area, creating conditions for close-range homolog attraction. The model accurately recapitulates the efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed in wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to other organisms with different nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of homolog pairing during meiosis and highlights the importance of repulsive forces in dissociating non-homologous chromosomes.
Researchers studied the role of microRNA miR-34a in cancer development in zebrafish. MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression. The study found that miR-34a is a target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, which is often mutated in human cancers. Zebrafish without miR-34a (miR-34a-/-) did not develop cancer, but when combined with a mutated p53 gene, they were more prone to cancer. This suggests that miR-34a has a tumor-suppressive function. The study also found that miR-34a is highly conserved between zebrafish and humans, indicating its importance in cancer development. In zebrafish, miR-34a was induced by DNA damage, which activates p53. However, miR-34a mutants were viable and had normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-34a in zebrafish embryos made them more sensitive to DNA damage, but not to radiation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that miR-34a has small but significant effects on gene expression in zebrafish embryos under normal and DNA damage conditions. The study also found that loss of miR-34a enhanced erythrocyte levels and up-regulated myb-positive hematopoietic stem cells in zebrafish. Overall, the study provides evidence for the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a and its role in regulating gene expression in zebrafish.
A recent study on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has shed new light on the role of the master regulator XOL-1 in sex determination and embryonic development. In C. elegans, sex is determined by the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, with hermaphrodites having two X chromosomes and males having one. XOL-1 is known to regulate sex determination and dosage compensation in males, but its role in hermaphrodites was thought to be minimal. However, the study found that XOL-1 plays a crucial role in regulating developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis.

The researchers used a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques to analyze the effects of XOL-1 loss in hermaphrodite embryos. They found that XOL-1 mutant embryos had an accelerated rate of cell division and a more advanced transcriptional program compared to wild-type embryos. Further analysis revealed that XOL-1 regulates the timing of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes and the expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. The study also found that the loss of XOL-1 led to the overexpression of the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and an altered H3K9me landscape, which was partially reversed by the loss of MET-2.

These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 is a critical regulator of embryonic development in both males and hermaphrodites, and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites. The study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of sex determination and dosage compensation in C. elegans and highlights the importance of XOL-1 in regulating embryonic development.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurvE (Mosquito Gene SurveillancE) to optimize the placement of mosquito traps for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations. This is particularly relevant for gene drive projects, which aim to control mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. MGSurvE takes into account various factors, including the resources required by mosquitoes, their movement patterns, and the attractiveness of different traps. The framework uses discrete optimization to minimize the time it takes to detect a specific allele of interest, which is crucial for preventing the unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes and the emergence of resistant alleles.

MGSurvE has been applied to two case studies: an Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, Australia, and an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe. The results show that MGSurvE can effectively optimize trap placement to minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest. For example, in the case of the Aedes aegypti population in Queensland, MGSurvE identified the most effective locations for traps to detect a specific allele, allowing for early detection and potential remediation.

MGSurvE is a valuable tool for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance. The framework can be used to distribute traps efficiently and minimize the time to detection of an allele of interest, which is critical for the success of gene drive projects and the control of mosquito-borne diseases.
Scientists have re-examined the tiny eukaryote Symbiomonas scintillans, which was previously thought to have an endosymbiotic bacterium living inside its cells. However, a new study has found that instead of bacteria, S. scintillans is associated with giant viruses. The researchers used advanced sequencing techniques to analyze two strains of S. scintillans and found no evidence of endosymbiotic bacteria. They also used a technique called fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm the absence of bacteria in the cells. Instead, the sequencing data revealed a large number of sequences related to prasinoviruses, which are viruses that infect green algae. The researchers were able to assemble a near-complete genome of one of these viruses, which they called SsV, and found that it was closely related to other prasinoviruses that infect different types of algae. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed a virus-like particle in the cells of S. scintillans that was similar in size and shape to the endosymbiont previously reported. The study suggests that S. scintillans does not have an endosymbiotic bacterium, but is instead infected with giant viruses. This finding has implications for our understanding of the relationships between hosts and their symbionts, and highlights the complexity of the interactions between microorganisms in the ocean.
Research on the leiomodin (Lmod) family of proteins, which play a crucial role in muscle function, has revealed that mutations in these proteins can lead to human myopathies. Specifically, mutations in the cardiac-predominant isoform, LMOD2, have been linked to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense or frameshift mutations, which are predicted to result in the expression of truncated proteins. However, surprisingly, little to no LMOD protein is expressed in most cases of disease.

A study has now shown that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons, is responsible for the loss of mutant protein expression in two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. The researchers also developed steric-blocking oligonucleotides (SBOs) that can prevent NMD of mutant LMOD2 transcripts, thereby restoring mutant protein expression. This finding has significant implications for the treatment of LMOD-linked myopathies, as it suggests that SBOs could be used in combination with drugs that promote the translation of full-length protein to rescue cardiac function in patients with certain mutations in LMOD2. The study lays the groundwork for potential therapeutic interventions in LMOD-linked myopathies, which are characterized by muscle weakness and reduced muscle contractility.
Researchers studied how different versions of a protein called Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease. ApoE has three main versions: ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. Previous studies have shown that ApoE4 increases the risk of Alzheimer's, while ApoE2 may provide some protection. To understand how these versions of ApoE work, the researchers created mice with human versions of ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4. They looked at how these versions of ApoE affect the regulation of proteins in the brain and liver.

The study found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both affect the regulation of proteins in the brain, but in different ways. ApoE4 seems to disrupt the connection between the outer and inner parts of mitochondria, which can lead to problems with energy production. ApoE2, on the other hand, increases the breakdown and replacement of proteins in the mitochondria, which may help to keep the mitochondria healthy. The researchers did not see these changes in the liver, suggesting that the effects of ApoE on protein regulation are more pronounced in the brain.

The study also found that combining data on protein abundance and turnover rates can provide a more complete picture of how proteins are regulated in the cell. This approach can help researchers understand how different versions of ApoE affect the risk of Alzheimer's disease. The findings suggest that ApoE4 disrupts the normal functioning of mitochondria, while ApoE2 may help to maintain mitochondrial health. Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms by which ApoE affects the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
Researchers have developed a new tool called CRISPR-TRiM, which allows for tissue-specific gene knockout in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ). The NMJ is a crucial model for studying various biological processes, including axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and plasticity. However, previous attempts to apply CRISPR to the NMJ have been unsuccessful.

The new CRISPR-TRiM toolkit enables the knockout of genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells, which are essential components of the NMJ. The researchers validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and demonstrated its compatibility with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system. They also showed that CRISPR-TRiM can be used to knock out multiple redundant genes simultaneously.

Using CRISPR-TRiM, the researchers discovered that SNARE components play a crucial role in NMJ maintenance. They also found that the ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Furthermore, they discovered that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ.

The CRISPR-TRiM tool has been successfully applied to the NMJ, revealing genes important for NMJ structural plasticity. This breakthrough has significant implications for understanding the complex biology of the NMJ and may lead to new insights into human neurological disorders.
In Drosophila, the development of blood cells, or hematopoiesis, relies on a stockpile of progenitor cells in the blood-forming organ called the lymph gland. During larval stages, these progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which primes them for differentiation into mature blood cells. However, not all progenitors differentiate at the same time. Researchers found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish plays a crucial role in regulating this process. Relish shields the progenitor pool from a metabolic pathway that triggers differentiation by inhibiting the activation of JNK, a protein that upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FAO). This inhibition ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not depleted too quickly. The researchers discovered that Relish also regulates the developmental signal TAK1, which monitors the input from ROS and prevents premature differentiation. By integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways, Relish ensures that the progenitors differentiate at the right time. This study sheds light on how cell fate transition is regulated during development. The researchers found that overexpressing Rel in progenitor cells can lead to the downregulation of FAO, and that genetic loss of Relish from the progenitors leads to the activation of the JNK-FAO cascade, causing them to differentiate prematurely.
Researchers have identified a new genetic variant associated with Taybi-Linder syndrome (TALS), a rare disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. The variant, RTTN c.2953A>G, was found in a patient with TALS-like symptoms, but not in the RNU4ATAC gene, which is typically associated with the disorder. Whole-exome sequencing revealed that the patient was homozygous for the RTTN variant, which alters the splicing donor site sequence of intron 23.

Studies using patient fibroblasts, engineered cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs) or cortical organoids (COs) showed that the RTTN variant leads to major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities. NSCs accumulated in the G2-M phase, resulting in aneuploidy, cell cycle arrest, and cell death. The mitotic defects were associated with slight misorientation of the mitotic spindles, which may favor premature differentiation of NSCs into neurons.

In cortical organoids, the RTTN variant was found to disrupt the self-organization of NSCs into neural rosettes, leading to delayed apico-basal polarization of NSCs. This resulted in a marked delay of rosette formation, impeding the overall growth of the organoids. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c.2953A>G variant and sheds light on the mechanisms leading to microcephaly in TALS.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Escherichia coli adapts to survive in a state of prolonged resource exhaustion, known as long-term stationary phase (LTSP). They conducted an experiment where E. coli populations were allowed to grow on rich media and then left without new resources for up to six years. By analyzing the genetic changes in hundreds of clones sampled over time, the researchers found that E. coli continuously adapts genetically through the accumulation of mutations. This adaptation occurs in a highly convergent manner, meaning that similar mutations arise independently in different populations. The researchers also discovered that long-lasting lineages are established during LTSP, with similar lineages emerging across populations. These lineages are characterized by the acquisition of specific mutations, particularly in the RNA polymerase core (RNAPC) region. The study found that a third of the convergently mutated loci are involved in associations with other mutations, suggesting historical contingency. This means that the order in which mutations occur can influence the outcome of the adaptation process. The results demonstrate that E. coli adaptation under LTSP is characterized by high parallelism and frequent historical contingency. The study's findings provide new insights into the dynamics of adaptation in bacteria and have implications for our understanding of evolutionary processes.
Researchers have made a surprising discovery about a type of RNA molecule in fruit flies called the male-specific abdominal (MSA) RNA. Initially thought to be non-coding, MSA was found to code for a small protein that plays a crucial role in how mated females use stored sperm. This protein, called MSAmiP, is produced in the male accessory glands and is essential for fertility.

The MSA transcript is closely related to another RNA molecule called the iab-8 long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), which is expressed in the posterior central nervous system of both males and females. However, unlike MSA, the iab-8 lncRNA does not produce a protein. Researchers investigated why this is the case and found that a mechanism prevents protein production from the iab-8 transcript. This mechanism relies on two unique exons at the beginning of the iab-8 lncRNA that contain upstream open reading frames (uORFs). These uORFs prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames.

Using cell culture and transgenic analysis, researchers confirmed that the presence of these uORFs is responsible for the lack of protein production from the iab-8 transcript. This discovery sheds new light on the complex regulation of gene expression in fruit flies and has implications for our understanding of fertility and reproductive biology.
Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare, multisystemic disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays. Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI anchor synthesis, lead to CDG. Despite their similar symptoms, CDG display large clinical variability, suggesting that modifier genes may influence the phenotypes. Researchers used evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) to identify common modifiers between CDG and glycosylation genes. ERC analysis revealed strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with ncRNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes. The study found that ERC analysis of disease genes and biological pathways allows for rapid prioritization of potential genetic modifiers, which can provide a better understanding of disease pathophysiology and novel therapeutic targets. The research also suggests that high ERC between N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis may indicate unexplored connections between these pathways, which may need to be studied together instead of in isolation.
Researchers have discovered a crucial step in the life cycle of the hepatitis B virus (HBV). They found that a protein called HBV polymerase (Pol) plays a dual role in packaging the virus's genetic material, known as pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). Initially, Pol brings the pgRNA to a protein called HBV core (HBc), which is essential for capsid assembly. However, to complete the packaging process, Pol recruits a host enzyme called protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) to dephosphorylate HBc. This dephosphorylation event is necessary for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and is associated with late endosomes and multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in the cell.

The researchers used a specific antibody to track the phosphorylation state of HBc and found that it undergoes a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging. They also identified a specific amino acid in Pol, Val782, which is necessary for the recruitment of PP1. The study suggests that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in recruiting PP1, which dephosphorylates HBc, allowing for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation.

This discovery provides new insights into the mechanism of HBV replication and may lead to the development of new antiviral therapies targeting PP1. The study highlights the complex interplay between HBV proteins and host enzymes in the packaging of viral genetic material, shedding light on the intricate process of viral replication.
A recent study investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific (TEP) and Caribbean, allowing for a "natural experiment" to study how closely related animals evolve and adapt. Researchers sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena, collected on either side of the Isthmus. The study found that the lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts, with those from the Caribbean having the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the TEP did not. This ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Further analysis revealed that the last common ancestor of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. The study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade. The findings highlight the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.
Researchers have identified 9,291 bitter taste receptors, known as TAS2Rs, from 661 vertebrate genomes. The study found that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high number of TAS2R genes compared to other vertebrates. In most species, these genes are found in clusters, but amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. The researchers also discovered that the number of TAS2R genes is proportional to the number of receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues, such as the skin and lungs, rather than just the tongue. This suggests that the expansion of TAS2R genes in amphibians may have allowed for the acquisition of new functions in these tissues.

In vitro receptor activity assays revealed that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics, or foreign substances. This is the first time that extra-oral TAS2R expression has been studied in amphibians. The study's findings provide new insights into the evolution and function of TAS2Rs in vertebrates and highlight the importance of these receptors in detecting and responding to environmental toxins. The research also suggests that the TAS2R gene family has undergone rapid expansion in frogs and salamanders, leading to a wider repertoire of these genes than in any other vertebrate lineage examined to date.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in the regulation of transcription and its impact on intestinal stem cells. They found that a tri-protein complex containing Notch intracellular domain (NICD), RBPj, and MAML1 binds to DNA as a monomer or dimer to regulate transcription. However, mice with Notch dimerization-deficient alleles (NDD) develop and age normally, but are more sensitive to environmental insults. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene misregulation, but did show an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts, which may contribute to the heightened sensitivity in NDD mice.

Further analysis using TurboID and mass-spectrometry revealed an unbalanced interactome in human colon carcinoma cells expressing a Notch dimerization-deficient allele, with reduced interaction with the transcription machinery but preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome. The researchers found that the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid (VPA) could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitor treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting a synergy between HDAC activity and the pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells. These findings suggest that Notch dimerization in mammals is not primarily about transcriptional regulation, but rather about the overall proteome environment and its indirect consequences on innate immunity and barrier functions.
Researchers have extended the theory of background selection, a process by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites, to account for the effects of migration in structured populations. Background selection can be divided into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are low, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are high. Previous studies have only quantified the effects of background selection on total neutral diversity (πT) and genetic differentiation (FST) for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime.

The researchers derived novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extended previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model. Using simulations, they showed that this theory best predicts FST and πT. The study found that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, as migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size.

The researchers also showed that background selection may weakly confound locus-to-locus FST scans when gene flow is sufficiently common. Their simulations suggest that this is true in an island model when migration rates are comparable to or stronger than the strength of selection against deleterious alleles. The study provides a novel theoretical derivation of the effects of background selection in an island model, accounting for the effects of migration and presenting a first step into the application of background selection theory in systems with more complex demography.
Biomedical researchers rely on large amounts of genetic and phenotypic data to understand the genetic determinants of diseases. However, sharing this data among institutions is often restricted due to privacy concerns and regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This limits the ability to conduct high-powered collaborative studies. To address this issue, a new tool called FedGMMAT has been developed. FedGMMAT is a federated genetic association testing tool that uses a federated statistical testing approach to correct for confounding factors while protecting sensitive data. The tool utilizes homomorphic encryption and a symmetric One-Time Pad (OTP)-like encryption mechanism to protect intermediate statistics, ensuring that genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites.

FedGMMAT is designed to be flexible and can integrate multiple subject-level random effects, making it suitable for various study designs. The tool uses an efficient and flexible two-step score testing approach, which allows it to correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects. In simulations and real-world datasets, FedGMMAT achieved results comparable to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. This suggests that FedGMMAT is a viable solution for conducting high-powered collaborative studies while protecting sensitive data. The development of FedGMMAT addresses a significant methodological barrier in genetic research and has the potential to facilitate the sharing of genetic data among institutions, ultimately advancing our understanding of the genetic determinants of diseases.
Researchers have been working to improve the accuracy of polygenic risk scores (PRS), which are used to predict the likelihood of developing certain diseases, including prostate cancer. These scores take into account multiple genetic variants and have shown promise in predicting disease risk. However, their effectiveness in diverse populations, such as African and Asian populations, has been limited. A recent study aimed to assess the performance of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, in predicting prostate cancer risk. The researchers used data from the UK Biobank and the All of Us cohort to benchmark the algorithms. They found that the algorithms showed modest improvement in predictive power compared to a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. The study also found that hierarchical clustering was effective in stratifying polygenic scores by ancestry. The researchers suggest that PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening may help reduce overdiagnosis and over-treatment associated with PSA screening alone. However, they emphasize the need for risk scores to work equally well across populations to limit disparities. The study demonstrates the utility of scores generated from the UK Biobank dataset and shows that genetic risk combined with participant age is sufficient to predict prostate cancer. The findings highlight the importance of improving risk prediction algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts to ensure equitable use of PRS in clinical practice.
Researchers have identified potential new treatments for a rare genetic disorder called DPAGT1-CDG, which affects the development of the eyes and other parts of the body. The disorder is caused by a mutation in the DPAGT1 gene, which plays a crucial role in a process called N-linked glycosylation. To find new treatments, scientists used a fruit fly model of the disorder, which has a small, improperly developed eye. They tested 1,520 small molecules that are already approved for use in humans and found 42 that improved the eye development in the fly model. Further analysis revealed that some of these molecules work by targeting the dopamine system in the brain. Specifically, they found that blocking the dopamine D2 receptor or reducing the production of dopamine improved the eye development in the fly model. This suggests that excessive dopamine signaling may contribute to the symptoms of DPAGT1-CDG. The researchers also identified other potential treatments, including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These findings provide new insights into the biology of DPAGT1-CDG and offer potential new therapeutic options for the disorder. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of using a fruit fly model to identify new treatments for a rare genetic disorder, and highlights the potential of drug repurposing as a strategy for finding new therapies.
Researchers have developed a new computational model called the topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to better understand how the brain processes proprioception, the sense of body position and movement. Proprioception is essential for controlling movement, but the way it is represented in the brain is not well understood. The topo-VAE model uses a large dataset of natural movement data to create a map of the brain's somatosensory cortex, which is responsible for processing sensory information from the body.

The model was able to reproduce two key features of proprioception in monkeys: the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and the distribution of neuronal preferred directions recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model also made several testable predictions, including that encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of preferred directions, and that few neurons will encode just a single joint.

The topo-VAE model provides a principled basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, which could have applications in the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots. The model's ability to generalize to other regions of the sensory cortex and its minimal inductive bias regarding a particular sensory modality make it a promising tool for understanding the computational principles that drive the mapping of proprioceptive arm representations onto the cortex.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene in plant growth and development, as well as its response to stress. However, the role of ethylene in microbes has been understudied. A recent study focused on Azospirillum brasilense, a bacterium that associates with plant roots, and found that it contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 (AzoEtr1). This receptor directly binds ethylene with high affinity, and treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. The study also found that ethylene causes widespread metabolic changes in the bacterium, affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and leading to the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. These findings suggest that ethylene from host plants can alter the density of colonization by A. brasilense and rewire its metabolism, prompting the bacterium to implement an adaptation program. This research provides new insights into the role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions and identifies potential targets for regulating beneficial interactions between plants and microbes.
Researchers investigated the role of the INO80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. INO80 is a key component of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which plays a crucial role in DNA repair and transcription regulation. The study found that INO80 localizes to the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting a role in the meiotic sex body. Deletion of INO80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes, indicating that INO80 is necessary for silencing these genes. The study also found that the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of INO80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition (MSCI) was reduced in the absence of INO80, suggesting that INO80 facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes. This role of INO80 is independent of the histone variant H2A.Z. Instead, INO80 regulates chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites on the sex chromosomes, facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema. The study proposes that INO80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC1, facilitating MDC1 recruitment at the sex chromosomes and amplifying γH2A.X in chromatin loops in an INO80-facilitated ATR-dependent fashion.
Researchers have identified a key player in the process of axon regeneration in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. The protein SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family, plays a dual role in promoting axon regeneration and regulating early development. However, it is unclear how SVH-1 can switch from a protease to a growth factor to facilitate axon regeneration. To address this question, scientists investigated the role of cytidine deaminase (CDD) SVH-17/CDD-2 in the functional conversion of SVH-1. They found that CDD-2 is essential for axon regeneration and that it promotes the transformation of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor. The researchers discovered that a specific codon exchange in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the CDD-2 defect in axon regeneration. Additionally, they found that a stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These findings suggest that CDD-2 plays a crucial role in promoting axon regeneration by modifying the function of SVH-1. The study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration and may have implications for the development of treatments for nerve injuries and diseases.
Researchers have used zebrafish to study their collective behavior, which can be influenced by factors such as aging, disease, and genetics. This behavior can be modeled using active matter models, where individual fish are represented as self-propelling agents interacting with each other and their environment. In most cases, the collective behavior of zebrafish cannot be controlled at the individual level. However, a new study demonstrates that genetic modification can be used to control the collective behavior of zebrafish by changing the characteristics of the individual fish. The researchers genetically modified zebrafish to lack the col11a2 gene, which causes early onset of osteoarthritis. The mutant fish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent their bodies less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish showed more orderly collective motion than wild-type fish. The researchers used a simple active matter model to capture the collective behavior of both wild-type and mutant fish, with the mutant fish modeled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This study demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model. The findings suggest that genetic modification can be used to control the collective behavior of zebrafish, providing a new tool for studying the relationship between genetic traits and physiological changes in the body.
Researchers have developed a new model to simulate the growth of capillary networks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Capillary networks are crucial for delivering oxygen and nutrients to tissues, and understanding how they form is essential for creating artificial tissues and organs. The new model combines mechanical and chemical signals to predict how endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, migrate and change shape to form capillary networks. The model shows that both mechanical forces and chemical signals from a protein called VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) are necessary for capillary network development. VEGF comes in two forms: a soluble form in the culture medium and a bound form attached to the surface of a biogel scaffold. The model predicts that the soluble form of VEGF induces changes in cell shape, while the bound form provides directional signals that guide cell movement. The results of the model agree with experimental data, showing that capillary networks can form when both mechanical and chemical signals are present. However, the model still has limitations, such as omitting the role of bound VEGF in mechanical mechanisms and failing to fully reproduce results from experiments with tilted biogel surfaces. The new model provides a more comprehensive understanding of capillary network development and can be used to improve tissue engineering and regenerative medicine techniques.
Researchers studied the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) family of proteins in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. This family of proteins plays a crucial role in various biological processes, including wound repair, immunity, and tissue development. The study found that all five TGF-β ligands in C. elegans, including DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3, contribute to the worm's ability to survive bacterial infections. The researchers discovered that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs work together in a non-redundant manner to mount an immune response. Specifically, the two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, function independently of each other, while TIG-2 and TIG-3, a TGF-β/Activin-like ligand, work together. Structural modeling suggests that TIG-2 and TIG-3 can form heterodimers. The study also found that TIG-2 and TIG-3 lack a conserved cysteine residue responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers, a rare characteristic among TGF-β ligands. Furthermore, the researchers showed that the canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers are involved in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role. These findings highlight the potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and provide a mechanism for distinguishing their developmental and homeostatic functions from an acute response like the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.
Researchers have identified a new player in the DNA damage response (DDR) process, which protects the genome from damage. The study focused on the enzyme N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 (Nat4), which modifies histones, proteins that DNA wraps around. In yeast cells, Nat4 was found to be essential for responding to DNA damage. Cells lacking Nat4 were more sensitive to DNA damage and accumulated more DNA breaks than normal cells. When DNA damage occurred, Nat4 expression increased, and the enzyme was recruited to the damaged area. The study found that Nat4's role in DDR is mediated by its ability to acetylate histone H4, a specific type of histone. This modification is crucial for the proper functioning of the DNA damage checkpoint, a process that helps cells repair or respond to DNA damage. Without Nat4, the checkpoint was impaired, leading to reduced activation of the DNA damage response. The study suggests that Nat4's acetyltransferase activity on histone H4 is essential for maintaining genome integrity. This discovery expands our understanding of the DDR process and highlights the importance of histone modifications in protecting the genome from damage. The findings have implications for understanding how cells respond to DNA damage and may lead to new insights into cancer and other diseases related to genome instability.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells, known as cancer phylogenies. These phylogenies provide valuable insights into cancer development and can guide treatment strategies. Existing methods for reconstructing cancer phylogenies using bulk DNA sequencing data become inaccurate when dealing with more than 30 mutations, or fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Orchard is a fast and accurate algorithm that can reconstruct phylogenies using up to 1000 mutations. It works by sampling without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, and optimizes each factor sequentially to generate a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies. Evaluations of Orchard demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs). Orchard's large and accurate phylogenies are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations. The algorithm can reliably reconstruct trees with up to 1000 mutations and 100 samples, and can recover larger trees on simulated data. The results of Orchard's reconstructions match or beat ground-truth baselines on tree reconstruction problems with up to 300 mutations and up to 100 samples from the same cancer.
Researchers have developed a new tool called ImmugenX to predict how well the immune system will react to cancer cells. This is a crucial step in creating personalized cancer treatments that target specific cells. ImmugenX uses a modular language model to analyze the interaction between cancer cells and the immune system. The model is made up of several parts, including a module that predicts how well a protein from a cancer cell will bind to a part of the immune system called a major histocompatibility complex (MHC). This module was trained on several tasks related to MHC prediction and performed as well as or better than existing models. When the model was tested on its ability to predict how well the immune system will react to cancer cells, it outperformed all other models, with a 7% increase in accuracy compared to the next best model. The model's performance improved even more when it was given additional information about the immune system's T-cells. The researchers also analyzed the model's performance to identify areas where it could be improved and potential biases in the data used to train it. ImmugenX has the potential to be a valuable tool in the development of personalized cancer treatments, allowing for more targeted and effective therapies.
Researchers have identified a gene called protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma (PPP1CC) as the primary cause of meat lightness and redness in chickens. This discovery was made through a genome-wide association study and gene-based association analysis of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens. The study found that a specific variant of the PPP1CC gene, rs315520807, located in the intron of the gene, regulates the gene's transcription activity and affects meat color.

The researchers used a mouse model to validate the causal relationship between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness and redness. They found that mice with a knockout of the PPP1CC gene had increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in their limb muscles, and a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Further analysis revealed that the inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes, and enhanced the glycolysis pathway.

The study also found that the PPP1CC gene is involved in muscle glycogen metabolism and functions by binding with protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3A (PPP1R3A). The researchers suggest that understanding the genetic basis of meat color is important for the innovation of modern meat improvement technology, and that this discovery can aid in the development of new strategies for improving meat quality.
Researchers have developed a new technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the functional architecture of the retina. This technique combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits in retinal ganglion cells. By using STR, scientists can identify subunits across a wide range of model variations and potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within a few tens of minutes of recording time. This makes it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings.

The technique works by using a center-surround structure of Ricker stripes to sharpen subunit responses and super-resolve them below the scale of the subunits themselves. The presentation of stripes at varying positions and angles allows for a tomographic reconstruction of subunits. The researchers tested STR using a simplified ganglion cell model and then applied it to electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells. The results showed that STR can reliably identify subunits and has the potential to reduce the required recording time.

By knowing the subunit locations, scientists can manufacture targeted stimuli to characterize the spatiotemporal integration properties, nonlinearities, and functional synaptic weight of each subunit, and evaluate their similarity across multiple subunits within one ganglion cell receptive field. This new technique has the potential to provide a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina and could lead to a better understanding of how the retina processes visual information.
Researchers have developed a new statistical method called CRISPRi-DR to identify genes that interact with antibiotics in bacteria. This method uses CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) technology to study chemical-genetic interactions (CGIs). CRISPRi is a tool that allows scientists to temporarily turn off specific genes in a cell to see how it affects the cell's behavior. By using CRISPRi, researchers can identify genes that interact with antibiotics and understand how they work.

The new method, CRISPRi-DR, takes into account the strength of the CRISPRi tool used to turn off the gene and the concentration of the antibiotic. This is important because the strength of the CRISPRi tool and the concentration of the antibiotic can affect the outcome of the experiment. The method uses a mathematical model to analyze the data and identify genes that interact with antibiotics.

The researchers tested the CRISPRi-DR method on data from an experiment with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis. They also tested it on data from an experiment with E. coli, a type of bacteria that is commonly used in scientific research. The results showed that the CRISPRi-DR method was able to identify genes that interact with antibiotics more accurately than other methods.

The CRISPRi-DR method has the potential to be used to identify new targets for antibiotics and to understand how bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics. This could lead to the development of new treatments for bacterial infections.
Researchers used a new method called the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model (SBM) to analyze gene co-expression networks in Drosophila melanogaster. Unlike traditional methods, the SBM does not assume that genes are organized into assortative modules, or groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. Instead, the SBM separates genes into hierarchically organized blocks based on all available information in the co-expression network. The study found that the SBM identified ten times as many groups as traditional methods, and that several of these groups were not modular. The researchers also found that the functional relevance of non-modular groups was as strong as that of modular communities. This suggests that the transcriptome is more complex than previously thought, and that modularity may not be the main driver of gene co-expression network structure. The study highlights the need to incorporate other sources of information beyond assortativity when exploring biological networks. The researchers used a more general measure of similarity to identify meaningful gene groups that are not necessarily assortative but still have clear biological interpretation. The study used RNAseq gene expression data from two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster. The results show that non-modular blocks are widespread in gene co-expression networks, and that their functional relevance is as strong as that of modular blocks. This challenges the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks.
Researchers studied the role of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC), also known as Pab1 in yeast, in post-transcriptional control. PABPC is involved in translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. To understand its direct and indirect roles, the researchers used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and Ribo-Seq to analyze yeast cells lacking the PAB1 gene. They found that these cells had drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. The defects were partly due to reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex, in addition to the general loss of Pab1's direct role in these processes. The cells also showed a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype, indicating a defect in translation termination. The study suggests that eliminating PABPC has a profound impact on post-transcriptional regulation, unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins. The researchers used high-throughput approaches to explore the transcriptome-wide effects of PABPC depletion in yeast, similar to previous studies in mammalian cells. They found that PAB1 deletion resulted in major changes in the transcriptome, but minimal changes in relative translation efficiency. The study also explored the phenotypes of mRNA decay, translation initiation, translation efficiency, and translation termination upon PAB1 deletion, focusing on analyses of pab1Δpbp1Δ cells relative to pbp1Δ cells. The results provided insights into the direct vs. indirect consequences of PAB1 deletion and suggested a new layer of complexity in interpreting genome-wide gene expression alterations in PABPC-depleted cells.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that can generate slow brain rhythms, such as those seen during sleep or seizures, in neurons. This mechanism involves the interaction between the sodium-potassium pump, which regulates the concentration of potassium ions outside the cell, and the electrical activity of the neuron. The study found that when the sodium-potassium pump is active, it can create a feedback loop that influences the neuron's electrical activity, leading to slow oscillations.

The researchers used mathematical modeling to explore this mechanism and found that it can produce three different types of dynamics: slow bursting, tonic spiking, and depolarization block. The type of dynamics that occurs depends on the strength of the sodium-potassium pump. The study suggests that disturbances in the regulation of extracellular potassium, such as those caused by glial malfunction or hypoxia, can lead to transitions between these different dynamics.

This new mechanism is thought to be a common feature of class I excitable neurons, which are found in many parts of the brain. The study's findings could contribute to a better understanding of neurological disorders such as epilepsy and inform the development of new therapeutic strategies. The researchers also suggest that this mechanism could be a key factor in the generation of slow oscillations in other types of cells, not just neurons.
Researchers have developed a new R-package called COPS to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-view clustering algorithms in identifying subtypes of complex diseases, such as cancer. These algorithms combine data from different sources, like genetic and molecular information, to group patients with similar characteristics. However, previous studies have overlooked the importance of evaluating the stability and prognostic relevance of these clusters. COPS addresses this gap by providing advanced methods to assess clustering results, including similarity networks, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. The researchers applied COPS to multi-omics data from seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer, and compared data-driven and pathway-driven clustering methods. They found that some methods, such as Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels, were the most stable and effective in identifying groups with different survival outcomes. The study also emphasized the importance of using multiple criteria, including cluster stability and prognostic relevance, to evaluate multi-view clustering methods. Additionally, the researchers introduced two new pathway graph kernels, BWK and RWR-BWK, which may be better suited for clustering analysis. The findings of this study provide insights into the potential of multi-omics clustering analysis for cancer subtyping and may have implications for improving patient stratification and personalized treatment.
Researchers have studied the role of the SoxC protein SEM-2 in the development of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and for specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. A new study has identified a partial loss-of-function allele of sem-2 that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the DNA-binding domain. This mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage, including its antagonistic relationship with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, in regulating dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. SEM-2 also regulates the expression of hlh-8, a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor, which plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. The study found that SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage, and that it directly regulates the expression of hlh-8. This research adds to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins and identifies new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development. The findings suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins, and highlight the importance of SEM-2 in the development of the M lineage. The study provides new insights into the relationships between various factors important in M lineage development and the sole SoxC transcription factor SEM-2.
