Summary
     Biologists have long known that nervous systems use two main ways to communicate between cells: chemical synapses and electrical synapses. Chemical synapses involve the release of neurotransmitters, while electrical synapses allow direct communication between cells through gap junctions, which are clusters of intercellular channels. However, it was unclear whether electrical synapses require additional cellular structures to function.

     To investigate this question, researchers studied the Mauthner cells in zebrafish, which have identifiable single synaptic contacts where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Using a technique called expansion microscopy, the researchers created a detailed map of the proteins present at these synaptic contacts. They found that most of the synaptic contact's surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures.

     The researchers also found that glutamate receptors, which are involved in chemical synapses, were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. This suggests that electrical synapses operate with multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses, which are found throughout animal connectomes. The relationship between gap junctions and adherens junctions will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses and may have implications for our understanding of how neurons communicate with each other. The study's results also suggest that electrical synapses may be more complex than previously thought, with multiple gap junctions working together to facilitate communication between cells.

     The researchers used expansion microscopy to examine the synaptic contacts in larval zebrafish, which share comparable morphological and functional properties with those of adult fish. This technique allowed them to create a detailed map of the proteins present at the synaptic contacts, revealing a complex arrangement of gap junctions, adherens junctions, and glutamate receptors. The study's findings provide a new understanding of the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses and may have implications for our understanding of how neurons communicate with each other.
Summary
     The pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC) is a group of neurons in the brain that plays a crucial role in generating the breathing rhythm. Researchers have long been interested in understanding how the preBötC interacts with other parts of the brain to control breathing and other bodily functions. A recent study used a technique called optogenetics to selectively turn off specific neurons in the preBötC that project to the facial nucleus (7n), a group of neurons that controls facial and nasal movements.

     The study found that when these preBötC neurons were turned off, the activity of the mystacial pad, a region of the face, was affected, but breathing was not significantly impacted. However, the effect of turning off these neurons varied depending on the type of anesthetic used and whether the animal was conscious or anesthetized. The researchers also found that the preBötC neurons that project to the 7n are a mix of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that send signals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in regulating autonomic activity.

     The study suggests that modulating specific subgroups of preBötC neurons based on their axonal projections could be a useful strategy for understanding how breathing is coordinated with other motor and physiological behaviors. This is important because abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors has been linked to the development and progression of certain diseases. The researchers propose that the preBötC neurons projecting to the 7n are likely transmitting the respiratory rhythm rather than generating it, and that selective photoinhibition of these neurons should modulate orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory motor activity.

     To test this hypothesis, the researchers used a combination of viral transgenic approaches to selectively turn off preBötC neurons that project to the 7n. They found that this selective photoinhibition affected the activity of the mystacial pad while having a minimal impact on breathing. However, the effect of selective photoinhibition on breathing was still present, particularly under certain types of anesthesia and during recovery phases. The study highlights the complex interactions between the preBötC and other brain regions and suggests that further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying breathing and orofacial behaviors.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long known that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) play a crucial role in processing aversive information and signaling a general alarm to the forebrain. However, most studies have focused on their involvement in passive defensive behaviors, such as freezing responses. A recent study aimed to investigate the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behaviors, specifically fleeing responses, using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice.

     The researchers found that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. When CGRP neurons were optogenetically activated during robot chasing, mice exhibited elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests. This suggests that CGRP activation amplifies the perceived threat, promoting active defensive behaviors. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons showed reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening.

     The study used a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels to record neuronal activity. The results confirmed that stimulating CGRP neurons without external aversive stimuli generates rapid, unconditioned freezing behavior in mice. The researchers then tested whether manipulating the activity of CGRP neurons during fear conditioning with robot chasing promotes fleeing behavior or amplifies freezing behavior. They found that optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons in the absence of external stimuli induced robust freezing, and their activation during conventional fear conditioning further amplified conditioned freezing.

     However, under heightened threat conditions, such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds, these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat. The study suggests that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat. The findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.

Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in metastasis, the process by which cancer spreads from its original site to other parts of the body. CSCs undergo a process called epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which allows them to acquire a more invasive and migratory phenotype. However, the relevance of EMT CSCs to human cancer has been uncertain, as they have not been directly observed in human tumour specimens.

    To address this knowledge gap, a team of researchers used a combination of immunofluorescent staining and machine learning to identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens. They stained over 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours for three markers: EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin. EpCAM is a tumour lineage and EMT CSC marker, CD24 is a plastic EMT CSC marker, and Vimentin is a mesenchymal marker that distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumour cells.

    The researchers found a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24, and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. Using an artificial neural network (ANN), they were able to predict metastasis with high accuracy, with a cross-validated accuracy of 87-89%. This suggests that the presence of EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is a strong predictor of metastasis.

    Importantly, the researchers were able to observe single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, which were highly predictive of metastatic disease. This is a significant finding, as it provides direct evidence for the role of EMT CSCs in human cancer. The study also highlights the potential of machine learning approaches to predict metastasis based on the presence of EMT CSCs.

    The researchers used an image-based machine learning approach to automate the analysis of thousands of fields of view from human tumours, enabling them to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue. This allowed them to identify single disseminating EMT CSCs and use these to train the ANN to predict metastasis. The study provides new insights into the role of EMT CSCs in human cancer and highlights the potential of machine learning approaches to predict metastasis.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long known that the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, plays a crucial role in tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which apoptotic cells are recognized and cleared from the body are not fully understood. A recent study used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. The researchers found that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors, which help clear apoptotic cells, are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident macrophages, during inflammation.

     The study also found that human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. In mouse wounds, the researchers detected upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in mice revealed that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreased efferocytosis and abrogated wound repair.

     The study provides an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. The researchers found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds, the data show that efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair.

     The study also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds. The researchers hypothesized that efficient efferocytosis clears apoptotic cells during inflammation, given the upregulation of mRNAs associated with apoptosis and the relatively low level of apoptotic cells in early wound beds. The study highlights the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provides potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
Summary
     Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have greatly improved our understanding of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data remains a challenge. To address this issue, researchers have developed a genetic barcoding approach called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing (TaG-EM). This method involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct. The barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, allowing for the positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects.

     The TaG-EM method takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila, enabling the deterministic in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. By creating many independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables the identification of multiplet droplets, barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Additionally, the genetic barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements.

     The researchers demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded fly lines using next-generation sequencing. This approach provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing. Moreover, the genetic barcodes can be used to multiplex behavioral or other phenotypic measurements, making TaG-EM a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms.

     However, the researchers note that TaG-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single-cell gene expression data. The strength of the Gal4 driver may contribute to the labeling density, and variable recovery of TaG-EM barcodes has been observed even with the same pan-midgut Gal4 driver. Despite this limitation, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens and improve the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how certain animals, like poison frogs, develop complex defense mechanisms to protect themselves from predators. Poison frogs in the Dendrobatidae family have evolved the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for defense, but previous research has focused mainly on colorful species, leaving out inconspicuous ones that are thought to be undefended. A new study has found that these understudied frogs also contain measurable amounts of alkaloids, contradicting the idea that diet is the primary source of their defense.

     The researchers discovered that these frogs consume mites and ants, which are known to contain alkaloids. However, the amounts of alkaloids in the frogs are low, suggesting that diet alone cannot explain their defense mechanism. Instead, the study proposes a new concept called "passive accumulation," where the frogs absorb toxins from their diet without any specialized transport or storage mechanisms.

     Passive accumulation is thought to be an ancestral state in the Dendrobatidae family and possibly in related species. The study suggests that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense. The researchers also propose an evolutionary model that incorporates ideas from pharmacokinetics to explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in poison frogs and other animals.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of chemical defenses in animals. It suggests that passive accumulation may be a more common phenomenon than previously thought, and that it could be an intermediate stage in the evolution of toxin sequestration. The study also highlights the need for further research on the relationship between natural toxin exposure and toxin resistance in poison frogs.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex defense mechanisms of poison frogs and sheds light on the evolution of chemical defenses in animals. The findings have the potential to inform our understanding of the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins and the origins of acquired chemical defenses.

     Biomedical researchers have long struggled to develop effective treatments for advanced breast cancer due to the complex process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT allows cancer cells to become more aggressive and resistant to chemotherapy. To better understand this process, a team of scientists used a unique mouse model and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. They found that ribosome biogenesis (RiBi), the process by which cells produce new proteins, is elevated during the transitioning phases of both EMT and its reverse process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET).

The researchers discovered that the RiBi pathway is essential for the completion of EMT and MET, and that inhibiting it impairs the ability of tumor cells to undergo these transitions. They also found that combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduces the growth of metastatic tumor cells. This suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway may be a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.

The study used a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice, which allowed the researchers to track the EMT status of tumor cells over time. They found that the RiBi pathway is transiently elevated during the transitioning phases of EMT and MET, and that this elevation is necessary for the completion of these processes. The researchers also analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing data from human breast cancer patients and found that RiBi activity is associated with the EMT status of tumor cells.

The study's findings have important implications for the development of new cancer therapies. Targeting the RiBi pathway may help to overcome EMT-related chemoresistance and chemoresistant metastasis, which are major challenges in treating advanced breast cancer. The researchers suggest that combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs may be an effective way to reduce the growth of metastatic tumor cells. Overall, this study provides new insights into the complex process of EMT and highlights the potential of targeting the RiBi pathway as a therapeutic strategy for advanced breast cancer.

Summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand how the brain processes and encodes language in real-world contexts. A recent study aimed to investigate the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts during movie watching to determine the extent to which brain responses change depending on visual context. The study found that across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information. The study highlights the brain's ability to integrate information across sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations, a process critical for navigating the multimodal nature of real-world experiences. The findings also suggest that similar effects may be observed in contexts that engage other sensory modalities. The study's results have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and encodes language in real-world contexts, and how this processing changes depending on the availability of contextual information. The study's findings also suggest that the brain's response to language is not fixed, but rather dynamic and dependent on the context in which it is processed. The study's results have significant implications for fields such as linguistics, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience, and highlight the importance of considering the role of context in language processing. The study's findings also suggest that the brain's ability to integrate information across sensory modalities is critical for forming coherent conceptual representations, and that this ability is essential for navigating the complex and dynamic nature of real-world experiences.

     Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in cancer immunotherapy, but its application is limited by the lack of targetable antigens on tumor cells. To address this issue, scientists have been exploring ways to uncover hidden antigens on cancer cells. One way to do this is by inhibiting the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway, a cellular process that destroys RNA products from genes with truncating mutations, thereby concealing neoantigens. A team of researchers developed a high-throughput screen to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells and found that disrupting the kinase SMG1's phosphorylation of UPF1 is a potential disruptor of NMD. They designed a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, which elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Importantly, KVS0001 increases the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. This breakthrough provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which it plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. The researchers demonstrated that KVS0001 inhibits the NMD pathway at concentrations as low as 600 nM, leading to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts. Western blotting showed that KVS0001 decreases the amount of phosphorylated UPF1, the downstream target of SMG1 kinase activity, in three different cell lines. Additionally, treatment of cancer cell lines with KVS0001 resulted in specific increases in the transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations. The researchers also developed a cell-based high-throughput assay to query the effects of small molecules on NMD function and identified SMG1 as a critical mediator of NMD. They improved the biophysical properties of a previously reported SMG1-specific small molecule inhibitor, SMG1i-11, to develop KVS0001, which is a specific inhibitor of SMG1 that is soluble and can be easily administered to mice. Overall, the discovery of KVS0001 provides a new tool for studying NMD and has the potential to improve cancer immunotherapy by uncovering hidden antigens on cancer cells.
Summary
     A new measure of aging, called Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge), has been explored as a predictor of cancer risk in a study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biobank. PhenoAge is calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and PhenoAge Acceleration (PhenoAgeAccel) is the difference between PhenoAge and chronological age. The study found that PhenoAgeAccel was associated with an increased risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.22 in men and 1.26 in women compared to biologically younger participants. The study also found a joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2.29 for men and 1.94 for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared to those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge.

     The study also found that PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors, indicating that adherence to a healthy lifestyle may retard the aging process and reduce cancer risk. Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer, even after adjusting for chronological age. The study suggests that PhenoAgeAccel may be a cost-effective indicator for measuring biological age and a novel biomarker for cancer risk prediction.

     The study's findings are consistent with previous research that has investigated the associations between biological age and cancer risk. The study's results indicate that different measures of biological age may reflect different aspects of aging and could be used jointly in cancer risk assessment. The study's findings also support the idea that adherence to a healthy lifestyle may retard the aging process and reduce cancer risk. Overall, the study provides new insights into the relationship between aging and cancer risk and highlights the potential of PhenoAgeAccel as a biomarker for cancer risk prediction.
Biome, a mobile app launched in Japan, has collected over 6 million species observations since 2019. The app uses species identification algorithms and gamification elements to gather data from the public. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. To address this, researchers investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on species distribution models (SDMs).

The study found that species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but was below 90% for seed plants, molluscs, and fishes. The researchers then used SDMs to estimate the distribution of 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan. They found that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved the accuracy of SDMs. Specifically, for endangered species, traditional survey data required over 2000 records for accurate models, while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300.

The study suggests that the uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. The researchers conclude that establishing a platform for accumulating community-sourced distribution data will contribute to conserving and monitoring natural ecosystems.

The study highlights the potential of community-based survey platforms, such as Biome, to improve biodiversity assessment. The inclusion of Biome data resulted in improved accuracy of SDMs, with the most accurate model predictions obtained when the training data consisted of 50-70% Biome data. This suggests that incorporating both traditional surveys and citizen observations is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions. The study's findings have implications for biodiversity conservation and management, and demonstrate the value of community-sourced data in improving our understanding of species distributions.

     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the causes of congenital pulmonary cysts, a condition where abnormal lung development leads to cystic lesions in the airways. While previous studies have implicated disrupted airway epithelial cell growth in the formation of these cysts, the role of developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells has remained unclear. In a recent study, scientists used genetic mouse models to investigate the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1a (Bmpr1a)-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development.

     The researchers found that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. Additionally, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs.

     Notably, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts.

     The study provides solid in vivo evidence for the first time that Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchymal cells is indispensable in lung development. Lung mesenchymal deletion of Bmpr1a at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and then severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs.

     The researchers specifically deleted Bmpr1a in fetal lung mesenchymal cells, which resulted in abnormal airway development and subsequent prenatal cystic malformation. The inverse relationship between Bmpr1a deletion (intracellular BMP signaling) and Bmp4 ligand expression in these fetal lung mesenchymal progenitor cells was further confirmed by comparing Bmp4 expression in isolated fetal lung mesenchymal cells with different Bmpr1a genotypes. Alterations of other key pathways, including Fgf, Wnt, and Shh, were not detected by RNA-seq and RT-PCR through analyzing the related targeted genes.

     The pathological phenotype resembles the features observed in pediatric patients diagnosed with congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). Therefore, investigating the abnormal lung phenotypes caused by lung mesenchyme-specific Bmpr1a knockout and revealing the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms will significantly enhance our understanding of congenital lung diseases.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long known that anionic lipid molecules, such as phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), play a crucial role in regulating the activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, the dynamic relationship between PI(4,5)P2 and EGFR in living cells has remained unclear due to the difficulty of visualizing the local lipid domains around EGFR.

     To address this challenge, scientists used super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize both EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. They found that EGFR and PI(4,5)P2 nanodomains aggregate before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), and the degree of coaggregation decreases after EGF stimulation. This decrease in coaggregation depends on phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), an enzyme that hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2.

     The researchers also found that reducing the amount of PI(4,5)P2 in the plasma membrane decreases the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after EGF stimulation. Furthermore, inhibiting the hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 after EGF stimulation decreases the phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654, a key step in EGFR activation.

     These findings suggest that EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI(4,5)P2 around EGFR molecules are mutually regulated. In other words, the presence of PI(4,5)P2 stabilizes EGFR dimers, increasing EGFR autophosphorylation, while the subsequent hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 by PLCγ plays a crucial role in deactivating EGFR.

     The researchers propose that the preferential coaggregation of EGFR nanodomains with PI(4,5)P2 rather than phosphatidylserine (PS) is due to the curvature of the membrane. The study provides new insights into the dynamic relationship between PI(4,5)P2 and EGFR in living cells and highlights the importance of autogenous remodeling of the lipid environment in regulating EGFR activity.
Summary
     Stramenopiles are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that include multicellular algae, plant and fish pathogens, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. Unlike most eukaryotes, stramenopiles have a unique branched glycolysis pathway, where the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Researchers have identified a mitochondrial carrier protein in Blastocystis that transports glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. This carrier protein is unique to stramenopiles and has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers, which are required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. The glycolytic intermediate carrier identified in this study represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance. The discovery of this carrier protein provides new insights into the unique metabolic pathways of stramenopiles and highlights the potential for developing targeted therapies against these pathogens.
Summary
     A new framework for human genetic association studies has been proposed, which uses a deep learning model to calculate a functional genomic activity score for each haplotype in an individual. This score, called the Haplotype Function Score (HFS), replaces the original genotype in association studies. The HFS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank and identified 3619 independent HFS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, which is a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis.

     The HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait associations and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong biological interpretability. For example, the analysis found associations between the circadian pathway and chronotype, and between the arachidonic acid pathway and intelligence. Additionally, the HFS prediction score was integrated with SNP-based polygenic risk scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, which showed an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction.

     The study demonstrates that the HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods. The results suggest that incorporating HFS to represent genetically determined functional genomic activities in genetic association studies offers robust improvements in both the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits. The study concludes that HFS is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of human complex traits.

     The HFS framework was compared to other functionally aware fine-mapping methods, such as PolyFun and SbayesRC, and was found to detect more causal signals for each trait. The framework was applied to 14 polygenic traits in the UKB British ancestry training set, identifying 16,597 significant HFS-trait associations at a threshold of p < 5 × 10−8. The study suggests that HFS is a promising strategy for future genetic studies, but more progress in algorithm and computation and data resources are still desired.
Summary
     A recent study investigated the impact of three different types of mental training on the structure and function of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in stress regulation. The study involved 332 healthy adults who underwent three months of training in either attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, or socio-cognitive skills. The researchers used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine changes in hippocampal structure and function, as well as cortisol levels, a hormone associated with stress.

     The results showed that training in socio-affective skills, which involves cultivating compassion and care, led to an increase in the volume of a specific part of the hippocampus called the cornu ammonis (CA1-3). This increase in volume was accompanied by changes in the way different parts of the hippocampus communicate with each other, as well as a reduction in cortisol levels. In contrast, training in attention-based mindfulness and socio-cognitive skills did not have the same effects.

     The study also found that the changes in hippocampal structure and function were associated with reductions in cortisol levels, suggesting that the training may have helped to reduce stress. Notably, the study used a multivariate approach, which allowed the researchers to examine the contributions of different parts of the hippocampus to changes in cortisol levels.

     The findings of this study provide new insights into the relationship between mental training, hippocampal structure and function, and stress regulation. The results suggest that training in socio-affective skills may be particularly effective in promoting changes in the hippocampus that are associated with reduced stress. The study's findings have implications for the development of interventions aimed at reducing stress and promoting mental well-being.
Summary
     Biologists have long been interested in understanding how species adapt to their environments. One way species adapt is through the presence of genetic variations, or alleles, that give them an advantage in their local environment. However, it is unclear how much of an adaptive response can be attributed to large-effect alleles and inversions, which are regions of the genome that suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of these advantageous alleles.

     To explore this question, researchers conducted genome-wide association studies on three species of sunflowers: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris. These species have large regions of suppressed recombination, most of which are inversions, and are often associated with adaptive traits. The researchers found evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species.

     This suggests that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. The researchers also found that a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, but most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species.

     The study estimates that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci. This suggests that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability, while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions.

     The observed repeatability associated with inversions further supports the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions, rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive. Overall, the study provides new insights into the genetic basis of local adaptation in sunflowers and highlights the importance of inversions in facilitating adaptation.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that aging affects cells in different ways, but at the organ and tissue levels, aging tends to cause similar changes. The mammary epithelium, a layer of cells in the breast, is made up of two types of cells: luminal epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells. These cells are distinct and have different functions. As people age, the luminal epithelial cells undergo significant changes that are similar across individuals, which is concerning because these cells are thought to be the origin of breast cancer. The researchers hypothesized that aging affects the cells' ability to maintain their identity, making them more susceptible to cancer.

     To investigate this, the researchers analyzed the gene expression profiles of primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from women under 30 and over 55 years old. They found that, in addition to age-related changes in gene expression, there was an increase in transcriptional variance with age, which contributed to a loss of lineage fidelity. This means that the cells' ability to maintain their identity decreased with age.

     The researchers also found that both cell types responded to aging in similar ways, but the luminal epithelial cells showed more pronounced changes. These changes involved the regulation of chromatin and genome organizers, such as SATB1. Additionally, the expression of the gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age in epithelial cells. When the researchers modulated GJB6 expression in co-cultures, they found that it allowed communication between myoepithelial and luminal epithelial cells, driving changes in the luminal cells.

     The researchers used machine learning to develop a classifier that could distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue based on the luminal epithelial cells' gene expression profiles. This classifier was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. The study suggests that the luminal epithelial cells are the site where the effects of aging are integrated in the breast tissue, and their changes may contribute to the development of breast cancer. The researchers propose that the luminal epithelial cells may serve as a "biosensor" that predicts cancer susceptibility.
Scientists have long sought to understand why some plants are more resistant to pests and diseases than others. To do this, they often conduct large and labor-intensive experiments. However, a new study suggests that non-target DNA reads from plant sequencing data can serve as a proxy for phenotyping, or measuring, plant resistance. The researchers used data from a whole-genome and epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress (Thlaspi arvense) that were grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. They found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant heritability, and were associated with the climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, which are less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA loads, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes, as well as novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA loads. The study also found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, including differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. This study provides new insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads can be used to estimate the intensities of plant biotic interactions. This approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research, particularly with the increasing number of large sequencing datasets worldwide.

     Biomedical researchers have been searching for new ways to combat malaria, a disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. One approach is to use drug combinations that take advantage of a phenomenon called collateral sensitivity. This occurs when resistance to one drug makes a parasite more sensitive to another drug. In this study, scientists explored collateral sensitivity between compounds that target the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme. They tested a compound called TCMDC-125334, which was active against several mutant lines of the parasite, including one that had developed resistance to a clinical candidate drug called DSM265.

     The researchers found that the most common mechanism of resistance to TCMDC-125334 was a copy number variation of the dhodh gene, which codes for the DHODH enzyme. However, they also identified a mutation called DHODH I263S that made the parasite resistant to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. When they selected the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334, they found additional genetic changes in the dhodh gene. These double mutant parasites were less sensitive to TCMDC-125334 and highly resistant to DSM265.

     To test whether collateral sensitivity could be used to suppress the emergence of resistance, the researchers exposed wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation that were cross-resistant to both compounds and as fit as the wildtype parent in the lab. The emergence of these cross-resistant parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme.

     The study suggests that combining two DHODH inhibitors, DSM265 and TCMDC-125334, based on their collateral sensitivity profiles does not prevent the emergence of resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in the lab. The researchers identified a point mutation, DHODH I263S, that made the parasite resistant to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. They also found that sequentially selected parasites with additional mutations in dhodh were highly resistant to DSM265 but not cross-resistant to TCMDC-125334. This suggests that these parasites would still be sensitive to a therapeutic dose of TCMDC-125334. The study further characterized the interactions between the DHODH C276Y and DHODH F227Y mutations and found that the DHODH C276Y/F227Y double mutant is less sensitive than the DHODH C276Y parent but still more sensitive to TCMDC-125334 compared to wildtype parasites.
Biomedical researchers have long struggled to understand how antimalarial drug resistance emerges and spreads across different parts of the world. While most malaria infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, resistant strains often appear in regions with low transmission rates. Current models of resistance evolution have failed to reach a consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance. A new study has developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. The results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. This means that areas with higher malaria transmission rates tend to have lower levels of resistance. The study also found that resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions after the discontinuation of drugs, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. The research highlights the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution. The study's findings suggest that control protocols should vary from region to region and that there is no one-size-fits-all cure for malaria control worldwide. The inclusion of strain diversity in the model provides a new mechanistic explanation for why Southeast Asia has persisting resistance to certain antimalarial drugs, despite lower transmission intensity than Africa. In regions with low strain diversity, parasites cannot repeatedly infect hosts, leading to fewer clinically immune hosts carrying infections. The study's results have important implications for the development of effective malaria control strategies that take into account the unique characteristics of different biogeographic regions.

Summary
     Biologists have long studied how plants develop resistance to diseases, but similar research on animals has been limited. The zebrafish, a small freshwater fish, has hundreds of immune genes called NLRs, making it an ideal species to study this phenomenon. Researchers sequenced the DNA of 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations and found a total of 1513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of these NLRs are present in all wild populations, but only 4% are found in 80% or more of individual fish. In contrast, laboratory strains have significantly fewer NLRs, with up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population as wild fish.

     Despite the large number of NLR copies, the genetic diversity within these genes is surprisingly low, with around half of the copies being identical and the remaining ones having very few variations. This suggests that purifying selection, a process that eliminates genetic variations that are detrimental to the species, has played a significant role in shaping the evolution of NLRs in zebrafish. The researchers also found that the number of NLR copies varies greatly among individuals and populations, with some NLRs being present in all wild populations while others are restricted to a single population.

     The study's findings suggest that the evolution of NLRs in zebrafish is not neutral, meaning that the genes are not evolving randomly. Instead, the large number of NLR copies and the low genetic diversity suggest that these genes are under strong selective pressure to maintain their function. The researchers propose that the recent population bottleneck that led to the establishment of laboratory strains may have contributed to the reduction in NLR copy numbers and genetic diversity. The study lays the groundwork for future research into the molecular basis and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to the diversity of large vertebrate gene families.
Summary
     Scientists have discovered a new type of seed from the Late Devonian period, around 372-359 million years ago. The seed, called Alasemenia, has three wing-like structures that help it disperse in the wind. This is significant because most seeds from this time period did not have wings and were often enclosed in a protective cupule.

     Alasemenia was found in a fossil forest in China and is the second known seed from this time period that does not have a cupule. The seed's wings are thought to have evolved to help it photosynthesize and disperse in the wind. This discovery suggests that seeds with wings may have originated earlier than previously thought.

     The researchers compared Alasemenia to other seeds from the same time period and found that it has an advantage when it comes to wind dispersal. They used mathematical analysis to show that seeds with three wings are more efficient at dispersing in the wind than seeds with one, two, or four wings.

     The discovery of Alasemenia provides new insights into the evolution of seeds and their dispersal mechanisms. It suggests that seeds with wings may have evolved earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms, such as seed plumes and parachutes. The study also highlights the diversity of winged seeds from the Famennian period and the different functions they may have served.

     The researchers believe that Alasemenia's wings may have had multiple functions, including photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. This is in contrast to other seeds from the same time period, which were often enclosed in cupules and lacked wings. The discovery of Alasemenia and other winged seeds from the Famennian period is helping scientists to better understand the evolution of seeds and their dispersal mechanisms.

     Biomedical researchers have identified a new mechanism that contributes to the progression of Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, a type of blood cancer. The study found that a protein called RAPSYN works together with the BCR-ABL fusion protein, which is a hallmark of Ph+ leukemia, to promote the growth and survival of cancer cells. RAPSYN achieves this by adding a molecule called NEDD8 to BCR-ABL, making it more stable and resistant to degradation. This process, called neddylation, allows BCR-ABL to persist in the cell and continue to drive the development of leukemia.

     The researchers discovered that RAPSYN is highly expressed in patients with Ph+ leukemia and that its levels are correlated with those of BCR-ABL. They also found that RAPSYN's NEDD8 E3 ligase activity is essential for its ability to mediate BCR-ABL neddylation. Furthermore, the study showed that inhibiting RAPSYN or its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity reduces the stability of BCR-ABL and inhibits the growth of leukemia cells.

     The study's findings suggest that RAPSYN is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia. The researchers demonstrated that depleting RAPSYN expression or inhibiting its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity in mice with leukemia significantly prolonged their survival. These results indicate that targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation could provide an alternative approach to treating Ph+ leukemia, particularly for patients who have developed resistance to existing therapies.

     The study's findings also have broader implications for understanding the role of RAPSYN in other types of cancer. RAPSYN has been implicated in various cellular processes, including protein degradation and cell signaling, and its dysregulation has been linked to several types of cancer. Further research is needed to explore the potential of RAPSYN as a therapeutic target in other cancer types. Overall, the study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying Ph+ leukemia and highlights the potential of RAPSYN as a novel therapeutic target for this disease.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have been searching for new ways to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One promising approach is to use enzymes called peptidoglycan hydrolases, which break down the cell walls of bacteria, ultimately killing them. However, finding these enzymes can be challenging due to the limited availability of phage genomes. A team of scientists has developed a new strategy to identify active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes using a lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide as a template. This approach was tested on the proteome of Acinetobacter baumannii, a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics.

     The researchers used a peptide derived from a lysin called PlyF307 as a template to search for peptidoglycan hydrolases in the A. baumannii proteome database. They identified five potential enzymes, PHAb7-PHAb11, which were then tested for their ability to kill bacteria. Two of these enzymes, PHAb10 and PHAb11, showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens, even after being heated to 100°C for one hour. In contrast, the other three enzymes were sensitive to heat.

     The researchers also solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11, which revealed that PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme, while PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection were used to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. The results of this study provide new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs and highlight the potential of the antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy for identifying new peptidoglycan hydrolases with high bactericidal activity and desirable physicochemical properties.
Summary
     A recent study used data from the Danish National Patient Registry and electronic health records (EHRs) to identify patterns of symptoms in patients with pancreatic cancer. The researchers analyzed data from 6.9 million patients, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. They found that text mining of clinical notes in EHRs was able to capture more symptoms prior to diagnosis than the registry-based analysis. For example, symptoms such as "blood pressure reading without diagnosis," "abnormalities of heartbeat," and "intestinal obstruction" were not found in the registry-based analysis.

     The study also identified two groups of patients with lower median survival (less than 90 days) following specific symptom trajectories. These trajectories included "cough→jaundice→intestinal obstruction" and "pain→jaundice→abnormal results of function studies." The researchers suggest that these findings could be used to detect early risk factors for pancreatic cancer and improve screening procedures.

     The study used a combination of registry data and EHRs to generate and compare symptom and disease trajectories. They found that symptoms were more abundant in the EHRs than in the registry data. The researchers propose that this knowledge could be used to build longitudinal multi-modal trajectories for improved symptom extraction and early prediction of pancreatic cancer in clinical settings.

     The study's findings have implications for the detection and treatment of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer, and early detection is crucial for improving prognosis. By identifying patterns of symptoms prior to diagnosis, healthcare providers may be able to detect pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage, when it is more treatable. The study's use of EHRs and registry data also highlights the potential for harnessing the full potential of health data to improve patient outcomes.

     The researchers suggest that future studies could use advanced text mining techniques and artificial intelligence to build more comprehensive symptom trajectories. This could ultimately lead to better screening procedures and improved lives for patients with pancreatic cancer. The study's findings provide a comprehensive comparison of symptom trajectories in pancreatic cancer patients and highlight the importance of using multiple data sources to detect early risk factors for the disease.
Scientists have long known that a specific pattern of brain activity during sleep, known as the synchronization of fast sleep spindles with slow oscillations, is a key feature of adult sleep. However, little was known about how this pattern develops in children and adolescents. To investigate, researchers studied brain activity in children aged 5-6, 8-11, and 14-18 years, as well as young adults aged 20-26. They found that while the type of fast sleep spindles present in children was different from those in adults, the pattern of slow oscillations and fast sleep spindles was already present in all age groups, but was less precise in children. The researchers also found that the ability to generate adult-like fast sleep spindles was associated with more precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns across all age groups. This suggests that the development of adult-like fast sleep spindles plays a key role in the maturation of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood. The study used individualized detection of single events to analyze brain activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep in the four age groups. The researchers found that the frequency of adult-like fast sleep spindles increased with age, and that the differences in amplitude and density between development-specific and adult-like fast centro-parietal sleep spindles decreased with age. They also found that the neural rhythms that define the coupling between slow oscillations and fast sleep spindles undergo substantial changes during child and adolescent development. Overall, the study provides new insights into the development of sleep patterns in children and adolescents, and highlights the importance of adult-like fast sleep spindles in the maturation of slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns.
Summary
     Biomedical research articles often focus on genes that have been studied extensively in the past, despite the availability of high-throughput technologies that can identify novel genes associated with biological processes and disease. A recent analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. This bias is not due to a lack of underlying biological evidence, as understudied genes are frequently found as hits in high-throughput experiments but are not investigated further by the authors. In fact, publications on understudied genes may even receive more citations than those on better-studied genes.

     The study found that 33 out of 45 biological and experimental factors proposed to affect the choice of genes being studied are significantly associated with the selection of hit genes in -omics studies. These factors include evolutionary, chemical, and biological characteristics of the genes. The authors propose that the abandonment of understudied genes may be driven by the concern that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact.

     To address this bias, the researchers developed a tool called Find My Understudied Genes (FMUG), which allows scientists to identify and engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. FMUG is available for download as a MacOS/Windows app and can be used to promote the investigation of understudied genes. The authors demonstrate the utility of FMUG by identifying genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging.

     The study's findings suggest that understudied genes are abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. The authors propose that this bias may be driven by the concern that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact. The development of FMUG provides a tool for scientists to address this bias and promote the investigation of understudied genes.
Summary
     Artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides have been suggested as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened drinks. However, the potential negative effects of these sweeteners on blood vessel function are not well understood. A recent study used a zebrafish model to investigate the effects of glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development. The researchers found that both glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides induced excessive formation of blood vessels, particularly intersegmental vessels, in the zebrafish embryos. This excessive angiogenesis was caused by the activation of quiescent endothelial cells into tip cells.

     Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis revealed that the endothelial cells in the embryos exposed to high glucose had an increased ratio of capillary endothelial cells, proliferating endothelial cells, and upregulated proangiogenic genes. Further analysis showed that the foxo1a gene mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides by upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. The study also found that reducing foxo1a activity mitigated the excessive angiogenesis caused by monosaccharides.

     The researchers used a zebrafish model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis similar to the phenotypes observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) induced by glucose treatment. They found that both glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides activated quiescent endothelial cells into proliferating tip cells, leading to excessive angiogenesis. The effects of monosaccharides on inducing excessive angiogenesis were mediated by the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway.

     The study provides new evidence of the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms. The findings suggest that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides can lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent endothelial cells into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway. The study's results have provided novel insights into the roles of noncaloric monosaccharides in human health and the underlying mechanisms.
Biomedical researchers investigated how the brain processes and stores multiple sequences of information, such as remembering a series of colors and their corresponding locations. In the study, participants were asked to memorize a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations, and then reproduce the full sequence of colors and locations one after another. The researchers manipulated the consistency between the location and color sequence trajectories to see how it affected memory performance.

     The results showed that when the location and color sequences had consistent trajectories, participants performed better in memory tasks and demonstrated a correlation between the reproduced color and location sequences. Additionally, neural activity in the brain showed reactivation of common trajectories during both encoding and retention periods, and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling location sequences. This suggests that the brain uses a shared common structure to store multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, facilitating efficient information organization in working memory (WM).

     The researchers used EEG recordings to provide neural evidence for this "compressive" strategy, which involves reactivating shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and spontaneous replay of color sequences during location recall. The findings also showed that structure reactivation is related to WM behavior and neural replay. Furthermore, when participants prepared to recall location sequences, the currently task-irrelevant color sequence demonstrated a spontaneous sequential replay profile, highlighting the close bond between color and location sequences when they share a common trajectory.

     The study provides converging behavioral and neural evidence for the brain's ability to spontaneously leverage common structures to facilitate WM. Behaviorally, sequences with consistent color-location trajectories showed enhanced memory precision and a significant correlation between reproduced color and location sequence trajectories. The results support the idea that neural replay in WM mediates sequence combinations based on common structures, and suggest that the brain uses a shared common structure to store multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have made significant progress in understanding the genetic basis of PURA syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the human PURA gene. The PURA gene encodes a nucleic acid-binding protein that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes. However, unlike other monogenetic disorders, almost all mutations in the PURA gene result in the full disease penetrance, meaning that nearly all individuals with the mutation develop the condition.

     The study aimed to investigate how genetic variations causing PURA syndrome affect the functional and structural integrity of the PURA protein. The researchers observed that patient mutations across the PURA gene impair its ability to co-localize with processing bodies, which are cellular structures involved in RNA regulation. The mutations either destroyed the protein's folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization.

     To better understand the effects of these mutations, the researchers solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA. They combined these structures with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The results showed that the PURA protein has unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity, making it particularly susceptible to mutations that impair its structural integrity.

     The study found that even conservative mutations across the PURA gene result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome. This is in contrast to other genetic disorders, such as neurodevelopmental Rett syndrome, where pathogenic variations are typically found in hot-spot regions. Instead, pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence.

     The researchers also experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA and the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein's integrity. The study provides the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. The findings offer an explanation for why even conservative mutations across the PURA gene result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome.
Summary
     Biomedical research has identified a potential link between two proteins, TRPV4 and ANO1, in the regulation of perspiration. The study found that these proteins interact with each other and with aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in the secretory cells of sweat glands in mouse foot pads. This interaction is thought to play a crucial role in the water efflux of exocrine glands, which is essential for perspiration.

     The researchers used various methods to investigate the relationship between TRPV4, ANO1, and AQP5. They found that TRPV4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and AQP5 in secretory cells of sweat glands in mouse foot pads. Additionally, they discovered that TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were inhibited by menthol, a compound known to activate TRPM8.

     The study also showed that acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type mice but not in TRPV4-deficient mice. Furthermore, menthol inhibited sweating in both wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. The researchers also found that basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor.

     The study suggests that TRPV4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1. The researchers propose that targeting TRPV4 or the TRPV4/ANO1 complex could lead to the development of agents that regulate perspiration. This is supported by the finding that TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis (AIGA) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA.

     The study also explored the functional interaction of TRPV4 and ANO1 in sweat glands in mouse foot pads. They found that TRPV4-expressing secretory cells are involved in the secretion of macromolecular components as well as the secretion of water and ions. The researchers propose that the TRPV4/ANO1 complex promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse foot pads.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the diverse shapes and sizes of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for processing sensory information and controlling movement. Despite this diversity, a new study reveals that all primate cortices, including those of humans, chimpanzees, and monkeys, can be described using a universal mathematical framework. This framework, based on the concept of fractals, shows that the cortex is made up of nested folds of different sizes, which can be merged to form a common shape.

The researchers found that the cortices of 11 primate species, as well as over 70 other mammalian species, follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory. This means that the shape of the cortex remains consistent across different scales, from small to large. The study also discovered that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape, with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale.

The researchers demonstrated the importance of this new understanding by showing a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. They found that the effect of ageing on the brain's shape is much more pronounced at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm, with a fourfold increase in effect size compared to standard morphological analyses. This suggests that some biological processes, such as ageing, may only act on specific spatial scales, leaving other scales untouched.

The study proposes a new syntax for characterizing brain morphology and morphological changes, which is more detailed and informative than previous methods. This new approach can differentiate subtle morphological changes much better than current methods, with a fourfold increase in effect size. The researchers also suggest that this new understanding may generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. Overall, the study provides a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and a common set of mechanisms governing cortical folding.
Summary
     The RELA transcription factor plays a crucial role in regulating immune and stress responses in the body. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumours, RELA is overexpressed. Researchers used live single-cell imaging to study the dynamics of RELA in PDAC cells. They found that tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) stimulation causes RELA to rapidly and sustainably move into the cell's nucleus. The study also discovered that the movement of RELA is linked to the dynamics of F-actin, a component of the cell's cytoskeleton.

     The researchers used RNA sequencing to identify genes that are regulated by RELA in PDAC cells. They found that RELA upregulates the expression of two genes, NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, which are involved in regulating the actin network. Depleting these genes in PDAC cells altered the dynamics of RELA in response to TNFα stimulation. This suggests that there is a negative feedback loop between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31.

     The study also investigated the NF-κB pathway, which is a key regulator of immune responses. The researchers found that the NF-κB proteins NFKB1 and NFKB2 interact with RELA in PDAC cells, forming heterodimers. They also discovered that the IκB protein IκBβ plays a significant role in suppressing TNFα-induced nuclear RELA in PDAC cells.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the relationship between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells. The findings suggest that the dynamics of RELA are influenced by the actin network and that there are negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. The study also highlights the importance of the NF-κB pathway in regulating RELA in PDAC cells.
Biomedical research has shown that a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) in the brain is crucial for proper function. Disruptions in the GABAergic system, which regulates this balance, are common in neurological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in the Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTEN) gene, a key regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly linked to ASDs. However, it was unclear whether PTEN deficiencies affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling differently.

    Researchers used the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system to study the effects of PTEN mutations on GABAergic and cholinergic signaling. They found that mutations in the daf-18/PTEN gene specifically impacted GABAergic (inhibitory) neurodevelopment and function, but not cholinergic (excitatory) signaling. This selective impact resulted in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants were due to reduced activity of the DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor during development.

    The study also explored the potential therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets (KGDs), which have been shown to be effective for disorders associated with E/I imbalances. The researchers found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induced DAF-16/FOXO activity, thereby improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. This suggests that β-hydroxybutyrate may act early in development to mitigate neurological GABAergic defects in daf-18/PTEN mutants.

    The findings provide valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects, and shed light on the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of KGDs. The study demonstrates that mutations in daf-18, the C. elegans ortholog of PTEN, lead to defects in inhibitory GABAergic neurodevelopment without significantly affecting cholinergic excitatory signals. The results suggest that decreased activity of DAF-18/PTEN affects GABAergic development due to a downregulation of DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor activity. The study also highlights the conservation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in C. elegans, making it a useful model system for investigating the role of this pathway in neurodevelopment.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have made a significant discovery about the body's response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19. They found that a type of molecule called interleukin-1β (IL-1β) plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of the virus. IL-1β is a key player in the body's inflammatory response, and it has been shown to inhibit the formation of "syncytia," which are structures that allow the virus to spread from cell to cell.

     The researchers used a combination of laboratory and animal experiments to study the effects of IL-1β on SARS-CoV-2 infection. They found that IL-1β inhibited the formation of syncytia in various types of cells, including lung epithelial cells, which line the airways. They also showed that IL-1β reduced the spread of the virus in the lungs of mice infected with SARS-CoV-2.

     The researchers discovered that IL-1β works by activating a signaling pathway called RhoA/ROCK, which leads to the formation of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions. This prevents the formation of syncytia and limits the spread of the virus. They also found that IL-1β is effective against various strains of SARS-CoV-2 and other beta-coronaviruses.

     These findings highlight the importance of IL-1β in the body's response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest that it may be a potential therapeutic target for controlling the spread of the virus. The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the role of innate immune factors, such as cytokines, in controlling viral transmission. The discovery of IL-1β's antiviral function may lead to the development of new treatments for COVID-19 and other viral infections.
Summary
     Insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in Drosophila, the fruit fly, play a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis. These cells are similar to mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin directly into the circulation. Researchers used electrophysiological recordings to investigate how nutritional and internal state changes affect IPC activity. They found that the nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity, with activity decreasing during starvation and increasing after refeeding with glucose or fructose. However, non-nutritive sugars had no effect on IPC activity. In contrast to feeding, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, similar to the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application.

     In contrast to IPCs, diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (DH44PINs) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments showed that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. This suggests that populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity.

     The study demonstrates that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state. This highlights the complexity of insulin regulation, emphasizing that insulin secretion is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors. The findings suggest that Drosophila IPCs do not directly sense changes in hemolymph sugar levels, but rather respond to enteroendocrine signals. The study provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of metabolic homeostasis and the regulation of insulin release in Drosophila.
Summary
     Scientists have developed a new tool to study proteins in live human cells. This tool, called endogenous tagging, allows researchers to visualize and study proteins in their natural environment. However, creating human cell lines with endogenous tags has been challenging due to low efficiency. To overcome this, researchers used an engineered protein called split mNeonGreen to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in human cells.

     The split mNeonGreen system consists of two parts: a large fragment (mNG21-10) and a small fragment (mNG211). By expressing the large fragment in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), researchers can efficiently tag proteins with the small fragment. This allows for the study of protein function in healthy cells and across different cell types.

     In this study, researchers engineered an iPSC line to express the large fragment of split mNeonGreen and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins. They also demonstrated that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging of highly dynamic cellular processes, such as cytokinesis, in iPSCs. This work represents the first step towards creating a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells.

     The researchers used the split mNeonGreen system to efficiently target multiple genes for endogenous tagging and clonally isolated several tagged iPSC lines. This work provides the foundation for a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells and offers protocols for generating and studying endogenous tags in human iPSCs.

     The split mNeonGreen system has several advantages, including high complementation efficiency and irreversibility once the reconstituted protein has folded. It also retains most of the brightness of the original mNeonGreen protein. This system allows for easy and efficient endogenous tagging in cells where the large fragment is constitutively expressed.

     The generation of a genome-wide library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput. The split mNeonGreen system can be used as a tool for large-scale endogenous tagging, enabling researchers to study protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long used lesion studies to understand the connection between the brain and behavior. However, these studies have limitations when combined with multielectrode techniques used in systems neuroscience. To address this, a new method for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes has been developed. This technique allows for stable current delivery and controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology.

     A custom-built current source was designed to provide stable current and enable controlled lesions. The performance of this novel lesioning technique was validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning.

     The technique can be used in various areas of the cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This method is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population's role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss.

     The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this method by testing it with a linear multicontact probe in ex vivo rabbit cortex. They also showed that the technique can be used with different electrode types and animals, and that there are no particular limitations that would prevent it from working with any passive multielectrode probe. The electrolytic lesioning method presented here enables small, permanent inactivation volumes while maintaining reliable neuroelectrophysiological recordings. The selection of electrical current pattern, amplitude, and duration, as well as the specific lesion electrodes' shape and location, offers many different combinations for complementary investigations into the causal role of cortical activity.
Biologists have long been concerned about the impact of pesticides on bee populations, which are crucial for pollinating agricultural crops. One type of pesticide, neonicotinoids, has been shown to be particularly hazardous to bees. However, there is ongoing debate about whether bees can detect and avoid these pesticides in the nectar of flowers. To address this question, researchers conducted an experiment using a combination of behavioral assays and electrophysiology to test whether bumblebees can detect neonicotinoids in nectar.

The study focused on the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) and used a sucrose solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape (Brassica napus) to test the bees' ability to detect four different neonicotinoids: imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor. The researchers found that the bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing these pesticides, even at concentrations that were lethal to the bees. In fact, only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered the activity of the bees' gustatory neurons, which are responsible for detecting taste.

The study's findings suggest that bumblebees are unable to detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of neonicotinoids using information from their mouthparts. Since bees rarely come into contact with floral nectar with other body parts, the researchers predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.

The study's results are consistent with previous research that has shown that bees are not deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neonicotinoids. However, other studies have reported conflicting results, and the question of whether bees can taste and avoid neonicotinoids remains unresolved. The study's findings have significant implications for the use of neonicotinoids as a means of defending crops against pests, as they suggest that these pesticides may pose a risk to bee populations even if they are used in a way that is intended to minimize harm to bees.
Biomedical researchers have long struggled to understand the dynamics of zoonotic diseases, which are illnesses that can be transmitted from animals to humans. One such disease is Plasmodium knowlesi, a type of malaria that affects non-human primates (NHPs) and poses a significant threat to public health in Southeast Asia. A recent study aimed to address this knowledge gap by systematically analyzing reports of P. knowlesi infections in NHPs across the region.

The researchers compiled a dataset of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites in Southeast Asia and found that the prevalence of P. knowlesi varied greatly across different regions. The overall prevalence was relatively low, but estimates were significantly higher in Malaysian Borneo. Notably, the regions with higher P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs overlapped with areas where human infections have been reported.

The study also investigated the relationship between P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs and environmental factors, such as land conversion and fragmentation. By combining remote sensing data with statistical models, the researchers identified a novel link between P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs and forest fragmentation. This suggests that the complexity of the habitat may play a crucial role in determining the prevalence of the parasite.

The findings of this study have significant implications for public health interventions. By understanding the dynamics of P. knowlesi in NHPs, researchers can better predict the risk of human spillover and develop targeted strategies to prevent it. The study highlights the importance of considering the intersection of human epidemiology and wildlife ecology in addressing zoonotic diseases. The results also underscore the need for further research into the relationship between landscape complexity and P. knowlesi prevalence in NHPs.

Overall, this study provides new insights into the epidemiology of P. knowlesi in Southeast Asia and highlights the critical role of NHPs as a reservoir for this zoonotic disease. The findings have important implications for public health policy and conservation efforts in the region.
Summary
     The rise of flowering plants (angiosperms) and the breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana during the Mesozoic era marked significant changes in the relationships between insects and plants. To understand how these changes affected the interactions between weevils and their host plants, researchers reconstructed the evolutionary history of the beetle family Belidae using molecular data and fossil records. The study found that the crown group of Belidae originated around 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with coniferous plants (Pinopsida). The weevils likely developed in dead or decaying branches of these plants.

     As Gondwana broke apart, the weevils tracked their host plants to distant landmasses, adapting to new environments. When conifers declined, some weevils shifted to flowering plants (angiosperms) and cycads, developing new relationships, including mutualisms with cycads and associations with parasitic angiosperms that do not produce their own food. The study also found that the two main subfamilies of Belidae, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively.

     The researchers used molecular data and fossil records to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Belidae. They found that the most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae were conifers (Pinopsida) or flowering plants (angiosperms). In the Belinae subfamily, conifers were the most likely ancestral host plants. The study suggests that Belidae originated during the Jurassic period, associated with gymnosperms, and later colonized flowering plants as they diversified and became dominant during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene periods.

     The study also found that the two subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated and diverged during the separation of East and West Gondwana. Both subfamilies have lineages that still develop on their ancestral host plants. The study provides new insights into the evolutionary history of Belidae and the relationships between weevils and their host plants.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long known that mutations in growing cell populations, such as tumours, can serve as markers to track the past evolution of the tumour from current samples. However, the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution, or how tumours grow and change over time and space, is not well understood. To address this knowledge gap, a team of researchers used high-resolution genetic data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, a type of liver cancer, to study the early evolution of tumours in the body.

     The researchers used spatial metrics of evolution to analyze the growth patterns of tumour cells within the tumour volume. They found that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly throughout the tumour, rather than at the surface. This is in contrast to surface growth, where a specific dispersal mechanism has been proposed to account for the observed spatial distribution of mutations.

     The researchers also determined how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. They used whole-exome mutation data from late-stage tumours to infer how the tumours grew in earlier stages. To do this, they developed metrics of intra-tumour heterogeneity, which leverage the information from the spatial position of all samples.

     The study's findings provide new insights into the early evolution of tumours in the body and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. The researchers' methods can be used to analyze the growth patterns of tumours and understand how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour. This knowledge can ultimately inform the development of more effective treatments for cancer.

     The study builds on previous research that has linked spatial tumour sampling with evolution. However, this study is the first to use high-resolution data to analyze the growth patterns of tumour cells within the tumour volume. The findings have implications for our understanding of tumour evolution and can be applied to other types of cancer.
summary
     Biologists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain organisms to change their physical appearance in response to seasonal changes. Cacopsylla chinensis, a type of aphid, is one such organism that exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism, transforming from a summer-form to a winter-form with distinct morphological characteristics. While previous research has shown that low temperature and a specific temperature receptor, CcTRPM, play a crucial role in this transformation, the underlying neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism remained unknown.

     A recent study has shed light on the novel function of Bursicon, a hormone responsible for the hardening and darkening of insect cuticles, in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in C. chinensis. The researchers identified two subunits of Bursicon, CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β, which are regulated by low temperature and CcTRPM. These subunits form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle's chitin content and thickness.

     The study also discovered that CcBurs-R, a leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptor, acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the upstream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Furthermore, the researchers found that miR-6012, a microRNA, directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis.

     These findings provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor, revealing a novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism. The study suggests that Bursicon genes and their receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development, and that Bursicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects. Further research is needed to understand how Bursicon mediates the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric brain tumors that are resistant to current treatments. A specific mutation, known as H3-K27M, drives the development of these tumors by altering the epigenetic landscape of the cells. This mutation leads to the deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the activation of the oncogenic MYC pathway.

     Researchers have been searching for effective treatments for H3-K27M gliomas, and a promising approach involves targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and the MYC pathway. To test this strategy, scientists treated patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor that blocks MYC-driven tumors, in combination with Vorinostat, an HDAC inhibitor. The results showed a significant decrease in cell viability and a synergistic effect on the downregulation of oncogenic pathways, including mTOR.

     In vivo studies using patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models also demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor growth in mice treated with the combination of Sulfopin and Vorinostat. These findings highlight the potential of combined treatment with HDAC inhibitors and MYC inhibitors as a therapeutic approach for H3-K27M gliomas.

     Previous studies have shown that histone acetylation pathways are a potential target for treating H3-K27M gliomas. Pan-histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as Vorinostat and Panobinostat, have been found to inhibit growth and restore gene expression alterations in these tumors. The H3-K27M mutation also leads to the deregulation of epigenetic pathways affecting post-translational modifications of histone H3.

     High-level gene amplification of MYC is commonly observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas, and H3-K27M gliomas show high expression of MYC and its target genes due to both epigenetic alterations and structural variants. The PIN1 inhibitor, Sulfopin, has been shown to downregulate MYC target genes in vitro and block MYC-driven tumors in murine models of neuroblastoma. To address the need for an effective combination therapy for H3-K27M DMGs, researchers tested the dual targeting of histone acetylation and MYC activation using Vorinostat and Sulfopin. The results suggest that this combination may be a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.
summary
     The white-footed deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, the deermouse shows no apparent disability or diminished fitness. To understand how the deermouse tolerates these infections, researchers compared its genome-wide transcription response to the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with that of mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus). The study found that the deermouse had a distinct LPS response profile, characterized by non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. In contrast to mice and rats, the deermouse displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics were also observed in a Borrelia hermsii infection model. The study suggests that the deermouse's infection tolerance is associated with reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors. The results provide a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and potentially other animal reservoirs for human diseases. The deermouse's LPS response profile was distinct from that of mice, with down-regulated genes related to leukocyte activation and migration, and up-regulated genes related to viral response, interferon-beta, and protozoan response. The study also found that the deermouse had a restrained transcriptional response to LPS, with lower fold-changes in genes such as Mmp8, Slpi, S100a9, and Il1b. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the mechanisms of infection tolerance in the white-footed deermouse and its role as a reservoir for zoonotic diseases.
Summary
     Caspases are a family of enzymes that play a crucial role in programmed cell death, including a process called pyroptosis. Pyroptosis is a form of cell death that involves the activation of a protein called gasdermin E (GSDME), which is cleaved by caspases. In humans, caspase 3 (CASP3) can cleave GSDME, but caspase 7 (CASP7) cannot. However, researchers found that a pufferfish GSDME can be cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7.

     The researchers used domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME to identify the regions responsible for the cleavage of GSDME by CASP7. They found that the C-terminus of GSDME and the p10 subunit of CASP7 determine the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. The p10 subunit contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination.

     The researchers also found that this key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and most vertebrate CASP7, except in mammals. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates, such as mice, but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 can cleave human GSDME, but not mouse GSDME.

     These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates. The results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.

     The researchers identified a teleost GSDME that can be cleaved by both fish and human CASP3/7 to trigger pyroptosis. They found that mutation of the cleavage site inhibited pyroptosis and significantly decreased LDH release and TrGSDME cleavage. These results indicated that TrCASP3/7 cleavage was required to activate TrGSDME-mediated pyroptosis.

     The study suggests that the functional divergence of CASP7 from CASP3 may have occurred as a result of specific and non-redundant regulation of programmed cell death mediated by different executor molecules in mammals. The findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the evolution of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrates.
Summary
     Ketamine has emerged as a promising treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but its molecular mechanisms and neural effects are not yet fully understood. A recent study aimed to investigate the relationship between ketamine's molecular mechanisms and its neural and behavioral effects in healthy individuals. The study involved 40 participants who received a single dose of ketamine and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure changes in brain connectivity. The results showed that ketamine's effects on the brain were multi-dimensional and varied significantly between individuals. The study also found that the neural effects of ketamine were associated with changes in the expression of specific genes, including somatostatin (SST) and parvalbumin (PVALB), which are involved in regulating neural activity.

     The study's findings suggest that ketamine's effects on the brain are complex and influenced by individual differences in brain function and gene expression. The results also highlight the importance of considering individual variability in response to ketamine and other treatments for depression. The study's authors propose that a multi-dimensional approach to understanding ketamine's effects could lead to the development of more precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.

     The study's findings are consistent with previous research on ketamine's effects on the brain, which have shown that it can increase global brain connectivity and induce a shift from a cortical to a subcortically-centred brain state. However, the current study provides new insights into the relationship between ketamine's molecular mechanisms and its neural effects, and highlights the need for further research into the complex interactions between brain function, gene expression, and treatment response.

     The study's results also have implications for the development of new treatments for depression and other psychiatric disorders. By understanding the individual differences in response to ketamine and other treatments, clinicians may be able to develop more personalized treatment plans that take into account a patient's unique brain function and genetic profile. This could lead to more effective treatments and improved outcomes for patients with depression and other psychiatric disorders.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-replicating units of life existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. However, these early genomes faced a problem: their replication speed decreased due to product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands. To address this issue, researchers tested the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under constant total population size and chemostat conditions. The study found that large population sizes and small differences in replication rates favored the stable coexistence of most replicator species, alleviating the error threshold problem compared to exponential amplification. Additionally, sequence properties and resource competition determined the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation.

The study aimed to quantify the heritable information-maintaining potential of finite populations of unlinked, RNA-like template replicators displaying parabolic growth. Using a constant population model, the researchers investigated how diversity-maintaining mechanisms operated in the parabolic regime in a finite population of replicators. They found that parabolic coexistence was resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication, proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world.

The study also considered a chemostat model of parabolic replication, taking into account monomer building block resources. They demonstrated that increased competition, mediated by a decrease in the resource influx rate, could induce a switch from coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest. The demonstrated diversity-maintaining mechanism of finite parabolic populations can be used as a plug-in model to investigate the coevolution of naked and encapsulated molecular replicators.

Parabolic population growth can sustain an unlimited number of competing replicator species in the infinite population size limit, and is inherently prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, a feature that can efficiently damp competition and promote coexistence. The study suggests that stochastic parabolic growth could have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes.
Summary
     The main protease of SARS-CoV-2, called Nsp5, plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to replicate by cleaving viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides. Researchers have discovered that Nsp5 also targets a human enzyme called TRMT1, which is necessary for a common modification in transfer RNAs (tRNAs). When human cells are infected with SARS-CoV-2, the levels of TRMT1 protein decrease, and the enzyme's ability to modify tRNAs is impaired. This is because Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific site, rendering it inactive. The cleavage fragments of TRMT1 have altered properties and are unable to restore tRNA modification in cells lacking TRMT1. As a result, cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 have reduced levels of viral RNA compared to cells with normal TRMT1 levels. These findings suggest that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and disruption of tRNA modification patterns contribute to the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The study also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection is associated with decreased TRMT1 levels and reduced levels of a specific type of tRNA modification. Furthermore, the study showed that TRMT1 expression is necessary for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. The researchers identified a specific sequence in TRMT1 that matches the consensus sequence of Nsp5 cleavage sites in SARS-CoV-2 polyproteins, and a mutation in this sequence inhibited Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1. Overall, the study provides evidence that Nsp5-dependent cleavage of TRMT1 and disruption of tRNA modification patterns play a role in the cellular pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long been puzzled by the existence of microbes that are not inherently disease-causing, but can become pathogenic under certain conditions. These microbes, known as opportunistic pathogens, are thought to have evolved from environmental microbes that took advantage of an ecological opportunity. One hypothesis is that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host.

     To test this idea, researchers evolved replicate populations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. As a result, the yeast populations developed increased adherence to the plastic surface, as well as two multicellular phenotypes: biofilm formation and flor formation. Another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to nutrient limitation.

     The researchers then tested the evolved yeast strains against wax moth larvae and found that the hyper-multicellular strains were significantly more likely to kill the larvae than the non-multicellular strains. This suggests that the selection for plastic adherence led to the evolution of enhanced multicellularity and increased virulence.

     The study supports the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, "accidental" pathogens. The findings have implications for our understanding of the evolution of pathogenicity and the potential for microbes to become disease-causing under certain conditions. The study also highlights the importance of considering the role of environmental selection in shaping the evolution of microbial traits.

     The researchers used the greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, as a model organism to test the virulence of the evolved yeast strains. This invertebrate model is commonly used to study microbial pathogenesis and virulence. The study demonstrates that direct selection on a specific trait, in this case plastic adherence, can lead to the evolution of correlated traits, including those associated with virulence.

     The findings of this study have implications for our understanding of the evolution of pathogenicity and the potential for microbes to become disease-causing under certain conditions. They also highlight the importance of considering the role of environmental selection in shaping the evolution of microbial traits.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains (PLDs) are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations, which can lead to the formation of abnormal biomolecular condensates. These condensates are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). To better understand how amino acid mutations affect the stability of PLDs, researchers used a computational model called Mpipi to simulate the behavior of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins.

     The simulations revealed the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested. The researchers found that the effects of successive mutations can be predicted by the addition of the appropriate laws, as long as the resulting mutation keeps within PLD composition and patterning biases.

     The study demonstrates that scaling laws can be used to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates based on amino acid sequence mutations. The researchers employed a systematic approach to vary the amino acid sequence of the PLDs considered and determined how the phase behavior of PLDs changes with amino acid compositional perturbations. They found that the changes in the critical solution temperatures of PLDs, as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations, can indeed be quantified by scaling laws, which are conserved across the family of PLDs investigated.

     The study provides a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules. The researchers organized the data in a table to facilitate the interpretation of the scaling laws derived in the study, which illustrates the effect of single point mutations on the critical solution temperatures of the family of PLDs, as a function of the PLD length. The findings suggest that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates, offering a new framework to describe the phase behavior of a large set of protein variants.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to use brain signals to predict an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition. Traditionally, this has been done by analyzing structural aspects of the brain, such as connectivity or thickness, or by averaging brain activity over time. However, these approaches overlook a crucial aspect of brain function: the unique patterns of brain activity that unfold over time. To address this limitation, a new approach has been proposed that uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to describe dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns in the brain. The HMM is combined with the Fisher kernel, a mathematical tool that can be used to predict individual traits.

     The HMM-Fisher kernel approach preserves the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is particularly important in studies with small sample sizes or heterogeneous training and test sets. The researchers demonstrated the potential of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach by applying it to an example fMRI dataset and simulated data. They focused on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans acquired during wakeful rest.

     The results showed that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach accurately and reliably predicts individual traits from brain dynamics models trained on neuroimaging data. The approach was compared to other prediction methods, including those that ignore the structure of the brain dynamics model, a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, and methods based on time-averaged functional connectivity. The HMM-Fisher kernel approach outperformed these methods, leveraging information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction.

     This new approach has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine. It has the potential to provide a more accurate and reliable way to predict individual traits from brain signals, which could lead to better diagnosis and treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders. The researchers suggest that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach could be used to develop more effective treatments and interventions tailored to an individual’s unique brain dynamics.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how a protein called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) contributes to Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Crohn’s disease. Recent studies have shown that LRRK2 variants associated with these diseases lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. However, the mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined.

     To address this knowledge gap, researchers conducted a targeted siRNA screen to identify regulators of LRRK2 activity. They identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods, the researchers demonstrated that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation.

     The study found that PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. These data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrates at the lysosome.

     The researchers hypothesized that enhanced recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes may promote Rab phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of LRRK2 in proximity to its Rab substrates. They examined whether two PD-linked genetic variants associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, also had increased levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes.

     The study found that Rab12 regulates LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediates LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage. Increased LRRK2 kinase activity is observed with pathogenic PD-linked variants and in sporadic PD patients, but many questions remain regarding the mechanisms by which LRRK2 activation is regulated basally and in response to endolysosomal stress associated with disease.

     The researchers identified Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activation and demonstrated that Rab12 plays a critical role in mediating LRRK2-dependent Rab phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. They found that Rab12 promotes Rab phosphorylation by recruiting LRRK2 to lysosomes following lysosomal membrane rupture. Pathogenic PD variants, including VPS35 D620N and LRRK2 R1441G, also result in increased levels of LRRK2 and pT73 Rab10 on lysosomes. Together, the data delineate a conserved mechanism by which LRRK2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal damage and genetic variants associated with disease.
Summary
     Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. Current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, but non-adherent cells remain challenging to analyze. To address this gap, researchers combined a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI (CA)2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells.

     The method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics. The researchers tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. The cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available. It provides detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions.

     The FUCCI (CA)2 technology uses fluorescent markers to demarcate cell cycle phases through color-coding. Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy, have shown promise in detailing cell cycle dynamics at the single-cell level. The described work allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per experimental condition by using image and data analysis pipelines to automatically perform image processing, cell tracking, filtering of incorrect tracks, and cell cycle phases identification and characterization.

     The image and data analysis workflows rely on two different software, Fiji and R, which are widely used by the imaging and data analysis community. The scripts were made publicly available, enabling customization to tailor the workflow according to specific requirements. This not only streamlines the cell cycle analysis of cells expressing the FUCCI (CA)2 indicator but also makes it accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge.

     The cell cycle analysis system is a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells. It provides a complete protocol for the cell cycle analysis of adherent and non-adherent cells expressing the FUCCI (CA)2 technology in a fully automated manner. The original time-lapse images were composed by red and green channels, detecting respectively the mCherry and mVenus markers of the FUCCI (CA)2 indicator.
Scientists have long debated the role of social and ecological factors in shaping the cognitive abilities of primates. To investigate this question, researchers used a combination of brain imaging and behavioral data from 16 primate species. They measured the size of two brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which are involved in metacognition and working memory, respectively.

The study found that the size of these brain regions, as well as the overall brain size, was best explained by three factors: body mass, daily traveled distance (a measure of ecological constraints), and population density (a measure of social constraints). This suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. The researchers also found that the FP was more sensitive to social constraints than the DLPFC, which is consistent with laboratory studies showing that the FP is involved in complex social interactions.

The study's findings support the idea that ecological constraints, such as foraging complexity, play a significant role in shaping the evolution of cognitive abilities in primates. The researchers also found that the size of the DLPFC, which is involved in working memory and planning, was related to daily traveled distance and, to a lesser extent, population density. This suggests that working memory and planning skills are critical for foraging in primates, especially when they need to travel long distances and navigate complex environments.

The study highlights the importance of considering both social and ecological factors in understanding the evolution of cognitive abilities in primates. The findings also provide new insights into the specific neuro-cognitive operations associated with foraging strategies in primates. Further research is needed to explore the metacognitive processes underlying social and foraging processes in the wild, as well as their interactions. Overall, the study provides a new perspective on the evolution of cognitive abilities in primates and highlights the importance of considering the complex interplay between social and ecological factors.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise. A key question has been whether this growth is due to an increase in the size of the myofibrils within the muscle fibers (myofibril hypertrophy) or an increase in the number of myofibrils (myofibrillogenesis). To address this question, a team of researchers developed a new method for visualizing myofibrils using a standard fluorescence microscope. This method, called fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution (FIM-ID), allows for high-resolution images of myofibrils and enables automated measurements of their size and number.

     The researchers validated the accuracy of FIM-ID by comparing its measurements to those obtained using electron microscopy (EM), a more time- and cost-intensive method. They found that FIM-ID measurements were indistinguishable from EM-based measurements. Using FIM-ID, the researchers then examined muscle biopsies from mice and humans who had undergone resistance exercise. They found that the radial growth of muscle fibers in response to increased mechanical loading was largely due to an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than an increase in the size of individual myofibrils.

     This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of muscle growth and offers a time- and cost-effective method for studying muscle biology. The FIM-ID method can be used by a wide range of researchers to study muscle growth and development. The findings of this study have important implications for our understanding of muscle growth and development, and could potentially inform the development of new exercise programs and treatments for muscle-related disorders.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have identified three mutations in the SNAP25 gene that cause a severe form of epilepsy called epileptic encephalopathy. These mutations, V48F, D166Y, and I67N, disrupt the normal functioning of the SNAP25 protein, which plays a crucial role in the release of neurotransmitters from neurons. The researchers studied the effects of these mutations on the process of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which is the release of vesicles containing neurotransmitters from the neuron to the synapse.

     The study found that all three mutations reduced the ability of the SNAP25 protein to bind to another protein called synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1), which is essential for vesicle docking and fusion. As a result, the mutations impaired the release of neurotransmitters from the vesicles. The V48F and D166Y mutations led to an increase in spontaneous release of neurotransmitters, while the I67N mutation resulted in a decrease in spontaneous release.

     The researchers also found that the V48F and D166Y mutations increased the release probability and lowered the energy barrier for fusion, making it easier for the vesicles to release their contents. In contrast, the I67N mutation increased the energy barrier for fusion, making it harder for the vesicles to release their contents. The study suggests that these mutations cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion, leading to the development of epileptic encephalopathy.

     The researchers used a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments to study the effects of the mutations. They found that the V48F and D166Y mutations increased the association of SNAP25 with other SNARE proteins, leading to unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutation decreased the association of SNAP25 with other SNARE proteins, leading to a decrease in membrane fusion.

     The study provides new insights into the role of SNAP25 in the regulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and the development of epileptic encephalopathy. The findings have implications for the development of mechanism-based treatments for this disorder, which is caused by single-point mutations in the SNAP25 gene. The study highlights the complexity of the interactions between SNAP25 and other proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis and the need for a better understanding of these interactions to develop effective treatments.
Summary
     A recent study analyzed data from 30 countries and thousands of researchers to investigate the relationship between the proportion of women in a discipline and the quality of research produced. The findings suggest that disciplines with a higher proportion of women tend to have lower research quality evaluations and lower funding success rates, regardless of the gender of the researchers involved. This correlation holds true even when accounting for factors such as age, research institution, and publishing patterns.

     The study used two independent datasets to examine research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores. It found a strong correlation between the evaluated quality of a researcher's work and the gender balance of their discipline. Researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines received lower evaluations, while those in male-dominated disciplines received higher evaluations. The study also found that funding success rates displayed a similar correlation, with researchers in male-dominated disciplines having higher success rates than those in female-dominated disciplines.

     The study's findings do not suggest that research done in female-dominated disciplines is inherently of lower quality. Rather, it appears that research from these disciplines is consistently evaluated as lower quality than research from male-dominated disciplines. This has a negative impact on everyone in those disciplines, but disproportionately affects women. The study's authors speculate that this may be an outcome of the feminization of a discipline over time, although they note that this cannot be confirmed with the available data.

     The study builds on previous research that has shown that women's work is often valued less than men's, regardless of the quality of the work. The findings have implications for how research is evaluated and funded, and highlight the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors that influence research quality and success.
Summary
     Scientists have long sought to design molecular circuits within living cells that can process information in a predictable manner, similar to electronic circuits. To achieve this, researchers have been exploring the use of genome editing tools, such as CRISPR-Cas9, to modulate the expression of target genes or record information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events, such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity, to trigger genome editing has proven challenging.

     A new strategy, called P3 editing, has been developed to address this challenge. P3 editing links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. This is achieved by engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, allowing various known protein-protein interactions and chemically induced dimerization of protein domains to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells.

     The researchers demonstrated that P3 editing can be used to control genome editing via specific interactions between a pair of tagged protein domains. To improve the efficiency and specificity of P3 editing, the crRNA-MS2/BoxB-petracrRNA design was engineered. This design mimics the functional molecules within the native CRISPR-Cas9 system and allows for the use of protein-protein interactions or proximity events to promote the formation of the active CRISPR-gRNA complex.

     Additionally, the researchers explored the potential of P3 editing to incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, enabling specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. This could potentially expand the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits. The strategy of P3 editing enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells. Overall, the development of P3 editing represents a significant step forward in the field of synthetic biology, enabling the design of more complex and programmable molecular circuits.
Summary
     The KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex plays a crucial role in the heart by mediating the slow delayed-rectifier current (IKs), which is essential for the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. However, mutations in this complex can lead to long QT syndrome (LQTS), a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutic approach for LQTS is to target the IKs channels to restore their function and normalize the QT interval.

     Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to activate KCNQ1 channels and increase IKs currents. PUFAs bind to two different sites on the channel, one in the voltage sensor domain and the other in the pore domain, shifting the voltage dependence to more negative voltages and increasing the maximal conductance of the channels. However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the maximal conductance of IKs channels is not well understood.

     Research suggests that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 channels is normally unstable, contributing to their low open probability. PUFAs may increase the maximal conductance of IKs channels by stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. This is in contrast to other Kv channels, such as Shaker K+ channels, which are inactivated more in low K+ conditions.

     PUFAs have been shown to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week. They increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, described as a "lipoelectric mechanism." This mechanism involves shifting the voltage dependence of activation and increasing the maximal conductance of the channels.

     The KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex is expressed in the heart and generates the slow delayed-rectifier current, an important contributor to the repolarizing phase of the ventricular action potential. Loss-of-function mutations of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex are associated with LQTS, causing a reduction of the channel current and a significant prolongation of the ventricular action potential waveform. Restoring the physiological duration of the QT interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in various human brain disorders, but the molecular mechanisms behind this link are not well understood. Researchers have been searching for alternative therapeutic approaches to address this issue. One potential target is pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase (PDXP), an enzyme that controls the levels of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP), the active form of vitamin B6. However, there have been no pharmacological inhibitors of PDXP to test this concept. A new study has identified a decline in PDXP and PLP levels in the hippocampus of mice with age, providing a rationale for developing PDXP inhibitors. The researchers used a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry to discover 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7,8-DHF binds to PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency, and it increases PLP levels in mouse hippocampal neurons in a PDXP-dependent manner. This finding validates PDXP as a druggable target for controlling intracellular PLP levels in the brain. Notably, 7,8-DHF is a well-studied molecule in brain disorder models, but its mechanism of action has been debated. The discovery of 7,8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor provides new insights into its effects in the brain. The study suggests that PDXP inhibitors like 7,8-DHF could be explored as a therapeutic approach to address vitamin B6-associated pathologies. The researchers also found that the expression of PDXP is upregulated in the hippocampi of middle-aged mice, indicating that vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not be sufficient to elevate intracellular PLP levels under certain conditions. Overall, the study provides a new direction for research into the molecular mechanisms of vitamin B6 deficiency and its effects on the brain.
Biologists have long sought to understand how the complex process of organogenesis, or the formation of organs, is coordinated during development. A key aspect of this process is the proper production and positioning of diverse cell types. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, researchers have been studying the development of the gonad, a vital organ responsible for reproduction. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure, guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which arise from the asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs). However, the mechanisms controlling the polarity of these SGPs, Z1 and Z4, have remained poorly understood.

    A recent study has shed light on this process, revealing that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins: CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20. The researchers found that CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse polarity in Z1 and normal polarity in Z4. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. The study also demonstrated that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration.

    The researchers further analyzed the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. They found that in lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 (RNAi) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the importance of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ.

    The study's findings provide new insights into the complex process of organogenesis and the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs. The results also suggest that the distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 are key to their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. This research has significant implications for our understanding of developmental biology and the mechanisms underlying the formation of complex organs.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to develop multidrug therapies that can combat resistance by exploiting tradeoffs, where resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable has remained unclear. To address this question, a team of scientists conducted evolution experiments using yeast cells and the antifungal drug fluconazole. They used a technique called lineage-tracking to capture a wide range of mutations that provided a fitness advantage in the presence of the drug. The researchers then quantified the fitness tradeoffs for each of the 774 evolved mutants across 12 different environments.

     The results showed that the mutants grouped into six distinct classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. Some mutants that resisted single drugs did not resist their combination, while others did. Additionally, mutants to the same gene had different tradeoffs than others. These findings highlight the complexity of relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. However, the study also suggests that by grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, it may be possible to develop multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance.

     The researchers used a high-throughput evolutionary approach to enumerate classes of drug-resistant mutants and their associated tradeoffs. They performed multiple laboratory evolutions in a range of fluconazole concentrations and sometimes in combination with a second drug to enhance the diversity of drug-resistant mutants. The study found that the mutations that provide the strongest fitness advantage often dominate evolution, making it difficult to capture a full spectrum of mutations. However, the researchers were able to identify at least six distinct groups with characteristic fitness tradeoffs across the 12 environments surveyed.

     The study's findings have implications for the development of multidrug regimens that exploit tradeoffs. The researchers suggest that by grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, it may be possible to reduce the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from over 774 to a manageable panel of six types for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness. This approach could guide efforts to map the phenotypic effects of mutation and potentially lead to the development of more effective multidrug treatments.
summary
     The central tendency bias, also known as contraction bias, is a phenomenon where the brain's judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy for the brain to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, another type of bias, recency bias or serial dependence, is also commonly observed and is thought to reflect the content of working memory.

     Recent studies have suggested that both biases may be more related than previously thought. A study using an auditory delayed comparison task in rats found that when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. This suggests that the PPC plays a key role in modulating contraction bias.

     The study proposes a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior. According to the model, a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience produces short-term sensory history biases, which naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors occurring at the level of individual trials are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory towards the sensory distribution's mean.

     The results of the study are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. The study also validates its model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task.

     Contraction bias has been repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities, where performance in perceptual tasks seems to reflect a shift of the working memory representation towards the mean of the sensory history. Additionally, biases towards the most recent sensory stimuli have also been documented. The study suggests that contraction bias emerges as a statistical effect of errors in working memory, occurring due to the persisting memory of stimuli shown in the preceding trials.

     The integration of this persisting memory in the working memory module competes with that of the stimulus in the current trial, giving rise to short-term history effects. The study's findings provide new insights into the neural mechanisms underlying working memory and its biases, and have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes sensory information.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have been searching for new ways to improve the effectiveness of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and chemotherapy in treating lung cancer. A recent study identified a protein called PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDLIM2) as a potential target for improving lung cancer therapy. PDLIM2 acts as a tumor suppressor and is often repressed in lung cancer, leading to resistance to ICIs and chemotherapy.

     The study used human clinical samples and a mouse model of lung cancer to investigate PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in the disease. The researchers found that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. They then developed a nano-delivery system to deliver PDLIM2 expression plasmids to the tumor site, which they called nanoPDLIM2.

     The study showed that systemic administration of nanoPDLIM2 had low toxicity and high tumor specificity, and significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs. In fact, the combination of nanoPDLIM2 with anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs led to complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice. The researchers also found that nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR1) induction and survival genes, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, making the tumors more sensitive to ICIs and chemotherapy.

     The study established a clinically applicable PDLIM2-based combination therapy with great efficacy for lung cancer and possibly other "cold" cancers. The researchers believe that this therapy could be applicable to other cancers as well, since PDLIM2 repression has been linked to numerous human cancers other than lung cancer. The study provides a firm basis for combining ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers. The combination of nanoPDLIM2, anti-PD-1, and chemotherapeutic drugs showed a high safety profile and induced complete remission of all lung tumors in most animals.
Scientists have long known that animals must be able to assess the quality of their food in order to survive in challenging environments. However, the mechanisms that allow animals to do this are not yet fully understood. A new study has shed light on how animals evaluate the quality of their food and adjust their feeding behavior accordingly. The researchers developed a system to test how animals respond to low-quality food and found that a type of bacteria called heat-killed E. coli triggers a cellular response that encourages animals to avoid it. This response is mediated by a complex system involving the unfolded protein response (UPRER) and the innate immune system. The UPRER is a cellular stress response pathway that is activated when the cell is under stress, such as when it is exposed to a toxin like heat-killed E. coli. The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense against infection and is responsible for recognizing and responding to pathogens. In this study, the researchers found that the UPRER and innate immune system work together to evaluate the quality of food and trigger an avoidance response to low-quality food. They also found that animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment by supplementing their diet with sugar, which inhibits the stress response and allows them to survive. The study suggests that the UPRER and innate immune system are key components of a physiological food evaluation system that allows animals to assess the nutritional value of their food and make informed decisions about what to eat. This system is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation that helps animals survive in environments where food is scarce or of poor quality. The researchers hope that their findings will contribute to a better understanding of how animals evaluate the quality of their food and how this process can be used to improve animal health and nutrition.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that carbohydrates play a crucial role in various biological processes, but their direct interaction with important drug targets, such as G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), remains poorly understood. GPCRs are a major class of proteins that respond to a wide range of signals, including hormones, neurotransmitters, and other molecules. In this study, researchers focused on P2Y purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a drug target involved in inflammation and immune responses, to investigate how carbohydrates activate GPCRs.

     The researchers used a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and functional studies to identify the sugar nucleotide activation of P2Y14. They found that UDP-glucose, a type of sugar molecule, can activate the receptor by binding to a specific site on the receptor. This binding site is located between two transmembrane helices, TM2 and TM7, and is stabilized by a conserved salt bridge, known as the KDKE chain.

     The researchers also discovered that the KDKE chain is a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12). They used this knowledge to design three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12, which are molecules that activate the receptor. These findings not only expand our understanding of how carbohydrates activate purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the development of carbohydrate-based drugs for GPCRs.

     The study highlights the importance of carbohydrates in modulating GPCRs and suggests that carbohydrates may be used as a new class of drugs for treating various diseases. The researchers also identified a conserved carbohydrate-binding motif in both P2Y12 and P2Y14, which may be present in other GPCRs. Further investigations are needed to determine whether other GPCRs can be activated by carbohydrates and to explore the potential therapeutic applications of carbohydrate-based drugs.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that stem cells rely on a specific environment, called a niche, to regulate their behavior. In the fruit fly Drosophila, neural stem cells called neuroblasts (NBs) are surrounded by glial niche cells. However, it was unclear whether these glial cells play a role in controlling the self-renewal and differentiation of NBs. Researchers have now discovered that glial cells produce a protein called ferritin, which helps transport iron into NBs. This iron is essential for the energy production and self-renewal of NBs.

     The study found that knocking down the genes responsible for ferritin production in glial cells led to a shortage of energy in NBs, causing them to proliferate less and differentiate prematurely. This was due to a decrease in aconitase activity and NAD+ levels, which are crucial for energy production. The researchers also found that ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression, as knocking down glial ferritin led to a significant decrease in tumor size in larval brains.

     The study suggests that glial cells are essential for maintaining the self-renewal of NBs, and that the glial niche plays a critical role in brain development. The researchers propose a novel mechanism of bicellular iron homeostasis, where glial cells store iron in ferritin and allocate it to NBs as needed. This mechanism relieves NBs from the risk of iron overload-induced oxidative stress and allows glial cells to clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets.

     The study's findings have implications for understanding the regulation of stem cell behavior and the development of brain tumors. The researchers suggest that bicellular iron homeostasis may exist in other stem cells and their niches, and that targeting glial ferritin could be a potential strategy for tumor treatment. The study provides new insights into the complex interactions between stem cells and their niche, and highlights the importance of glial cells in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells.
Summary
     Despite cancer being considered a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality, several countries reported that cancer deaths remained within historic levels during the pandemic. A new study examined the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US. The researchers compared mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. They found that nationally in 2020, multiple cause cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to approximately 13,600 excess deaths. The mortality elevation was higher for less deadly cancers, such as breast, colorectal, and hematological cancers, than for cancers with a poor survival rate, like lung and pancreatic cancers. In contrast, there was a substantial elevation in multiple cause deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer's (19%). To understand these differences, the researchers simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. They found that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19. The study suggests that the lack of excess cancer mortality during the pandemic reflects the competing mortality risk from cancer itself, rather than protection conferred from immunosuppression. The results demonstrate the importance of considering multiple cause-of-death records to accurately reflect changes in coding practices associated with the emergence of a new pathogen. The study also highlights the need to consider the size and age of the population living with cancer, as well as life expectancy under cancer diagnosis, when examining mortality patterns during the pandemic.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that R-loops, a type of RNA-DNA hybrid structure, can form during gene transcription and are associated with various diseases. However, the mechanisms behind their removal from eukaryotic genomes were not well understood. A recent study has shed light on this process, revealing a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in removing R-loops from chromosomes.

     The Smc5/6 complex is a core regulator of chromosome architecture, and researchers found that it binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation. This binding promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity. The study demonstrated that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by various genomic transactions, including gene transcription and telomere length regulation.

     R-loops are most frequently observed at highly transcribed genes but can also form at telomeres and near DNA replication forks. The study found that yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, the researchers demonstrated that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro.

     The study suggests that the Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels in the cellular response to R-loop formation. First, it contributes to RNase H-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids from genomic DNA. The Smc5/6 complex's role in this process is substantial but not as extensive as that of RNase H enzymes. The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms behind R-loop removal and highlight the importance of the Smc5/6 complex in maintaining genome stability.
Summary
     A recent study investigated the relationship between preserved communication abilities and healthy ageing in individuals aged 39-82 years. The researchers aimed to determine whether the age-typical loss of sensory acuity could be compensated for by an individual's preserved attentional neural filtering. They collected electroencephalographic and behavioural data from 105 participants over a two-year period.

     The study found that despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance remained stable over the two-year period. Additionally, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint, but not longitudinally. This suggests that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories.

     The researchers also aimed to replicate their previous findings that an individual's neural filtering ability impacts their listening performance independently of age or hearing status. However, when analysed in the longitudinal sample of ageing listeners, they did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain-behaviour links observed within each timepoint.

     The study characterised how hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance change across the middle to older adult lifespan. They used linear mixed-effect models to test cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes with time, and quantified each measure's test-retest reliability as their T1-T2 Pearson's correlation. The results showed that the previously observed age- and hearing-loss-independent effect of neural filtering on both accuracy and response speed was not longitudinally stable.

     Importantly, the study highlights the complexity of listening behaviour, which involves the orchestration of different perceptual and cognitive processes. The researchers focused on one candidate neurobiological implementation of an auditory attentional filter to help explain inter-individual differences in listening behaviour and its lifespan trajectories. Overall, the study raises caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour.
Summary
     Scientists have long known that animals use their sense of taste and smell to find nutritious food and avoid poisonous substances. However, the role of taste and smell in the use of medicinal plants is not well understood. A recent study aimed to investigate whether the taste and smell of medicinal plants could predict their therapeutic uses in ancient Greece and Rome. The researchers used a tasting panel to assess the taste and smell of various medicinal plants and applied statistical models to determine whether these qualities could predict their uses in ancient times.

     The study found that the taste and smell of medicinal plants were strongly associated with their therapeutic uses. Plants with simple yet intense tastes and smells were more likely to have multiple uses, and 21 out of 22 taste and smell qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. The researchers also found that certain tastes and smells, such as bitter, starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy, were associated with the use of medicinal plants. These findings suggest that the ancient Greeks and Romans may have used medicinal plants based on their observed physiological effects, which are consistent with modern understanding of taste and smell receptor pharmacology.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of the history of medicine. The theory of humours, which was the dominant medical theory in ancient Greece and Rome, posited that illness arose from an imbalance of bodily fluids. However, the study suggests that the use of medicinal plants may have been based on their observed physiological effects, rather than the humoral theory. The researchers propose that the taste and smell of medicinal plants may have linked the humoral theory to modern medicine, providing a connection between ancient and modern medical practices.

     The study demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods in understanding human behavior and the properties of plants. By analyzing the taste and smell of medicinal plants, the researchers were able to connect ancient therapeutic knowledge with modern science. The study's findings highlight the importance of chemosensation, the combination of taste and smell, in the use of medicinal plants and provide new insights into the history of medicine.
Summary
     Bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Salmonella, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri, are known to cause gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia, leading to sepsis and death in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. These bacteria have a tendency to enter the bloodstream, but the mechanisms behind this behavior are not well understood. Researchers have discovered that these bacteria are attracted to human serum, a component of blood, and use it as a source of nutrients for growth.

     The study found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the serum source. This response is mediated by chemotaxis, a process by which bacteria move towards a chemical stimulus, and the chemoreceptor Tsr, which recognizes the amino acid L-serine present in serum. The researchers obtained the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identified a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues.

     The study found that Tsr is widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. The researchers also found that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. This behavior is referred to as "bacterial vampirism," which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.

     The study suggests that L-serine functions as a molecular cue that directs Salmonella toward serum, but nutrients present in serum other than L-serine provide the major growth advantages. The researchers also found that the bacterial attraction response to serum is robust and rapid, with the motile population reorganizing within 1-2 minutes of serum exposure to be significantly biased toward the serum source. This response occurs through the cooperative action of multiple bacterial chemoreceptors that perceive several chemoattractant stimuli within serum, one of which is the chemoreceptor Tsr through recognition of L-serine.
Summary
     Scientists have long known that male germ cells, which produce sperm, share a common origin across different animal species. However, understanding the genetic program that defines their cellular identity has been challenging due to the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells and their widespread leaky transcription. A team of researchers used network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species to describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level.

     The study found that the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell corresponds to the expression of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. This scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis.

     By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, the researchers uncovered 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies.

     The study suggests that the transcriptional identity of metazoan male germ cells is built around a relatively small network of deeply conserved gene interactions with an overarching functional impact. Despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ and a preferential birthplace for new genes, deeply conserved genes remain central components in the male germ cell transcriptome of evolutionarily distant species.

     The researchers propose that the functional basis of metazoan male germ cell identity relies on an old, evolutionarily conserved genetic program that can provide relevant insight into spermatogenesis and human infertility. The study's findings significantly expand the breadth of previous observations in the mammalian lineage and provide a new understanding of the conserved molecular basis of metazoan spermatogenesis.
Biologists have long been fascinated by the way certain cells, called eukaryotes, move through their environment using whip-like structures called flagella. In the model organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two flagella beat in a synchronized, breaststroke-like motion to propel the cell forward. To steer, the cell fine-tunes the coordination of these flagella, but the exact mechanism behind this process has remained elusive.

    Researchers have proposed that one flagellum leads the beating, with its dynamic properties influencing the other flagellum. However, a new study has shed light on the roles of each flagellum in synchronous beating. The study used a non-invasive technique to selectively load each flagellum and found that the coordinated beating responds only to the load exerted on the cis flagellum. This asymmetry in response is due to a unilateral coupling between the two flagella.

    The researchers also discovered that the flagella have differential roles in coordination, with the cis flagellum playing a distinct role. This finding has implications for the tactic behaviors of biflagellates, which use their flagella to navigate their environment. The study's results were obtained through a combination of experiments, computations, and modeling efforts.

    The researchers used oscillatory flows to apply biased loads on one flagellum, allowing them to test the hypothesis that the flagella have differential roles in coordination. They developed a reduced stochastic model to simulate the system and found that the flagellar dominance and selective loading affect the coordinated flagellar beating. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to clarify the interplay between flows and flagella, reproducing all experimental observations.

    The study's findings provide new insights into the mechanisms behind flagellar coordination and have implications for our understanding of the tactic behaviors of biflagellates. The results highlight the importance of the cis flagellum in the coordination of flagellar beating and suggest that the flagella are coupled to external flow only through the cis flagellum.
summary
     Biomedical research has long sought to understand the benefits of intermittent fasting on metabolism. A recent study has shed light on the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon. The study found that intermittent fasting promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) in the intestine. This increase in IL-22 production leads to the "beigeing" of subcutaneous white adipose tissue, a process where white fat cells are converted into energy-burning brown fat cells.

     The study used adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s to increase beigeing of white adipose tissue in mice with diet-induced obesity. Exogenous IL-22 was also shown to increase beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Furthermore, the study found that a deficiency of the IL-22 receptor (IL-22R) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting.

     Single-cell sequencing of intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s. Analysis of cell-cell ligand receptor interactions suggested that intermittent fasting stimulates the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These findings establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue and suggest that the ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting.

     The study's results demonstrate that intestinal ILC3s are critical for the beigeing of white adipose tissue induced by intermittent fasting. This conclusion is supported by observations that intermittent fasting stimulates the secretion of IL-22 by intestinal ILC3s in both lean and obese mice. The study also found that IL-22R mediates the effect of intestinal ILC3s on beigeing of white adipocytes. Overall, the study reveals a novel pathway in the dialog between the gut and adipose tissue, providing new insights into the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting.

     Biologists have long studied how animals respond to threats, but most research has focused on a single defensive behavior: freezing. However, animals exhibit a range of responses to danger, including jumping, darting, and tail rattling. To better understand these complex behaviors, researchers designed a new experiment using mice to investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms contribute to defensive responses.

     In the study, mice were subjected to a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, where a tone and white noise stimulus was paired with a footshock. The researchers compared the responses of mice that received this paired stimulus with those that received unpaired or reversed presentations of the stimulus. The results showed that mice that received the paired stimulus exhibited robust freezing during the tone period and explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the white noise period. In contrast, mice that received unpaired or reversed presentations of the stimulus showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely exhibited jumping or darting.

     The researchers also observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during white noise to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the stimulus, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to white noise, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction.

     The findings suggest that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression. The study highlights the importance of considering both associative and non-associative mechanisms in understanding defensive behavior. The results also demonstrate the value of using a modified Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that elicits a range of defensive responses, including freezing, jumping, and darting. This approach provides a more comprehensive understanding of how animals respond to threats and can inform the development of new treatments for anxiety disorders.
Biologists have long been fascinated by how insects navigate their environment. To do this, they need to keep track of their direction. Previous research has shown that insects use a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure to encode their head direction. However, it was unclear whether this sinusoidal activity pattern is just a coincidence or if it provides a specific advantage. To address this question, researchers established the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and found that many circuits can perform this task with different activity patterns. Among these, the sinusoidal pattern is the most resilient to noise, but only when the neurons are connected in a sinusoidal pattern as well.

The researchers compared their predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the locust and fruit fly and found a strong agreement. They also demonstrated that the predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, which means that the neural connections do not need to be explicitly encoded in the insect's genetic program. Instead, they can develop during the insect's development.

The study suggests that the consistent presence of the eight-column organization of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance occurrence, but rather a result of basic evolutionary principles. The researchers also found that the position-integrating neurons in these insects have sinusoidal activation patterns, which is consistent with previous studies.

The study's findings have implications for our understanding of how insects navigate their environment. The researchers propose that the sinusoidal activity pattern is a common motif in insect navigation because it facilitates element-wise vector addition. However, they also found that other circuits with different encoding patterns can perform this task, suggesting that the sinusoidal pattern is not the only reason for its prevalence.

The study's predictions were compared with anatomical data from the desert locust and fruit fly, and a strong agreement was found. The researchers also demonstrated that the predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, which means that the neural connections do not need to be explicitly encoded in the insect's genetic program. Instead, they can develop during the insect's development. The study's findings provide new insights into the neural basis of insect navigation and have implications for our understanding of how animals navigate their environment.

     Biologists have long known that certain parasites can manipulate their hosts to increase their chances of being transmitted to new hosts. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these changes are not well understood. A recent study has shed light on how a protein produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, called SAP54, influences the behavior of leafhoppers, the insects that spread these parasites. The researchers found that SAP54 triggers a response in plants that makes them more attractive to female leafhoppers, but not male leafhoppers. This response is linked to the degradation of a plant protein called SVP, which is involved in plant development. The study suggests that SAP54 acts as a kind of "matchmaker" that helps male leafhoppers find mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. As a result, female leafhoppers prefer to lay their eggs on plants that have been exposed to male leafhoppers, which increases the chances of the parasites being transmitted to new hosts. The researchers also found that SAP54 suppresses the plant's biotic stress response, making it more vulnerable to leafhopper attacks. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between plants, insects, and parasites, and highlights the role of a single parasite gene in shaping the behavior of its insect vectors. The findings have important implications for our understanding of how parasites manipulate their hosts and how they are transmitted to new hosts. The study also opens up new avenues for research into the intersection of plant developmental processes and plant-insect interactions. The researchers propose a mechanism by which SAP54 targets a conserved host regulator, SVP, to attract female leafhopper vectors to produce more progeny on plants exposed to leafhopper males. This intricate interaction is detailed in a proposed mechanism. The study suggests that SAP54 promotes the abundance of phytoplasma-carrying insect vectors and facilitates phytoplasma transmission, illustrating how a bacterial gene extends its influence beyond its primary plant host to modulate the host choice and reproductive behavior of the insect vector.
Summary
     Candida albicans is a type of fungus that can cause infections in humans and is difficult to treat due to its ability to develop resistance to antifungal medications. Researchers used a new technique called DROP-seq to study how C. albicans responds to antifungal drugs at the single-cell level. They found that when exposed to the antifungal drug fluconazole, C. albicans cells split into two distinct subpopulations. One subpopulation, called the Ribo-dominant state, is characterized by increased production of ribosomes, which are essential for protein synthesis. The other subpopulation, called the Stress-dominant state, is enriched with genes related to stress responses.

     The researchers also found that the ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR) is activated in these subpopulations, which may help the cells survive the antifungal treatment. This study provides new insights into how C. albicans develops resistance to antifungal drugs and may lead to the development of new treatments. The researchers used a nanoliter droplet-based assay to profile the transcriptomes of thousands of individual C. albicans cells in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs over several days. This approach allowed them to identify distinct subpopulations of cells with different gene expression profiles.

     The study found that the expression of genes related to cell cycle stage, metabolism, and stress responses is heterogeneous in untreated C. albicans cells. When exposed to fluconazole, the cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: the Ribo-dominant state and the Stress-dominant state. The Ribo-dominant state is characterized by increased production of ribosomes, while the Stress-dominant state is enriched with genes related to stress responses. The ribosome assembly stress response (RASTR) is activated in these subpopulations, which may help the cells survive the antifungal treatment. This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of antifungal drug tolerance in C. albicans and may lead to the development of new treatments.
Summary
     The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution proposes that species vary in the effectiveness of selection. A new metric, the Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), has been developed to measure the effectiveness of selection at the molecular level. CAIS is based on Kullback-Leibler divergence and corrects for two confounders: GC content and amino acid composition. This new metric can be calculated from a single complete genome without requiring data on polymorphism, mutation rate, or demographic history.

     CAIS measures the proportion of sites at which codon adaptation is effective, indicating that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias. This metric is more direct than estimates of effective population size, which are based on neutral polymorphism. CAIS and another metric, the Effective Number of Codons (ENC), can be estimated for more species because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data. CAIS has the additional advantage of not being confounded with amino acid frequencies.

     The researchers chose vertebrates as a test case due to the abundance of suitable data and the limited evidence for codon adaptation found in past studies. They demonstrated the use of CAIS correlations and ENC to show that protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder. The degree of bias in synonymous codon usage driven by selective preference offers a more direct way to assess how effective selection is at the molecular level in a given species. CAIS can be estimated from a single genome, without requiring polymorphism or mutation rate data.

     The study proposes CAIS as a more direct measure of the effectiveness of selection than past metrics that compare codon bias across species, which are confounded by among-species variation in GC content and/or amino acid composition. CAIS can be used to quantify degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates, and its behavior among species with stronger codon adaptation remains to be seen.
Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that causes millions of deaths worldwide each year. It occurs when the body's response to an infection becomes uncontrolled and causes damage to multiple organ systems. Inflammation plays a key role in sepsis, and a molecule called extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been identified as an important mediator of this inflammatory response. ATP is released by both host cells and bacteria, and its role in sepsis has been the focus of recent research.

    A study investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. The researchers used genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli), a common cause of sepsis, to demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase, an enzyme located in the inner bacterial membrane. They also found that impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death.

    The study used a mouse model of abdominal sepsis to analyze the effects of bacterial ATP on the immune response. The researchers found that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, leading to reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. They also discovered that bacterial ATP is transported in outer membrane vesicles (OMV) throughout the body, where it upregulates genes that activate degranulation in neutrophils, potentially exacerbating sepsis severity.

    The study showed that E. coli, a frequent cause of abdominal sepsis, releases the highest amount of ATP compared to other bacteria. The researchers found that ATP release is dependent on ATP generation and that the mode of action of released bacterial ATP is limited to the immediate cellular vicinity. However, the role of ATP released by bacteria in non-colonized compartments, such as the abdominal cavity or blood, remains to be determined.

    The study provides new insights into the mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis. The findings suggest that bacterial ATP plays a significant role in suppressing local immune responses and potentially exacerbating sepsis severity. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of ATP in sepsis and to develop strategies to target this molecule in the treatment of sepsis.
Summary
     Biomedical research has shown that children who experience psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) are at a higher risk of developing psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders. A new study used data from 6,602 children to investigate the relationship between genetic and environmental factors, cognitive intelligence, and PLEs. The researchers found that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs were associated with lower genetic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower family and neighborhood socioeconomic status, and less supportive environments. The study also found that cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs.

     The researchers used a novel statistical method to examine the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs mediated by cognitive intelligence. They investigated the mediating role of cognitive intelligence within the impacts of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs, including cognitive phenotype polygenic scores, family and neighborhood socioeconomic status, and positive family and school environments.

     The study found that higher polygenic scores for cognitive capacity phenotypes were associated with higher intelligence, and lower polygenic scores were associated with lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs. The researchers also found that family and neighborhood socioeconomic status, as well as supportive environments, had a significant impact on cognitive intelligence and PLEs. The study suggests that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

     The study's findings have implications for policy and practice, highlighting the importance of addressing socioeconomic disparities and promoting supportive environments to reduce the risk of PLEs and other mental health problems in children. The study's use of large-scale longitudinal data and novel statistical methods provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between genetic and environmental factors, cognitive intelligence, and PLEs.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) in the development of the human brain. FGF8 is a protein that plays a crucial role in establishing the positional cues that guide the formation of different brain regions during fetal development. However, the exact mechanisms by which FGF8 influences brain development remain poorly understood.

     To investigate the effects of FGF8 on brain development, a team of scientists used human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to create cerebral organoids, three-dimensional structures that mimic the early stages of brain development. The researchers treated these organoids with FGF8 and analyzed the resulting changes in gene expression and cellular differentiation.

     The results showed that FGF8 treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, leading to the formation of distinct brain regions, including the telencephalon and mesencephalon. Within the telencephalon, FGF8 affected the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitor cells and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons. This, in turn, impacted the spontaneous activity of neuronal networks.

     Transcriptomic analysis revealed that FGF8 treatment induced the expression of ventral telencephalic genes, such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX3, while downregulating dorsal genes like EMX1, NEUROG2, SOX5, and LHX2. This suggests that FGF8 promotes ventral identity in the telencephalon.

     The study also found that FGF8 efficiently modulated genes associated with brain disorders, including NR2F1, which is linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. The researchers propose that FGF8-mediated modulation of key developmental genes guides the developmental trajectories of human brain cells along the dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes.

     Notably, the ability of FGF8 to modulate target genes varied depending on the regional identity of the exposed cells. The co-presence of various regional domains in FGF8-treated organoids, including dorsal and ventral telencephalon, diencephalic, and mesencephalic regions, represents a significant outcome of this study. Overall, the findings highlight the critical role of FGF8 in regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and its potential involvement in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development.
summary
     Biologists have long known that as animals mature, their sleep and feeding patterns become more organized and follow a daily rhythm. However, the cues that trigger this development in young animals are not well understood. A new study in the fruit fly Drosophila has shed light on this process, revealing that nutritional status plays a key role in the emergence of daily sleep-wake patterns in larvae.

     In the early stages of development, Drosophila larvae do not have a strong daily rhythm in their sleep and feeding behaviors. However, by the third instar larval stage (L3), their sleep and feeding patterns become more organized and follow a daily cycle. The researchers found that when mature larvae are forced to adopt the feeding strategies of younger larvae, their sleep-wake rhythms are disrupted, and they are unable to form long-term memories.

     The study also discovered that the development of the clock-arousal circuit, which is responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness, is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Specifically, the researchers found that the Dh44 neurons, which act as nutrient sensors, play a crucial role in detecting changes in the nutritional environment and driving the onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms.

     The researchers demonstrated that the Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive the onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. This suggests that changes in energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors. The findings of this study provide new insights into the development of daily rhythms in animals and have implications for our understanding of the relationship between nutrition and behavior.

     The study's results also suggest that the emergence of circadian sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae is advantageous, as it enables long-term memory capabilities at the L3 stage. The researchers propose that the cues that trigger the emergence of the DN1a-Dh44 circuit and the consolidation of sleep-wake rhythms in Drosophila larvae are related to changes in energetic demands during development.
Biologists have long observed that many animals, including fish, move in coordinated groups to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct measurements of the energy-saving benefits of this collective movement have been elusive. A recent study on giant danio fish (Devario aequipinnatus) sheds light on this phenomenon by characterizing both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of fish.

The researchers found that fish schools have a unique metabolism-speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at a speed of about one body length per second. This means that fish swimming in groups use less energy than solitary fish when moving at this speed. In fact, the study shows that fish schools can reduce their total energy expenditure by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When swimming at their maximum sustained speed, fish in schools also have a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and use 65% less non-aerobic energy than solitary individuals. This results in a significant reduction in total energy expenditure and cost of transport, with fish in schools using up to 53% less energy than solitary fish.

The study also found that fish in schools recover from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. This is likely due to the non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed. These savings can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance, which is beneficial for evading predators. The researchers suggest that these energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes.

The study used a high-drag viscous aquatic medium as a model to understand how group movement by animals can be more energy-efficient than movement by isolated individuals. By increasing maximum aerobic performance, fish schools save anaerobic energy and reduce the recovery time after peak swimming performance. The researchers expect that the need to conserve energy in animals moving against air or water resistance should be greater at higher speeds, and that fish in schools can reduce the total cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement.

The study directly measured both aerobic and non-aerobic energy used by schooling fish over a wide range of water velocities, and compared the swimming performance curve to that of solitary fish. The results show that both solitary fish and fish schools have a concave upward shaped aerobic metabolic rate-speed curve over the lower portion of their speed range. However, fish schools swimming at a speed of about one body length per second consume less energy than at slower speeds. Overall, the study provides new insights into the energy-saving benefits of collective movement in fish and highlights the importance of considering both aerobic and anaerobic energy contributions in understanding animal locomotion.
Summary
     Airway macrophages (AM) play a crucial role in preventing infection in the lungs and are a target for host-directed therapy. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung-resident AM. Researchers examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in their resting state and after priming with interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin-4 (IL-4) to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung.

     The study found that human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. However, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM, which shifted to a "Warburg"-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM, and blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ-driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis.

     Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. The study provides evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.
Summary
     For the first time, a study has shown that nocturnal bull ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon to navigate at night. This ability allows them to find their way home even when the sun is hidden by clouds, canopy, or the horizon. The moon's polarized light pattern is much dimmer than the sun's, but the ants can still detect it and use it as a compass cue.

     Nocturnal bull ants typically leave their nest at twilight and rely on the sun's polarized light pattern to navigate. However, when the sun is no longer visible, they use the moon's polarized light pattern to find their way home. The study found that the ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons when polarized light levels are at their lowest.

     The researchers rotated the overhead polarized light pattern above homing ants and observed that they altered their headings in response. This suggests that the ants are using the polarized moonlight to navigate. The study also found that the ants incorporate the moonlight pattern into their path integration system throughout the night, similar to how they incorporate the sun's polarized light pattern during the day.

     While it has been theorized that other nocturnal insects, such as bees and crickets, may also be able to detect polarized moonlight, this study provides the first behavioral evidence of its use in goal-directed navigation. The study's findings suggest that polarized moonlight is a detectable cue throughout the lunar month and is likely processed through the same visual pathways as polarized sunlight. This means that nocturnal bull ants can use the same underlying neural architecture for both polarized solar light and polarized moonlight cues.
Summary
     Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had a unique tail structure that played a crucial role in their flight control. Early pterosaurs had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. However, their tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that could compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. To maintain stiffness in the vane, early pterosaurs likely developed a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system.

     Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to examine the tail vanes of over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils. They found that four exceptional specimens exhibited well-preserved tail vanes, including one that was only visible under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence. The imaging revealed a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes, which supported the dynamic tensioning system. This system allowed the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure.

     The study suggests that the tail vanes of early pterosaurs were not just passive structures, but played an active role in flight control. The dynamic tensioning system would have helped to maintain stiffness in the vane, preventing it from fluttering excessively and compromising aerodynamic control. This finding provides new insights into the evolution of flight in pterosaurs and highlights the importance of the tail structure in their flight capabilities. The study also raises questions about the disappearance of tail vanes in later pterosaurs and their absence in modern birds and bats.
Summary
     Adolescence is a critical period of life marked by significant changes in behavior, social interactions, and decision-making. These changes are essential for transitioning into adulthood, but they also increase the risk of developing various psychiatric disorders. Research suggests that the reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence plays a key role in these behavioral changes and increased vulnerability.

     A recent study used fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to investigate differences in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core of adolescent and adult male rats. The study found baseline differences in dopamine release between adult and adolescent rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood.

     The study also revealed that the α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. Blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors showed that this effect is dependent on GABA tone. Using microdialysis, the researchers confirmed the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo.

     The findings suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence. This mechanism involves acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release. The study highlights the complex and reciprocal regulation of dopamine release by GABA and nAChRs, which may be age/developmental stage-dependent.

     The study focused on the NAc core, which has the largest difference in stimulated dopamine release between adult and adolescent male rats. The results provide new insights into the mechanisms driving age-related differences in dopamine release and may have implications for understanding the development of psychiatric disorders. The study's findings suggest that the α6 nAChR and GABA play a critical role in regulating dopamine release during adolescence, and that this regulation may be unique to this developmental stage.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long sought to understand the underlying causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a condition characterized by a range of behavioral traits. Despite the complexity of ASD, a recent study using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has made a significant breakthrough. The study found that individuals with two distinct subtypes of ASD, idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion, share common defects in neural precursor cell (NPC) development. These defects include reduced neurite outgrowth and migration, which are critical for proper brain development.

     The researchers used an unbiased phospho-proteome screen to identify signaling differences that may contribute to these developmental defects. To their surprise, they found that hundreds of shared phospho-peptides were identified between the two ASD subtypes, including the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. The study confirmed that mTOR signaling alterations were present in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes.

     The researchers then conducted gain and loss of function studies to determine whether mTOR dysregulation drives the developmental abnormalities in ASD. They found that increasing mTOR pathway activity in individuals with low mTOR levels could rescue ASD defects, while reducing mTOR pathway activity in individuals with high mTOR levels reproduced autism NPC phenotypes. This suggests that mTOR signaling dysregulation is a shared pathogenic mechanism across different ASD subtypes.

     The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of ASD. They suggest that despite the genetic heterogeneity of the disorder, there may be common underlying mechanisms that contribute to its development. The identification of mTOR signaling as a point of convergence for shared ASD phenotypes provides a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of ASD. The study's results also highlight the importance of early developmental dysregulation in the pathogenesis of ASD, which may be a common feature among multiple forms of the disorder.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long been interested in understanding how the brain processes sound. A key component of this process is the connection between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea. Recent studies have shown that these connections, called afferent synapses, are diverse in structure and function. This diversity is thought to contribute to the brain's ability to process different sounds, but the exact relationship between synaptic diversity and neural response diversity has been difficult to study.

     To investigate this relationship, a team of researchers used a technique called paired recordings to study the connections between IHCs and SGNs in mice. They found that synapses with high rates of spontaneous release (SR) were predominantly located on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more compact spontaneous electrical signals, lower voltage thresholds, and faster response times compared to synapses with low SR.

     The researchers also found that high SR synapses were more tightly coupled to calcium channels and vesicular release sites, which are essential for transmitting signals from IHCs to SGNs. These findings suggest that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.

     The study's results provide new insights into the mechanisms of sound processing in the brain and highlight the importance of synaptic diversity in the cochlea. The findings also underscore the challenges of studying the complex relationships between presynaptic hair cell function and neural sound encoding. Further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms of SGN firing diversity in the cochlea and how it contributes to our ability to process sound.
Summary
     The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, has a complex lifecycle that involves various stages, each with unique environmental challenges. To overcome these challenges, the parasite relies on tightly regulated access to chromatin for transcriptional regulation. Microrchidia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across different kingdoms, including plants and animals. Recent studies have highlighted the role of MORC proteins as transcriptional switches in apicomplexan parasites.

     A new study used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool, along with molecular and genomics approaches, to investigate the function of PfMORC in Plasmodium falciparum. The researchers found that PfMORC modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite's erythrocytic cycle. Moreover, PfMORC is essential for the parasite's survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments revealed that PfMORC binds to sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, suggesting a role in modulating stage transition.

     Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) studies showed that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite's heterochromatin structure, leading to its death. These findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, making it a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.

     The study aimed to determine the genome-wide distribution and exact function of PfMORC throughout the parasite's lifecycle. Immunoprecipitation of an HA-tagged parasite line validated the role of PfMORC in heterochromatin structure maintenance. The researchers also explored the association of PfMORC with chromatin accessibility and stage-specific gene regulation using ChIP-seq in duplicate at the ring, trophozoite, and schizont stages.

     The study used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to determine the nuclear localization, genome-wide distribution, and regulatory impacts of PfMORC on the parasite chromatin, transcriptome, and cell cycle development. The results demonstrate that PfMORC is not only critical for parasite cell cycle progression and survival but also has a direct role in heterochromatin formation and gene silencing, including regulating immune evasion through antigenic variation.
Summary
     Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, such as depression and anxiety. Researchers explored whether nerves that infiltrate tumors contribute to these changes by affecting brain function. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer, the study found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to specific areas of the brain and alter behaviors, including decreased nesting, increased latency to eat, and reduced wheel running.

     The study used a technique called neuronal tracing to map the connections between the tumor and the brain. The results showed that tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons, which are specialized nerve cells that detect pain, exhibited heightened activity. Brain regions receiving these neural projections also showed increased activity compared to non-tumor-bearing mice.

     The researchers found that eliminating these nociceptor neurons reduced brain activity and mitigated the behavioral changes caused by the tumor. However, analgesic treatment, which relieves pain, only partially restored normal behavior, suggesting that pain is not the sole driver of these changes.

     The study suggests that tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior. This connection occurs independently of pain and drives behavioral alterations in tumor-bearing mice. The elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons, which are involved in pain sensation, reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, but also highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients.

     The study's findings are significant because they demonstrate that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit that extends from the tumor bed to the brain. This circuit influences behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. The neural connection between the tumor and brain, together with the altered activity of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons, may contribute to the poor mental health experienced by cancer patients and survivors.

     The study's results have important implications for the development of targeted interventions to alleviate the mental health burdens associated with cancer. By understanding the interaction between the tumor, infiltrating nerves, and the brain, researchers may be able to develop new treatments to mitigate the negative effects of cancer on mental health.
Summary
     Scientists have studied the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact on the biophysical properties of the nucleocapsid protein. The nucleocapsid protein is a multifunctional protein that plays a crucial role in the virus's life cycle. The researchers used a large genomic database of SARS-CoV-2 to examine how mutations in the protein's amino acid sequence affect its biophysical properties.

     The study found that mutations in the protein's intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) can have a significant impact on its biophysical properties, including thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. The researchers also found that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal effects, meaning that changes in one part of the protein can affect other parts of the protein.

     The study focused on the Omicron variant of the virus and found that distant mutations in different IDRs can have compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties. The researchers also identified a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation.

     The study suggests that genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional N-protein species, particularly in the IDRs. The researchers used computational methods to evaluate the range of biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein folded domains and IDRs across the observed mutant spectrum.

     In complementary biophysical experiments, the researchers characterized the variation in thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, energetics of NA binding, assembly, and LLPS propensity of several representative N-protein mutants derived from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. The results show that a large biophysical parameter space is available for viable N-protein, with the potential for mutations to exert nonlocal effects modulating overall protein biophysical properties.

     The study highlights the importance of understanding the biophysical properties of viral proteins and how they contribute to the virus's evolutionary fitness. The researchers suggest that exploiting the emerging mutational landscape and sequence space presents both a challenge and an opportunity to explore the biophysical phenotype spectrum and uncover the salient functional principles of RNA-virus proteins.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of hibernating animals to survive the harsh winter months with minimal food and water intake. To better understand this phenomenon, researchers investigated the role of skeletal muscle myosin in hibernating mammals. Myosin is a protein that plays a crucial role in muscle contraction and energy production. The study aimed to determine whether myosin and its metabolic efficiency change during hibernation to optimize energy utilization.

The researchers isolated muscle fibers from small and large hibernating mammals, including ground squirrels and bears, and conducted experiments to measure myosin dynamics and ATP demand. The results showed that in larger hibernators, such as bears, myosin structure remained unchanged during hibernation. However, in smaller hibernators, like ground squirrels, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor led to increased energy expenditure in type II muscle fibers at room temperature.

To further investigate this finding, the researchers repeated the experiments at a lower temperature, closer to the body temperature of torpid animals. At this temperature, they found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, they observed hyper-phosphorylation of the myosin molecule in ground squirrels, which may help stabilize the myosin molecule and mitigate increases in energy expenditure during torpor.

The study suggests that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes in ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. The researchers also found that myosin is further altered in response to cold exposure, highlighting its potential role in skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis. These findings provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying hibernation and may have implications for the development of strategies to improve human muscle function and energy efficiency.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have long understood that chondrocyte columns, a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a crucial role in bone elongation. However, a new study reveals that the formation of these columns is not as straightforward as previously thought. By analyzing the 3D structure of cell clones in the growth plates of mouse embryos and postnatal mice, the researchers found that most cells do not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation. Instead, incomplete rotation of the division plane during cell division results in non-stereotypic cell stacking, leading to the formation of elongated clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction.

The study used a combination of 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis to examine hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in the growth plates of mouse embryos. The results showed that while embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction, rather than the expected columns. In postnatal mice, the researchers found both complex columns composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, as well as small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges of the growth plate.

The researchers also found that the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns correlated with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion. This suggests that clusters may promote expansion, while columns support elongation. The study's findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determine the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth.

The study provides new insights into the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development. The researchers used a modified version of 3D MAPs to analyze the 3D structure of cell clones in the growth plates of mouse embryos and postnatal mice. They found that uniclonal and multiclonal columns are rare in the embryonic growth plate, and that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation, namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation, is also rare in the embryonic growth plate. The study highlights the importance of 3D analysis when studying complex cellular arrangements, and provides a new understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying growth plate activity and bone elongation during development.
Summary
     Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are proteins that play a crucial role in the transport of peptides and drugs across cell membranes. These transporters are of great interest in the pharmaceutical industry due to their ability to improve the oral bioavailability of certain drugs. Researchers have used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and computer simulations to study the structure and function of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and SLC15A2.

     Recent studies have provided new insights into the conformational states of these transporters, but important questions remain about how protons and substrates are coupled during the transport process. To address this, researchers used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to map out the full conformational cycle of SLC15A2 and its thermodynamic driving forces. The simulations revealed a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive the inward-directed alternating access of the transporter.

     The study also identified key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which were validated experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Additionally, the researchers used constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations to establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition. This link is crucial for understanding secondary active transport in POTs.

     The study provides a detailed model of the alternating access mechanism of mammalian POTs, including how the movement of two protons drives conformational changes and how these changes are coupled to the presence of substrate. The researchers also found that the binding of substrate alone does not thermodynamically drive the transporter from one conformational state to another. Instead, the protonation state-dependent conformational changes play a crucial role in the transport process.

     The study's findings have important implications for the design of new drugs that target tissue and organ bioavailability. By understanding the mechanism of proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals, researchers can develop more effective treatments for a range of diseases. The study provides a vital step forward in integrating knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design.
summary
     Biomedical research has long suggested that neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization across the animal kingdom, including humans. This suppression is thought to increase sensitivity to auditory feedback, allowing for the detection of vocalization errors. However, a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring has remained elusive. To address this issue, researchers obtained intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production.

     The study first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across the superior temporal gyrus (STG). Next, the researchers performed a delayed auditory feedback (DAF) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. The results showed that overlapping sites in the STG exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback, with a strong correlation between the two measures. This supports the hypothesis that auditory suppression predicts sensitivity to speech errors in humans.

     The study also found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm. This suggests that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity. Furthermore, the researchers found a significant correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, indicating that suppression might be a key mechanism underlying speech monitoring.

     To test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression enables detection and correction of speech errors, the researchers predicted that suppressed auditory sites should be sensitive to auditory feedback and exhibit enhanced neural responses to feedback perturbations. The results supported this prediction, showing that overlapping sites in the STG exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to auditory feedback.

     The study used intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings in neurosurgical participants, which offers a high level of spatial detail and temporal precision. The researchers first identified the sites that show auditory suppression during speech production and then employed a DAF paradigm to test whether the same sites show sensitivity to perturbed feedback. The results provide evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and speech monitoring, suggesting that suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring.
Scientists have conducted a comprehensive study of McrBC systems, a common type of prokaryotic defense mechanism, and discovered a previously uncharacterized branch called coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoCoNuTs). These systems are found in diverse prokaryotes and have a wide range of genomic associations. CoCoNuTs are characterized by their extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases.

     The researchers identified three distinct types and multiple subtypes of CoCoNuTs, each with unique domain compositions and genomic associations. They found that all CoCoNuTs contain domains that can interact with translation system components, such as the SmpB-like OB-fold, Hsp70 homologs, and YTH domains, as well as RNases like HEPN. This suggests that at least one of the activities of these systems targets RNA.

     The study suggests that CoCoNuTs may employ an echeloned defense strategy, similar to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems. This involves launching an immune response to eliminate viral DNA and/or RNA, but if this fails, an abortive infection response leading to programmed cell death or dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.

     The researchers also found that CoCoNuTs are often associated with other restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III. In many cases, these systems are encoded in the same predicted superoperons, and CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides or RNA fragments with cyclic termini that bind associated CARF domains.

     The study provides evidence that CoCoNuTs may target both DNA and RNA. The presence of McrC nuclease homologs in some CoCoNuTs suggests that they may target DNA, while the presence of HEPN RNases in other CoCoNuTs suggests that they may target RNA. The researchers suspect that RNA targeting is an ancestral feature of the CoCoNuT systems.

     The study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of prokaryotic defense mechanisms and the evolution of CRISPR-Cas systems. The discovery of CoCoNuTs and their complex interactions with other restriction systems highlights the diversity and adaptability of prokaryotic defense strategies.
Summary
     Calcineurin is a protein phosphatase that plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, calcineurin is involved in regulating the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP), which is essential for the worm's intestinal function. Research has shown that inhibiting calcineurin leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection.

     Interestingly, the study found that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The researchers also discovered that the TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition. Furthermore, the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan.

     Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, which activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin. The rhythmic DMP cycle in C. elegans is known to be regulated by rhythmic calcium waves. The study's findings suggest that calcineurin plays a critical role in the C. elegans DMP and provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension.

     The researchers also examined the effect of calcineurin inhibition on C. elegans innate immunity. Surprisingly, they found that the knockdown of tax-6, the catalytic subunit of calcineurin, enhanced the susceptibility of C. elegans to bacterial infection despite enhancing lifespan. This suggests that the relationship between lifespan and innate immunity is complex and remains to be fully understood.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of calcineurin in regulating the C. elegans DMP and its impact on lifespan and innate immunity. The findings have implications for understanding the complex interplay between these processes and may shed light on the development of new therapeutic strategies for age-related diseases.
Biomedical researchers investigated how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory input or internal representations, and it is unclear how a limited set of cognitive control processes can effectively address diverse conflicts. The cognitive space theory proposes that different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions.

The researchers designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized to test the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation. They hypothesized that different types of conflicts are represented as points in a cognitive space, with the distance between the points reflecting the geometry of the cognitive space and scaling with the difference in the sources of the conflicts. The dimensions in the cognitive space of conflicts can be the aforementioned domains, in which domain-specific cognitive control processes are defined.

For a specific type of conflict, its location in the cognitive space can be parameterized using a limited number of coordinates, which reflect how much control is needed for each of the domain-specific cognitive control processes. The cognitive space can also represent different types of conflicts with low dimensionality. The researchers further hypothesized that the cognitive space representing different types of conflicts may be located in the frontoparietal network due to its essential roles in conflict resolution.

Two solutions to resolving different conflict types were proposed, differing based on whether the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. The domain-general cognitive control theories posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can thus flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts. This is supported by the generalizable control adjustment, which suggests that the frontoparietal cortex can adjust control strategies based on task demands.

The researchers tested these hypotheses using a task with five types of conflicts and found that both human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, thus suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts. The results provide evidence for the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation and suggest that the frontoparietal network is involved in conflict resolution.
Scientists have been trying to predict when a woman will give birth too early, a condition known as preterm birth. Preterm birth is the leading cause of illness and death in newborn babies worldwide. Most early births happen without warning and are caused by the mother's body going into labor too soon or her water breaking too early. To better understand why this happens, researchers studied the immune system in the vagina of pregnant women who were at high risk of preterm birth. They collected vaginal swabs from these women at different stages of pregnancy and measured the levels of various immune molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. The researchers found that the vaginal immune system in women who had a preterm birth was different from those who carried their babies to full term. Specifically, the vaginal immune system in women who had a preterm birth was more likely to be in a state of inflammation, which is the body's natural response to infection or injury. This inflammation was characterized by the presence of certain immune molecules that attract immune cells, such as monocytes and T-cells, and reduce the production of antimicrobial proteins and peptides. The researchers also found that the vaginal immune system undergoes changes throughout pregnancy, and deviations from these changes are associated with preterm birth. The study suggests that the vaginal immune system could be used as a potential biomarker to predict early preterm birth, which is a subset of preterm birth associated with severe health problems in newborns. The study's findings provide new insights into the causes of preterm birth and highlight the importance of the vaginal immune system in maintaining a healthy pregnancy. The research was conducted by the Perinatology Research Branch of the National Institutes of Health and was supported by the Wayne State University Perinatal Initiative in Maternal, Perinatal and Child Health. The study analyzed vaginal swabs from 739 women and 2,819 samples, making it the largest and most comprehensive study of its kind. The results show that the vaginal immune system has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk of early preterm birth. The study's findings have important implications for the development of new strategies to prevent preterm birth and improve the health outcomes of newborns.
Scientists have developed a new computer model, called the Hernandez-Hernandez model, to understand how the cells lining the walls of blood vessels in mammals control blood flow and blood pressure. These cells, called smooth muscle cells, play a crucial role in regulating the diameter of blood vessels to control blood pressure. The model is based on new experimental data that shows sex-specific differences in how male and female blood vessels respond to changes in blood pressure.

The model suggests that a type of potassium channel, called KV1.5, is the main controller of the electrical activity in male blood vessels. However, in female blood vessels, a different type of potassium channel, called KV2.1, plays a more significant role in controlling electrical activity. The model also predicts that female blood vessels are more sensitive to certain medications that block calcium channels, which are used to treat high blood pressure.

The researchers used computer simulations to test the model and found that it accurately predicted the behavior of male and female blood vessels. They also created a simplified model of a blood vessel to see how the medications would affect blood pressure in both males and females. The results showed that the medications were more effective in reducing blood pressure in female blood vessels than in male blood vessels.

The Hernandez-Hernandez model is the first to integrate sex-specific differences in the electrical activity of blood vessels into a comprehensive model. It provides new insights into how blood vessels respond to changes in blood pressure and how medications affect blood pressure in males and females. The model can be used to investigate the potential sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs, which could lead to more effective treatments for high blood pressure.

The model is based on data from mouse arteries, but the researchers note that mouse arteries share many similarities with human arteries. The study highlights the importance of considering sex-specific differences in the treatment of high blood pressure, as medications may have different effects on males and females. The Hernandez-Hernandez model provides a new framework for understanding the complex interactions between blood vessels, blood pressure, and medications, and it has the potential to improve the treatment of high blood pressure in both males and females.
Summary
     Biologists investigated how climate affects the decomposition of plant litter in different environments. They tested the idea that larger decomposers, such as insects and small animals, can counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, like microorganisms, to maintain similar decomposition rates across different climates. To do this, they placed baskets of plant litter with different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, ranging from very dry to very wet. They also used pitfall traps to capture and study the decomposers in these sites.

     The researchers found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. In the winter, microbial decomposition increased with precipitation, while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient, except in the driest sites. Macro-decomposers, such as insects and small animals, were more abundant and diverse in arid environments.

     The study suggests that macro-decomposition plays a crucial role in arid lands, possibly resolving a long-standing puzzle in the field of decomposition research. The findings highlight the importance of considering the size of decomposers when investigating how climate affects decomposition processes. The study's results have implications for understanding how ecosystems function in different environments and how they respond to changes in climate.

     The researchers used a novel approach to study decomposition by examining the climate dependency of plant litter decomposition by microorganisms, meso-decomposers, and macro-decomposers along a sharp aridity gradient. They found that the opposing climatic dependencies of micro- and macro-decomposers led to similar or even higher annual decomposition rates in arid sites compared to those measured in more mesic sites.

     The study's findings support a long-suggested but largely overlooked hypothesis that macro-decomposition governs plant litter decomposition in deserts. The results have important implications for understanding how ecosystems function in different environments and how they respond to changes in climate. The study highlights the need to consider the size of decomposers when investigating zoogeochemical processes.
Biomedical researchers have made a significant discovery about pancreatic cancer, a disease with a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. They found that a protein called CYRI-B plays a crucial role in the growth and spread of pancreatic cancer cells. In a mouse model of the disease, deleting the gene that encodes CYRI-B led to faster tumor growth and an increased risk of metastasis, or the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. However, as the disease progressed, the loss of CYRI-B actually slowed down the spread of cancer cells.

The researchers discovered that CYRI-B helps to regulate a process called macropinocytosis, which is a way that cells take in nutrients and other substances from their surroundings. They found that CYRI-B is highly expressed in human pancreatic cancers and is associated with poorer survival rates. In mice with pancreatic cancer, CYRI-B was also highly expressed and was found to be localized to structures called macropinosomes, which are involved in the internalization of nutrients and other substances.

The study suggests that CYRI-B acts as a buffer that helps to regulate the activity of a protein called RAC1, which is involved in cell migration and proliferation. When CYRI-B is present, it helps to keep RAC1 activity in check, preventing excessive cell growth and migration. However, when CYRI-B is lost, RAC1 activity increases, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and migration.

The researchers also found that CYRI-B is involved in the trafficking of signaling receptors, which are proteins that help cells respond to their environment. In pancreatic cancer cells, CYRI-B helps to regulate the internalization of a receptor called lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1, which is involved in the spread of cancer cells. When CYRI-B is lost, the internalization of this receptor is impaired, leading to reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a substance that promotes the spread of cancer cells.

Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of CYRI-B in pancreatic cancer and suggests that it may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of this disease. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to explore the potential of CYRI-B as a therapeutic target.
Summary
     Scientists have been studying human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), which are remnants of ancient viruses that inserted themselves into the human genome millions of years ago. One type of HERV, called HML-2, is particularly interesting because it has many intact or nearly intact proviruses, but none have been found to be replication-competent in humans. However, HML-2-related proviruses have been found in other primates, including rhesus macaques.

     Researchers have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. These proviruses show signs of recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques, such as intact open reading frames and insertional polymorphism. One clade of proviruses, characterized by a 750-base pair sequence between the env gene and the 3' long terminal repeat (LTR), is found in Old World monkeys but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split.

     The researchers also found similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons, which cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, indicating interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in the U3 region, which disrupt the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. However, the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating the ancestral Rec-RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.

     The study suggests that rhesus macaques may harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses, which could serve as a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time and as a model for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis. The researchers characterized a clade of ERVs in rhesus macaques that may provide insights into the evolution and activity of HML-2 viruses.
Summary
     Wound infections are a significant problem that can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing serious health issues and economic burdens. Enterococcus faecalis is a common bacteria found in persistent non-healing wounds, but its role in chronic wounds is not well understood. To investigate this, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model. They analyzed over 23,000 cells and created a comprehensive atlas of the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds.

     The study found unique transcriptional and metabolic changes in infected wounds, revealing distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal wound healing. The researchers identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faecalis infection triggered a premature and incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, E. faecalis infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization, inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in the scRNA-seq atlas.

     The study also discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways and promotes anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections. The study suggests that E. faecalis induces immunosuppression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, delaying the immune response. The researchers generated a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the host response to persistent E. faecalis wound infection, providing a foundation for future studies aimed at investigating bacterial factors contributing to wound pathogenesis and understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with delayed healing.

     The study compared the transcriptomic and cellular communication profiles between uninfected and E. faecalis-infected full-thickness mouse skin wounds at 4 days post-infection. However, the study lacked a reference dataset of uninfected, unwounded dorsal skin transcriptome, which would have allowed the researchers to investigate transcriptomic changes temporally, especially induced by the wounding alone. The study reaffirmed the known functions of fibroblasts during uninfected wound healing, consistent with the outcomes of predicted ligand-receptor interactions. Immune cells play a crucial role in wound healing by eliminating pathogens, promoting keratinocyte and fibroblast activity, and resolving inflammation and tissue repair.
Summary
     When plants are attacked by herbivores, they release chemicals into the air that can warn neighboring plants of potential danger. These chemicals, called volatiles, can trigger a defense response in nearby plants, making them more resistant to herbivores. However, the timing of this response is not well understood. A recent study used a specialized mass spectrometry system to track the release of volatiles from herbivore-attacked maize plants and the response of neighboring plants over time.

     The study found that when maize plants are exposed to volatiles from herbivore-attacked neighbors, they start to release terpenes, a type of chemical defense, within 24 hours. However, the release of terpenes is not immediate. Instead, it occurs in a delayed burst on the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not due to the accumulation of terpenes during the night, but rather coincides with the accumulation of jasmonate, a hormone involved in plant defense.

     The study suggests that the delayed burst is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. This means that the initial exposure to volatiles primes the plant to respond more strongly to the same volatiles the next day. The study also found that the delayed burst occurs independently of day-night light transitions and is not fully explained by the dynamics of the sender plant's volatiles.

     The study's findings have important implications for our understanding of how plants communicate with each other and defend against herbivores. The authors propose that the delayed response to volatiles may be an adaptive strategy that allows plants to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure by responding more strongly to volatile cues on the second day. This study provides new insights into the complex interactions between plants and their environment, and highlights the importance of considering the temporal dynamics of plant defense responses.
Summary
     Biologists have long wondered how humans developed the ability to create complex sentences and songs. One key feature of human language is recursion, where a vocal signal can be placed inside another of a similar kind. However, there is no evidence of this ability in nonhuman primates, suggesting it may be unique to humans. A recent study found that wild orangutans exhibit a similar recursive pattern in their vocalizations, specifically in the long calls of flanged male orangutans. These calls feature rhythmically isochronous sequences nested within isochronous sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata. The study suggests that these recursive structures were not the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures or anatomical artifacts, but rather a unique feature of hominid vocal combinatorics.

     The discovery of recursive vocal combinatorics in orangutans raises the possibility that this ability may have originated in proto-musical expression in human ancestors, rather than in language itself. This idea is supported by the fact that the recursive patterns found in orangutan calls are not related to syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. The study's findings open up new avenues for research on the evolution of recursion in humans, particularly in the context of primate vocal behaviors.

     The study's authors propose a novel approach to understanding recursive vocal combinatorics in wild primates, which involves a structural analysis of vocal patterns. This approach allows for the identification of potentially untapped signal diversity in nature and unrecognized combinatoric possibilities within the human clade. The study provides evidence for recursive self-embedded vocal patterning in a nonhuman great ape, offering a new charter for possible incipient and transitional states of recursion among hominids.

     The findings of this study have significant implications for our understanding of the evolution of human language and the origins of recursion. They suggest that recursive vocal combinatorics may have been a feature of ancient hominids, and that it may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans. Further research on primate vocal combinatorics, particularly in the wild, is needed to test this idea and shed more light on the evolution of human language.
cientists have long been fascinated by the constant battle between viruses and their hosts. In this ongoing struggle, viruses and hosts have evolved numerous strategies to outsmart each other. One key aspect of this arms race is the interaction between viral receptors and host cells. Viral receptors are proteins on the surface of host cells that viruses exploit to initiate infection. A recent study has shed light on the relationship between the MDA5 receptor and a type of virus called 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish called Miichthys miiuy.

The study found that MDA5, a protein similar to RIG-I, can recognize and respond to 5’ppp-RNA viruses in the absence of RIG-I. RIG-I is a protein that normally recognizes and responds to 5’ppp-RNA viruses, but it has been lost in many vertebrates during evolution. The researchers suggest that MDA5 may have taken over RIG-I's role in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA viruses, leading to the loss of RIG-I from the species genome.

The study also discovered that the 5’ppp-RNA virus can use a mechanism called m6A methylation to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability. This allows the virus to replicate and evade the host's immune system. The researchers propose that this is an example of an adversarial strategy used by the virus to outcompete the host's immune system.

The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex relationship between viruses and their hosts. They suggest that the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates may not be a random event, but rather a result of the evolution of alternative immune strategies, such as the one used by MDA5. The study also highlights the dynamic and ongoing nature of the arms race between viruses and their hosts, with each side constantly evolving new strategies to outsmart the other.

The study's results have implications for our understanding of the diversity of the immune system and the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to it. The findings also provide a new perspective on the loss of RIG-I in vertebrates and may have implications for the development of new antiviral therapies.
A recent study investigated the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition in men with non-metastatic prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). The study found that FSH levels were associated with changes in fat body mass (FBM) and lean body mass (LBM) after 12 months of ADT. Specifically, higher FSH levels were linked to increased fat mass in the arms, trunk, and total body, as well as a lower appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio. This suggests that FSH may play a role in the changes in body composition that occur during ADT.

The study involved 29 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer who received the LHRH antagonist degarelix, which is used to achieve long-term medical castration without the risk of testosterone surge. Body composition was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were also assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

At baseline, a weak, non-significant relationship was found between FSH levels and FBM in the arms and legs. However, after 12 months of ADT, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH levels and total FBM, fat mass in the arms and trunk, and a lower appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio. These findings suggest that FSH may be a potential marker for monitoring the risk of sarcopenic obesity in men undergoing ADT.

The study's results are consistent with previous research showing that FSH levels are associated with increased body weight and visceral adiposity in postmenopausal women. The study's limitations include its small sample size and the fact that it is an ancillary study of a prospective trial. Therefore, the results should be considered hypothesis-generating and require further investigation. Nevertheless, the study provides new insights into the relationship between FSH levels and body composition in men with prostate cancer undergoing ADT.
Summary
     Sudden cardiac death (SCD) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Researchers have been exploring new targets to prevent SCD, focusing on the sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2) Ca2+ release channels, which are downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels. Recent evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s contribute to the pathophysiology of SCD.

     A study used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic heart failure (HF), including a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. The researchers tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition would reduce sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigate VT/VF/SCD, and improve contractile function.

     The study found that treatment with dantrolene, a RyR2 inhibitor, prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, dantrolene lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. The study suggests that inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD.

     The study also found that the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD. The study highlights the need to identify new antiarrhythmic targets and develop new therapies for SCD, and suggests that RyR2 inhibition may be a promising approach.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family of proteins, which includes the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, plays a crucial role in regulating various cellular processes. However, the specific genes that respond to these proteins have not been well characterized. In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates body size through a signaling cascade involving the Smad protein SMA-3 and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri.

     Researchers used a combination of genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify the target genes of SMA-3 and SMA-9 in C. elegans larvae. They found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3 acting as a transcriptional activator and SMA-9 regulating both activated and repressed genes.

     The study revealed that SMA-9 has a previously unappreciated role in regulating genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppressed the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors. The findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that regulate the secretion of extracellular components, such as collagen, into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation.

     The study also found that SMA-9 has Smad-independent roles in regulating genes involved in immunity, which is consistent with the role of vertebrate Schnurri homologs in immunity. The researchers used a novel software analysis pipeline to integrate the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, which allowed them to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnurri transcription factors in the developing C. elegans larva.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex regulatory interactions between Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri, and highlights the importance of these proteins in regulating various cellular processes, including body size and immunity. The findings have implications for our understanding of the TGF-β signaling pathway and its role in development and disease.
Summary
     A recent study has identified the embryonic transcription factor DUX4 as a common feature of metastatic tumors in several types of cancer, including bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers. The researchers found that around 10-50% of advanced tumors in these cancer types expressed DUX4, a protein that suppresses interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation, making it harder for the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. In a large cohort of patients with urothelial carcinoma, a type of bladder cancer, the study found that DUX4 expression was significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and a reduced response to PD-L1 blockade, a type of immunotherapy. PD-L1 blockade is a treatment that blocks a protein on cancer cells that helps them evade the immune system. The study also found that DUX4 expression was a significant predictor of survival, with patients whose tumors expressed DUX4 having a median reduction in survival of over 1 year.

     The researchers verified that DUX4 expression in urothelial carcinoma tumors was associated with an immune-excluded or immune-desert phenotype, meaning that the tumors had fewer immune cells present. They also found that DUX4 expression was correlated with lower levels of PD-L1 in the tumor and immune compartments. The study suggests that DUX4 expression in metastatic cancers induces an immunosuppressive gene expression program, making it harder for the immune system to attack the cancer. The researchers propose that DUX4 could be a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.

     The study found that urothelial cancers had one of the highest frequencies of DUX4 expression among the five metastatic cancer cohorts analyzed, suggesting that DUX4 may be particularly important in this type of cancer. The researchers also demonstrated that the high rates of DUX4 expression observed in metastatic cancers were not due to technical biases and were consistent with expression of a polyadenylated DUX4 transcript in both primary and metastatic cancers. Overall, the study provides new insights into the role of DUX4 in metastatic cancers and highlights its potential as a target for developing new treatments for cancer.
Summary
     Livestock abortion is a significant issue affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. Despite its importance, there is a lack of data on the causes of livestock abortion, which hinders effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health. A study conducted in Tanzania aimed to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. The research team established a surveillance platform to collect data on abortion events reported by farmers to livestock field officers. Between 2017 and 2019, 215 abortion events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated, with attribution achieved for 19.5% of cases. The study found that delays in obtaining samples significantly affected attribution, and histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection.

     The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through community-based field officers, practical sample collection, and molecular diagnostic platforms. The findings suggest that livestock abortion surveillance can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses, and identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. The study also showed that an effective reporting and investigation system can be operationalized across a range of settings in Tanzania, including remote rural areas.

     The study highlights the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for both syndromic and event-based surveillance. The findings have implications for establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa. The study suggests that non-infectious conditions, such as nutritional, metabolic, and toxic conditions, may also contribute to livestock abortions in Tanzania, and that recent stressful events, including drought and wild predator attacks, may play a role in unattributed abortion cases. The study's results provide valuable insights into the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in Africa and highlight the need for further research in this area.
Summary
     Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for developing various diseases, including colon cancer. Nicotine, the major constituent of cigarette smoke, has been shown to increase the abundance and proliferative activity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in mice. This study demonstrates that nicotine activates the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and protein kinase C (PKC), leading to the activation of Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs. This effect was not observed in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine (DBZ) nullified the effects of nicotine on ISCs.

     The study found that nicotine enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after the loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, and DBZ inhibited nicotine-induced tumor growth. These findings suggest that nicotine triggers a pathway that regulates the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs. The study proposes that blocking the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling pathways may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating colon cancers.

     The study's results are consistent with the idea that extrinsic factors, such as nicotine, can increase the risk of cancer by promoting stem cell division. Nicotine was found to increase the abundance and proliferation of ISCs, which may partly explain the increased rate of intestinal tumors in smokers. The study suggests that targeting the α7-nAChR, Hippo-YAP/TAZ, and Notch signaling pathways may be effective in treating nicotine-induced colon cancer.

     The study provides new insights into the pathway by which stem cells respond to nicotine, a major component of cigarette smoke, and suggests an effective new strategy for the treatment of smoking-related colon cancer. The findings also highlight the importance of understanding the crosstalk between Hippo, Notch, and Wnt signaling in regulating mammalian intestinal homeostasis.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that a cellular system called Hsp70 plays a crucial role in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, which can lead to stress, aging, and disease. Hsp70 works by binding to misfolded proteins and helping to refold them into their correct shape. However, this process requires the help of other proteins called co-chaperones, specifically J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs).

     A recent study has shed light on how Hsp110, a type of NEF, interacts with Hsp70 and JDPs to facilitate protein disaggregation. The researchers found that Hsp110 plays a key role in the initial stages of disaggregation, helping to recruit Hsp70 to the surface of aggregates and modifying them into smaller species that are more easily processed by chaperones.

     The study also showed that the effectiveness of Hsp110 depends on the type of JDP it interacts with. Class B JDPs are more effective at stimulating Hsp70 activity than class A JDPs. Furthermore, the researchers discovered that Hsp110 disrupts the interaction between JDPs and Hsp70, which can improve disaggregation but also lead to inhibition at high concentrations of Hsp110.

     The study suggests that the balance between Hsp110, JDPs, and Hsp70 is critical for unlocking the full potential of the Hsp70 chaperone system. The researchers found that Hsp110's substrate-binding activity is not necessary to increase the binding of JDPs to aggregates, and that the effective concentration of Hsp110 is negatively correlated with its affinity for Hsp70.

     Overall, the study provides new insights into the complex interactions between Hsp110, JDPs, and Hsp70, and highlights the importance of a balanced interplay between these co-chaperones for efficient protein disaggregation. The findings have implications for our understanding of protein misfolding diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat these conditions.
Biomedical researchers have long used gait analysis to diagnose and monitor musculoskeletal conditions, such as knee arthropathy. However, traditional gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation, which can be limited by the need for expensive equipment, large facilities, and highly trained staff. To address these challenges, scientists have turned to wearable digital insoles, which are relatively low-cost and can provide objective gait analysis. A recent study demonstrated that a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures can yield similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard. The researchers constructed a machine learning model trained on force plate data collected from participants with knee arthropathy and controls. The model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set and a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects. The study showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics. This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods and supports the development of at-home gait assessments, which could improve the ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring. The researchers also found that a support vector machine (SVM) model trained on force plate data performed well on digital insole data, suggesting that digital insoles can measure vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) similarly to force plates. The study's findings have implications for the clinical application of wearable digital insoles for gait analysis in knee osteoarthritis, which is currently limited by a lack of analytical validation data. The results suggest that digital insoles could provide a more comprehensive assessment of gait, enabling a more accurate diagnosis and monitoring of musculoskeletal conditions.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have been searching for effective non-opioid treatments for post-surgical pain, which can cause significant suffering and lead to severe side effects from opioid analgesics. A recent study investigated the potential of a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, Clarix Flo (FLO), as a non-opioid therapy for managing post-surgical pain. The study found that local application of FLO attenuated established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity in mice without causing the known side effects of opioid use.

     The researchers isolated the major matrix component of FLO, called heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 (HC-HA/PTX3), which has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. They found that HC-HA/PTX3 replicated the pain-inhibiting effects of FLO, suggesting that it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Further investigation revealed that HC-HA/PTX3 induces cytoskeleton rearrangements in nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, leading to inhibition of sodium and calcium currents.

     The study used cultured DRG neurons to examine the receptor mechanisms and signaling pathways involved in neuron inhibition by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. The results showed that HC-HA/PTX3 selectively reduced the activation of small-diameter DRG neurons, which are mostly nociceptive neurons, in response to noxious heat stimulation. The researchers also found that HC-HA/PTX3 may attenuate the activation of key receptors involved in pain control, such as TRPV1, TRPA1, and MrgprD, and fundamentally decreases nociceptor excitability by inducing membrane hyperpolarization and altering intrinsic membrane properties.

     CD44, a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein, was found to be involved in the pain-inhibiting effects of HC-HA/PTX3. The study suggests that naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues, such as FLO and HC-HA/PTX3, may be effective non-opioid treatments for post-surgical pain. The underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3 have been unraveled, providing new insights into the development of non-opioid therapies for managing post-surgical pain.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long been interested in understanding the relationship between the color of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and their function. RPE cells play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the retina, and their pigmentation is often used as an indicator of their maturity and functionality. However, a recent study suggests that the color of RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their function.

     The study used human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells (iPSC-RPE) to investigate the relationship between cell color and gene expression. The researchers used a novel system called Automated Live Imaging and Cell Picking System (ALPS) to photograph and analyze the gene expression of individual cells. The results showed that the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells did not correlate with specific gene expression profiles.

     To further investigate this finding, the researchers re-analyzed the transcriptome of the iPSC-RPE cells and calculated the weighted sum of the RGB channels as a proxy for pigmentation level. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, and there is a time-lag between mRNA expression, production of enzymes, and synthesis of melanin.

     The study also found that gene sets related to retinoid recycling, an important feature of RPE cells, showed weak correlation with the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells. This suggests that the color of RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functional maturation. In fact, several lines of evidence suggest that in vitro pigmentation of stem cell-derived RPE cells may not necessarily reflect their levels of functional maturation.

     For example, bone marrow-derived RPE cells that are poorly pigmented in vitro become highly pigmented when transplanted, and iPSC-RPE cells that are not pigmented when prepared become heavily pigmented after engraftment. These findings suggest that the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition and not a strong indicator of their functional characteristics. The study's results have important implications for the development of RPE cells for regenerative medicine and highlight the need for further research into the relationship between RPE cell color and function.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers have long recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain a deeper understanding of ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset, a small, prosocial primate closely related to humans, has emerged as a promising model organism for such studies. However, traditional research methods often fail to capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this limitation, scientists have developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MarmoAAP), a novel behavioral apparatus designed to study cooperative behaviors in common marmosets.

     MarmoAAP enables high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. The apparatus is highly modular and adaptable, accommodating a wide range of behaviors and individual animal capabilities. Furthermore, MarmoAAP provides a platform to investigate the neural activity underlying naturalistic social behaviors. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism.

     The MarmoAAP apparatus and associated automated cooperative pulling paradigm have the potential to make a significant contribution to the study of marmoset social behaviors. The combination of high-resolution behavioral data and integration with neural recordings positions the paradigm as a robust and versatile tool for unraveling the complexities of primate behavior. By incorporating behavioral metrics from video and audio recordings with the timing of marmosets' pulling behaviors and reward delivery, researchers can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between behavior, vocal communication, and cooperative interactions in this species.

     MarmoAAP significantly increases the number of trials available for analysis, ensuring ample statistical power when investigating the relationship between neural activity and behaviors. The apparatus and associated behavioral paradigms create an avenue for simultaneous neural recordings while freely moving marmosets are engaged in tasks implemented by MarmoAAP. This innovation has the potential to advance our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes, ultimately contributing to the development of more effective treatments for neurological and psychiatric disorders.
Summary
     A recent study investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) on the developing offspring's genome regulation. The researchers used a mouse model that mimics common patterns of alcohol consumption during pregnancy in humans. They found that early moderate PAE affected DNA methylation in newborn pups, but did not alter behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed that the effects of PAE on DNA methylation were mostly tissue-specific, with some changes occurring as early as gastrulation. The study also found that DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential, suggesting broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation.

     The researchers replicated their findings in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and found that some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. A maternal diet high in folate and choline was found to protect against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation in the mouse model.

     The study used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to assess CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver, two target organs affected by ethanol. The exposure period covered the equivalent of pre-conception up until the first trimester in humans, reflecting a typical situation in which women may consume alcohol up until pregnancy recognition. The primary outcome of the study was differences in offspring DNA methylation, and secondary outcomes included behavioral deficits across neurodevelopmental domains relevant to FASD.

     The researchers also conducted a validation study using DNA methylation array data from 147 newborn buccal swabs from the Asking Questions About Alcohol in Pregnancy (AQUA) cohort. They found no evidence of differential DNA methylation at specific CpG sites that corresponded to mouse differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The study suggests that early moderate PAE can affect fetal genome regulation, even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes, and highlights the potential role of preventative maternal dietary interventions.
Summary
     Biologists have long believed that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) can silence a wide variety of genes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. However, researchers have found that the loss of certain regulators of RNA interference (RNAi) can selectively impair the silencing of some genes. A new study reveals that this selective requirement can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism.

     The study found that three proteins, RDE-10, MUT-16, and NRDE-3, work together to silence genes. Any two of these proteins are required to silence one gene, but each protein is singly required to silence another gene. The requirement for NRDE-3 can be overcome by enhancing the processing of dsRNA. The researchers used quantitative models and simulations to explore the dynamics of RNAi and found that changing the cis-regulatory elements of a target gene can reduce its dependence on NRDE-3.

     The study also found that animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells and that the cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within 'pUG zones' matching the dsRNA. These findings suggest that similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in apparently selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

     The researchers used the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system to examine how differences between target genes and reliance on specific regulators contribute to the efficacy and resistance of RNAi. They found that the requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA, suggesting that loss of NRDE-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing.

     The study's findings have implications for the use of RNAi as a tool for gene silencing in plants, insects, and humans. The researchers suggest that gene-specific factors can influence the functional outcome of RNAi and propose a more detailed dynamic model to explain the molecular mechanism of RNAi in C. elegans. Further studies are needed to test each aspect of the model.
Summary
     Biomedical researchers conducted a study to understand the underlying mechanisms of tuberculous meningitis (TBM), a severe form of tuberculosis that affects the brain and spinal cord. They analyzed whole-blood RNA sequencing data from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 30 healthy controls. The study aimed to identify genes and pathways associated with TBM severity and mortality, and to determine the best predictors of death.

     The researchers used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality. They found that increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. In HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization.

     The study also identified four hub genes – MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4 – as strong predictors of TBM mortality. These findings suggest that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death. A four-gene signature was identified as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status.

     The researchers used multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death in HIV-negative and HIV-positive TBM patients separately. For HIV-negative TBM, the combination of common hub genes, HIV-negative specific hub genes, and clinical biomarkers such as age, TBM severity, and CSF lymphocyte count were selected as predictors. For HIV-positive TBM, the selected predictors included common hub genes, HIV-specific hub genes, and clinical biomarkers.

     The study characterized a global dysregulation in immune responses, including inflammation, and revealed specific functional pathways and hub genes involved in TBM and the mechanisms leading to death. Transcriptional profiles associated with TBM mortality stratified by HIV status showed that HIV-negative individuals had 786 differentially expressed genes, while HIV-positive individuals had 1620 differentially expressed genes. The study's findings provide insights for potential therapeutic targets and a novel four-gene biomarker for predicting outcomes in TBM patients.
Summary
     Antibodies are essential tools in biomedical research, used to detect and characterize proteins. However, many commercial antibodies do not recognize their intended targets, making it difficult to assess the feasibility of having a potent and specific antibody for each protein in the human proteome. To address this issue, researchers developed a standardized characterization approach to evaluate the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 neuroscience-related proteins. The study found that more than 50% of the antibodies failed in one or more applications, but around 50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, suggesting significant coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The study also identified hundreds of underperforming antibodies used in published articles, raising concerns about the reliability of research findings.

     The researchers used optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in three common applications: Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. They tested antibodies against a variety of neuroscience targets and found that approximately two-thirds of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, and half was covered by at least one high-performing renewable antibody. The study provides an unbiased and scalable analytical framework for representing and comparing antibody performance, estimating the coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies, and assessing the scientific value of common antibody characterization methods.

     The findings suggest that the existing commercial antibody repertoire can be mined to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts. The study's data are openly available, and the results inform a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all human proteins. The research highlights the importance of validating commercial antibodies to ensure the reliability of research findings and the need for a comprehensive and standardized ecosystem to validate commercial antibodies.
Summary
     Biologists studying inter-organ communication in animals face a significant challenge: controlling gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously. To address this need, researchers have developed technologies that combine the GAL4/UAS system with a second binary expression system, such as the LexA system or QF system. A new resource has been created to facilitate the combined use of these systems in Drosophila (fruit fly) tissues.

     The resource includes a set of over 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions generated by CRISPR knock-in, which have been verified for tissue specificity in larvae. Additionally, constructs have been built that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. These constructs can be integrated into the fly genome, allowing for the isolation of fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD.

     The new resource also includes compatible shRNA vectors for in vivo gene knockdown and a library of RNAi fly lines. This will enable researchers to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. The LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for Drosophila researchers who need to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously.

     The development of this resource was made possible by a company that synthesizes and clones plasmids containing the necessary features for CRISPR HDR and a cloning site for ligation of T2A-LexA-GAD, T2A-QF, or T2A-LexA-GAD-T2A-QF fragments. A set of genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns was selected, and CRISPR-based HDR was used to introduce T2A-LexA-GAD or T2A-QF2 into the fly genome.

     The resulting stocks, vectors, and protocols will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously. This will facilitate the study of inter-organ communication and other complex biological processes. The new resource is expected to be a valuable tool for the Drosophila research community.
Summary
     The transcription factor Bcl11b plays a crucial role in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is necessary for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Bcl11b's function remained unclear.

     Researchers have identified a synaptic organizer molecule called C1ql2 as a direct functional target of Bcl11b. C1ql2 regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in both living mice and lab-grown cells. Furthermore, C1ql2 exerts its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, called Nrxn3 (25b+).

     Interruption of the C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+) interaction by expressing a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or deleting Nrxn3 in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b and C1ql2 mutant phenotypes. This study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function.

     Bcl11b has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Previous studies have shown that Bcl11b is essential for synapse function in the mossy fiber circuit of the adult murine hippocampus. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of Bcl11b's function remained unclear.

     Researchers have previously demonstrated that Bcl11b plays a crucial role in the development of the hippocampal mossy fiber system, adult hippocampal neurogenesis, and hippocampal learning and memory. In the mature hippocampus, Bcl11b is critical for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber synapses.

     This study identifies a novel Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3 (25b+)-dependent regulatory mechanism that is essential for the control of mossy fiber synapse function. Recent genetic studies suggested that single components of this pathway are associated with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. This study demonstrates these molecules to be interconnected in one regulatory pathway for the first time.

     Conditional ablation of Bcl11b in the adult hippocampus leads to structural and functional changes of mossy fiber synapses, characterized by an overall reduction in synapse numbers, loss of bouton complexity, misdistribution of synaptic vesicles, and loss of long-term potentiation. Reintroduction of the synaptic organizer protein C1ql2, which is a direct transcriptional target of Bcl11b and is downregulated in Bcl11b mutant dentate gyrus granule neurons, rescues these changes. This study identifies a Bcl11b/C1ql2/Nrxn3-dependent signaling pathway in the control of basic structural and functional properties of mossy fiber synapses. Analysis of this regulatory pathway in mice may provide important novel insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Summary
     Biologists have long sought to understand how cells regulate gene expression, the process by which the information encoded in DNA is converted into proteins. A key part of this process is the interplay between transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries, which must communicate effectively for the cell to function properly. The zinc-finger protein Sfp1 plays a crucial role in this process, regulating the transcription of genes involved in cell proliferation.

     Researchers have discovered that Sfp1 can regulate transcription in two ways: by binding to the promoter regions of genes, similar to other transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions of genes, known as gene bodies. When Sfp1 binds to gene bodies, it affects the configuration of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) enzyme, which is responsible for transcribing DNA into RNA. Specifically, Sfp1 causes Pol II to dissociate or undergo a conformational change, leading to increased backtracking, a process in which the enzyme pauses or reverses direction during transcription.

     Interestingly, Sfp1 also binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally, or during the process of transcription, and stabilizes them. This interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by the promoter regions of the genes and coincides with Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that make up the chromosome.

     The study found that Sfp1's dissociation from chromatin correlates with the extent of backtracked Pol II, suggesting that Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1's relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability.

     The researchers propose that Sfp1's co-transcriptional binding imprints the fate of mRNAs, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs. They also suggest that Sfp1's two modes of transcription regulation are connected, with its effect on transcription elongation linked to its function on mRNA stabilization.

     The study provides new insights into the complex mechanisms of gene expression and the role of Sfp1 in regulating transcription and mRNA stability. Further research is needed to fully understand the interplay between Sfp1's two modes of transcription regulation.
Summary
     Biologists have long known that programmed cell death (PCD) plays a crucial role in plant development and growth. However, a new study reveals that PCD also serves as a defense mechanism against microbial invasion in plant roots. Researchers investigated the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO (SMB) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1.

     The study found that mutations in both SMB and BFN1 increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone of the root. The researchers propose that a tight regulation of host PCD and rapid clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. They also discovered that S. indica downregulates BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation.

     Reporter lines and transcriptional analysis revealed that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells. This suggests a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots. The study emphasizes that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant PCD processes to enhance host colonization.

     The researchers found that impaired PCD in the Arabidopsis smb-3 and bfn1-1 mutants increased colonization by S. indica. The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolonization along the entire primary root, suggesting that the extra sheet of cell corpses surrounding smb-3 roots provide additional and easily accessible nutrients that fuel fungal colonization.

     The study suggests that some adapted microbes manipulate host PCD processes by affecting the transcriptional expression of BFN1 to facilitate accommodation in the root. Whether active interference by fungal effector proteins, fungal-derived signaling molecules, or a systemic response of Arabidopsis roots underlies BFN1 downregulation by S. indica remains to be investigated.

     The researchers performed transcriptome analysis, tracking developmental cell death-marker gene expression during different colonization stages. They found that the major regulator in LRCs, SMB, showed no significant changes in expression during fungal colonization. However, in Arabidopsis colonized by S. indica, there was a significant decrease in BFN1 expression observed after 6 days post-inoculation. The study provides new insights into the complex relationship between plant PCD and microbial accommodation in roots.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have discovered a new mechanism that may contribute to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. They found that large vesicles, called exophers, are produced by neurons and can spread pathogenic protein aggregates and trigger inflammatory responses. The study focused on the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to investigate the factors that regulate exopher production.

     The researchers found that mechanical force, or pressure, can significantly increase the production of exophers from proteostressed neurons. They also discovered that the production of exophers peaks in adult C. elegans at day 2 or 3, which coincides with the worm's reproductive peak. The study suggests that the mechanical force of uterine occupation, or the filling of the uterus, potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons.

     The researchers further investigated the role of fertilized eggs, sperm, and oocytes in exopher production. They found that genetic disruption of the germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions can strongly increase ALMR exopher production.

     The study also found that the presence of fertilized eggs is not necessary for exopher production. Instead, the mechanical force of uterine occupation, such as filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid, can enhance exopher production. The researchers conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons.

     The findings of this study highlight the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms. The study suggests that the mechanical force of uterine occupation can trigger the production of exophers, which can contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. The researchers propose that enhanced attention to mechanobiology may be necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.
Biomedical research has shed light on the potential role of the Wnt signaling pathway in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, a protein called Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) has been found to be involved in the development of AD. DKK3 is a secreted protein that acts as an antagonist to the Wnt signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of synapses in the brain.

Studies have shown that DKK3 is upregulated in the brains of individuals with AD and that its levels increase early in the disease. In mouse models of AD, DKK3 has been found to accumulate around amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of the disease. Furthermore, research has demonstrated that DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through the blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway, leading to a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via the activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway.

In contrast, knocking down DKK3 in mouse models of AD has been shown to restore synapse number and improve memory. These findings suggest that DKK3 is a key driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in AD. The study also found that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways.

In vivo studies in mouse models of AD have demonstrated that knocking down DKK3 ameliorates the changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus, both before and after plaque deposition. This suggests that DKK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in AD. The study also found that DKK3 affects synapse number around amyloid plaques, which is a key feature of AD brains.

Overall, the findings of this study provide new insights into the mechanisms that contribute to synapse vulnerability in AD and suggest that DKK3 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of the disease. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of DKK3 in AD and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have been searching for new ways to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One approach is to find natural compounds produced by microbes that can inhibit the growth of pathogens. A team of scientists has discovered that pyoverdines, a type of siderophore produced by certain bacteria, have strong antibacterial properties. These compounds work by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens.

     The researchers screened 320 natural isolates of Pseudomonas bacteria against 12 human pathogens and found several pyoverdines with high antibacterial properties. The most potent pyoverdine reduced the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. This means that the effectiveness of the pyoverdine depends on the amount present and the availability of iron in the environment.

     The scientists also tested the pyoverdine on infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and found that it increased their survival rates. Additionally, the pyoverdine showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. This suggests that pyoverdines could be a safe and effective treatment option for certain bacterial infections.

     To further investigate the potential of pyoverdines, the researchers used experimental evolution and whole-genome sequencing to study the development of resistance in pathogens. They found that resistance to pyoverdines evolved at a slower rate compared to antibiotics. This indicates that pyoverdines may be less likely to contribute to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

     The discovery of pyoverdines as a new class of antibacterials has significant implications for the treatment of bacterial infections. These compounds are produced by non-pathogenic bacteria, making them a sustainable and environmentally friendly option. The researchers propose that pyoverdines could be used to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition. Further studies are needed to fully explore the potential of pyoverdines as a treatment option for bacterial infections.
Summary
     Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that affects the brain's prefrontal networks, but the exact mechanisms behind this disruption are not yet fully understood. Recent studies have shown that genetic mutations and environmental factors can alter synaptic function, leading to prefrontal network failures in schizophrenia. However, the link between these disruptions at the synaptic level and failures at the network level remains unclear.

     To address this knowledge gap, researchers developed a computational model of the prefrontal local circuits in the brain. This model aimed to explain the connection between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. The model analyzed how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influences oscillatory spike synchrony.

     The results showed that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, such as those that occur during behavior. This finding parallels the dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony observed between neurons in the monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists.

     The study established a theoretical basis and circuit mechanism explaining how the reduction of NMDAR synaptic function implicated in schizophrenia could lead to the desynchronization of neural activity in prefrontal recurrent circuits. The researchers provided evidence that spiking networks situated close to a boundary in the synaptic parameter space separating asynchronous and synchronous activity states can explain a variety of biological observations.

     Importantly, the study showed that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents these networks from transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony. This finding provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia.
summary
     Biomedical researchers have been studying the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones. This process is crucial for various physiological and pathological conditions, including wound healing, cancer growth, and cardiovascular diseases. A key step in angiogenesis is the differentiation of endothelial cells into two distinct cell types: Tip and Stalk cells. These cells play a vital role in the formation of new blood vessels, with Tip cells leading the way and Stalk cells following behind.

     A team of researchers used a combination of experimental and computational approaches to investigate the dynamics of Tip and Stalk cell patterning during angiogenesis. They found that the regular spatial patterning of these cells can undergo an order-disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor called VEGF. This transition results in a robust but temporally unstable differentiation of cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions.

     The researchers also discovered that sprouts form in a manner that maximizes their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that depends on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. This model suggests that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation, enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis.

     The study's findings have implications for our understanding of cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and other complex morphogenic processes. The researchers propose that NOTCH signaling plays a crucial role in enabling the differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk cells, but additional cues and self-organization mechanisms are required for subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis.

     The study also highlights the importance of considering the interconnections between biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-Stalk fate. The researchers suggest that future models should explicitly integrate these interconnections to better understand the complex dynamics of angiogenesis. Overall, the study provides new insights into the mechanisms underlying angiogenesis and has the potential to inform the development of new therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis-related diseases.
Summary
     The locus coeruleus (LC) is a small region in the brain that plays a crucial role in learning and memory. It sends signals to the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in forming and storing memories. However, the exact timing of these signals and which neurotransmitters the LC uses to communicate with the hippocampus are not well understood. The LC is typically thought to release a neurotransmitter called norepinephrine, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine, which could be more important for memory formation.

     In this study, researchers used mice to investigate how the LC communicates with the hippocampus during a type of learning called trace fear conditioning. They found that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to important learning-related events and that enhancing these responses can improve long-term memory formation. The researchers also discovered that the LC releases both norepinephrine and dopamine into the hippocampus, and that the timing of dopamine release is similar to the timing of LC activity.

     Importantly, the study showed that dopamine, but not norepinephrine, is necessary for trace fear memory formation. This suggests that the release of dopamine from the LC may enhance learning-related plasticity in the brain regions involved in trace fear conditioning. The findings of this study provide new insights into the complex communication between the LC and the hippocampus and highlight the importance of dopamine in memory formation.

     The study's results have implications for our understanding of how the brain processes and stores memories, particularly those related to fear and anxiety. The findings could also inform the development of new treatments for conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders, which are characterized by impaired memory and learning. Further research is needed to fully understand the role of the LC and dopamine in memory formation and to explore the potential therapeutic applications of these findings.
