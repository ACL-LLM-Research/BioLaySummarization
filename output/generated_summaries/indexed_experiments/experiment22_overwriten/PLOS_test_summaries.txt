A new study identified a mutation in SEM-2 that affects its function in regulating dorsoventral patterning and the proliferation of specific cell lineages. SEM-2 interacts with other transcription factors like LET-381 and directly influences the expression of hlh-8, a gene important for proper cell patterning. These findings shed light on the gene regulatory network involved in C. elegans development and provide insights into the functions of SoxC proteins in multicellular organisms.
