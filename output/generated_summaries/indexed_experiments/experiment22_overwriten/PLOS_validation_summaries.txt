This study investigated the impact of alternative polyadenylation on gene expression in human B-lymphoblastoid cells. The research revealed that genetic variants in polyadenylation signals and other 3' motifs significantly influence gene expression levels. By mapping the cis-regulatory architecture of 3' gene ends, the study demonstrated that transcript end positions are not random but are associated with regulatory elements like miRNA sites. The findings suggest that integrating 3' end positions with regulatory motifs is crucial for interpreting human genome variation. The study highlights the importance of RNA 3'-end processing in gene regulation and its potential role in determining individual differences in gene expression levels.
The study investigated the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals using deep sequencing and epitope mapping. Results showed that the initial response targeted variable epitopes, leading to viral escape. This escape expanded the CD8 T cell repertoire targeting conserved epitopes, termed anentropic specificity, and generated new responses to escape variants. The maturation of the CD8 T cell response correlated with SIVΔnef-induced protection, highlighting the importance of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design. The findings demonstrate the coevolution of the virus and CD8 T cell response, resulting in an enhanced and diversified immune response post-vaccination.
