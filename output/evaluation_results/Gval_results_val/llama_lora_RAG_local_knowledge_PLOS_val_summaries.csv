test_case_1,"The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth .

Finally, we demonstrate concomitant coevolution of the virus and the specificity of the CD8 T cell response, resulting in a CD8 T cell repertoire with increased anentropic specificity, wider cumulative breadth, rearranged immunodominance and enhanced depth.","Annually , more than two million people are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIVΔnef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIVΔnef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIVΔnef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV .

Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5, we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation. Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate.","Messenger RNAs carry the instructions necessary to synthesize proteins that do work for the cell . Extending beyond the protein-coding sequence of a given mRNA is an additional stretch of sequence , harboring signals that govern how much protein is made and how long the mRNA remains in the cell before it is broken down . The incorporation of this end region into mature mRNA is itself subject to change; for the vast majority of human genes , how and why cells use different mRNA ends remains largely unknown . In this work , we surveyed mRNA ends from ∼10 , 000 genes in immune cells from genetically distinct human individuals . We found that mRNA end positions were not randomly distributed , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of regulatory signals that govern mRNA fate . The usage of these mRNA length forms and regulatory elements varied across individuals and could be dissected molecularly . Our results uncover key mechanisms and regulatory effects of transcript end processing , particularly as these are perturbed by genetic differences between humans .",True,0.6033620597049676,"The actual output covers the key points from the input text, but some differences in wording are present.

test_case_2,"Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .","Candida albicans is one of the most common causes of mucosal fungal infections. In this study, we investigated the role of interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) in the neutrophil response to C. albicans in the oral mucosa. We used a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) to show that IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection. We found that IL-1R signaling regulates the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection through the production of neutrophil-chemotactic factors by epithelial cells. We also found that IL-1R signaling regulates the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow through the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ). We identified endothelial cells as the primary source of G-CSF in the oral mucosa, which responded to IL-1α released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue. We confirmed this IL-1-dependent crosstalk between keratinocytes and endothelial cells in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line. Our data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection.","The opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans is a major risk factor for immunosuppressed individuals , and oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) is a frequent complication in patients with weakened cellular immunity . The cytokine interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) plays a critical role for antifungal host defense and was proposed to act by regulating neutrophil recruitment to the oral mucosa . However , although IL-17 can promote neutrophil trafficking in some situations , we recently showed in a mouse model that this is not the case during OPC . Thus , the mechanism governing the neutrophil response to C . albicans remained to be determined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1α is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis . Thereby , IL-1R signaling translates the local response to the fungus in the oral mucosa into a systemic response that critically contributes to protection from infection .",True,0.584610962622433,"The lay summary retains major findings and themes from the source abstract, but lacks some specific details such as the role of endothelial cells as the primary source of G-CSF, and fails to mention the importance of IL-1 in coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa."
test_case_13,"In the current context of high fatality rates associated with American visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) , the appropriate use of prognostic factors to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes represents a potential tool for clinical practice . This systematic review brings together information reported in studies conducted in Latin America , on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis ( continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient despite the implementation of treatment , independent of the occurrence of death ) and death from VL . The limitations of the existing knowledge , the advances achieved and the approaches to be used in future research are presented . The full texts of 14 studies conforming to the inclusion criteria were analyzed and their methodological quality examined by means of a tool developed in the light of current research tools . Information regarding prognostic variables was synthesized using meta-analysis . Variables were grouped according to the strength of evidence considering summary measures , patterns and heterogeneity of effect-sizes , and the results of multivariate analyses . The strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage , HIV coinfection , diarrhea , age <5 and age >40–50 years , severe neutropenia , dyspnoea and bacterial infections . Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes . The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far . Integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes . The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations .","Visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) is a serious public health problem in endemic regions, especially in Latin America, where it is one of the most neglected diseases in the world. VL is closely associated with poverty, for which effective and affordable chemotherapies remain scarce. In this context, the identification of prognostic factors to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes represents a potential tool for clinical practice. A systematic review of 14 studies conducted in Latin America was performed to identify potential predictors of adverse prognosis and death from VL. The strongest predictors identified were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, Leishmania-HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and age >40–50 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnoea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far. Integration of the results from different investigations enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes. The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations.","In contrast to other clinical presentations of leishmaniasis in Latin America , American visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) can lead to death in 5-10% of patients under treatment . The fatality rates associated with this disease have remained stable at a high level over the years in Brazil and are neither recorded in under-treatment patients from endemic countries of the Old World nor from non-endemic countries where such cases are imported . Since VL-induced lethality can occur even after the implementation of recommended therapy , the understanding of individual , clinical and laboratory factors that predispose to an unfavorable outcome might represent an important feature for informing better practice in the clinical management of cases . The present systematic review with meta-analysis brings together information on various prognostic variables associated with the severity of VL . Potential predictors identified in the studies surveyed were grouped according to the strength of evidence available , and 13 were considered to be of significant relevance . The gaps in the existing knowledge and the need for the development of externally validated prognostic models were also discussed . The results presented herein could be useful in identifying patients at higher risk of unfavorable evolution or death from VL , and might provide an aid in decision-making regarding the clinical management of VL cases .",True,0.5059641013162918,"The summary lacks specific details mentioned in the Expected Output, such as the fatality rates associated with American visceral leishmaniasis, and does not cover all key points from the source abstract."
