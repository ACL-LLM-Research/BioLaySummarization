Reviewing multiple sources, including literature and databases from the World Health Organization, International Fund, and Labour, estimated $21.8 billion of economic benefits will be gained over lifetime of 31.4 million treated during first 8 years of GPE. This includes $2.3 billion from protection of nearly 3 million newborns and individuals from lymphatic filariasis due to being born in areas of LF transmission. Additionally, over 28 million infected with LF benefit from GFLF halting progression, resulting in $19.5 billion lifetime benefit. In addition to individual benefits, reduced services with LF morbidity save health systems of endemic countries $2.2 billion.

test_case_13,"In the current context of high fatality rates associated with American visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) , the appropriate use of prognostic factors to identify patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes represents a potential tool for clinical practice . This systematic review brings together information reported in studies conducted in Latin America , on the potential predictors of adverse prognosis ( continued evolution of the initial clinical conditions of the patient despite the implementation of treatment , independent of the occurrence of death ) and death from VL . The limitations of the existing knowledge , the advances achieved and the approaches to be used in future research are presented . The full texts of 14 studies conforming to the inclusion criteria were analyzed and their methodological quality examined by means of a tool developed in the light of current research tools . Information regarding prognostic variables was synthesized using meta-analysis . Variables were grouped according to the strength of evidence considering summary measures , patterns and heterogeneity of effect-sizes , and the results of multivariate analyses . The strongest predictors identified in this review were jaundice , thrombocytopenia , hemorrhage , HIV coinfection , diarrhea , age <5 and age >40–50 years , severe neutropenia , dyspnoea and bacterial infections . Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes . The main limitation identified was the absence of validation procedures for the few prognostic models developed so far . Integration of the results from different investigations conducted over the last 10 years enabled the identification of consistent prognostic variables that could be useful in recognizing and handling VL patients at higher risk of unfavorable outcomes . The development of externally validated prognostic models must be prioritized in future investigations .","A systematic review was conducted to identify prognostic factors for adverse outcomes in American visceral leishmanias (VL) in Latin America. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for methodological quality using a research tool. Prognostic variables were synthesized through meta-analysis, grouped by strength of evidence, heterogeneity, and multivariate analysis. The strongest predictors were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and >40 years, neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The main limitation was the absence of validation for prognostic models. Integration of results from 10 years identified consistent prognostic variables for recognizing patients at risk of unfavorable outcomes.","In contrast to other clinical presentations of leishmaniasis in Latin America , American visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) can lead to death in 5-10% of patients under treatment . The fatality rates associated with this disease have remained stable at a high level over the years in Brazil and are neither recorded in under-treatment patients from endemic countries of the Old World nor from non-endemic countries where such cases are imported . Since VL-induced lethality can occur even after the implementation of recommended therapy , the understanding of individual , clinical and laboratory factors that predispose to an unfavorable outcome might represent an important feature for informing better practice in the clinical management of cases . The present systematic review with meta-analysis brings together information on various prognostic variables associated with the severity of VL . Potential predictors identified in the studies surveyed were grouped according to the strength of evidence available , and 13 were considered to be of significant relevance . The gaps in the existing knowledge and the need for the development of externally validated prognostic models were also discussed . The results presented herein could be useful in identifying patients at higher risk of unfavorable evolution or death from VL , and might provide an aid in decision-making regarding the clinical management of VL cases .",True,0.5538743156548438,"The actual output provides a concise summary of the study's methodology, results, and limitations compared to the detailed findings and predictions highlighted in the expected output."
test_case_18,"The pseudorabies virus ( PRV ) Us9 protein plays a central role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons . As a result , Us9 null mutants are defective in anterograde transmission of infection in vivo . However , it is unclear how Us9 promotes axonal sorting of so many viral proteins . It is known that the glycoproteins gB , gC , gD and gE are associated with lipid raft microdomains on the surface of infected swine kidney cells and monocytes , and are directed into the axon in a Us9-dependent manner . In this report , we determined that Us9 is associated with lipid rafts , and that this association is critical to Us9-mediated sorting of viral structural proteins . We used infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells , a rat pheochromocytoma cell line that acquires many of the characteristics of sympathetic neurons in the presence of nerve growth factor ( NGF ) . In these cells , Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes ( DRMs ) . Moreover , reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibited anterograde transmission of infection from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells in vitro . We conclude that association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting of structural proteins to axons and , as a consequence , for directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons and cells of the mammalian nervous system .","Pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral glycoproteins to axons of sympathetic neurons, with Us null mutants defective in anterograde transmission in vivo. The mechanism of Us-mediated axonal sorting of viral proteins is unclear. Glycoproteins B, C, D, and E are associated with lipid rafts on infected cells and directed into axons in Us-dependent manner. This study investigated Us association with lipid rafts and its role in viral protein sorting. Non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a ratheochromocytoma line with sympathetic characteristics in NGF, were used. Us was enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Reducing Us lipid raft affinity inhibited antograde transmission from neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. Association of Us with lipid rafts is key for targeting structural proteins to axons and directional PR spread from pre-synaptic to postynaptic neurons in mammalian nervous system.","Alpha herpesviruses are common mammalian pathogens ( e . g . herpes simplex and chickenpox virus infect humans ) . These viruses enter and spread in and out of the mammalian nervous system , a defining hallmark of their lifecycle and potential pathogenesis . Neurons are polarized cells , and the movement of certain cellular proteins is highly restricted to the cell body , to dendrites , or to axons . Indeed , the axon harbors only a small subset of neuronal proteins . Thus , it is remarkable that these viruses efficiently gather and move their structural components from the cell body to the axon after infection of neurons . Previously , we identified a small viral membrane protein ( known as Us9 ) that mediates the efficient targeting of virus particles to axons of infected neurons . We now report that Us9 must localize to “lipid raft” domains , specialized regions within cellular membranes to promote axonal targeting . Reducing the affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts dramatically reduces sorting of structural proteins to axons . This is the first report , to our knowledge , to implicate lipid rafts in targeting alpha herpesvirus structural proteins to axons , an essential step for spread of infection in the mammalian nervous system .",False,0.35294104945838123,"The summary provides a condensed version of the major findings and themes from the source abstract, but there are slight inaccuracies such as 'viral glycoproteins' instead of 'viral structural proteins'. The readability is mostly clear and fluent but lacks some specificity for a non-expert audience. The factuality is maintained concerning lipid rafts and their association with Us9 for sorting viral proteins to axons. Overall, the summary captures key aspects but could be more precise and tailored for a general audience."
