test_case_2,"Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .","Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a crucial role in coordinating the neutrophil response to Candida albicans in oral mucosal infections. In a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) signaling is essential for controlling the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels: the recruitment of circulating neutils to the site of infection and mobilization of newly generated neutils from the bone marrow. IL-1-deficient mice display impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in circulation in response to C. albicans. Strikingly, endothelial cells are the primary source of G-CS during OPC, responding to IL-α released from keratinocytes in infected tissue. The IL-dependent crosstalk between different subsets of hematopoietic compartment confirmed in vitro using murine-derived kerocyte line and endothelial line. These data establish a link between IL and granopoies in fungal infection context. Two mechanisms coordinating neutil response in mucosa critical preventing fungal growth dissemination and host disease protection identified.","The opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans is a major risk factor for immunosuppressed individuals , and oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) is a frequent complication in patients with weakened cellular immunity . The cytokine interleukin-17 ( IL-17 ) plays a critical role for antifungal host defense and was proposed to act by regulating neutrophil recruitment to the oral mucosa . However , although IL-17 can promote neutrophil trafficking in some situations , we recently showed in a mouse model that this is not the case during OPC . Thus , the mechanism governing the neutrophil response to C . albicans remained to be determined . Here , we demonstrate an essential role of IL-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling in the recruitment of neutrophils from the circulation to the infected tissue via enhanced secretion of chemokines and increased output of neutrophils from the bone marrow . We found that IL-1α is released from keratinocytes upon invasion of C . albicans and acts on endothelial cells to induce the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , a key trigger of emergency granulopoiesis . Thereby , IL-1R signaling translates the local response to the fungus in the oral mucosa into a systemic response that critically contributes to protection from infection .",False,0.3164752217954966,"The input and actual output have a high level of similarity in terms of content, demonstrating understanding and relevance."
test_case_0,"Gene expression varies widely between individuals of a population , and regulatory change can underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical relevance . A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation .","Researchers conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblast cells from genetically distinct human individuals to investigate the role of RNA 3'-end processing in gene regulation.

The findings suggest integrating 3 positions with 3 motifs will be a tool in efforts to interpret human variation.","Messenger RNAs carry the instructions necessary to synthesize proteins that do work for the cell . Extending beyond the protein-coding sequence of a given mRNA is an additional stretch of sequence , harboring signals that govern how much protein is made and how long the mRNA remains in the cell before it is broken down . The incorporation of this end region into mature mRNA is itself subject to change; for the vast majority of human genes , how and why cells use different mRNA ends remains largely unknown . In this work , we surveyed mRNA ends from ∼10 , 000 genes in immune cells from genetically distinct human individuals . We found that mRNA end positions were not randomly distributed , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of regulatory signals that govern mRNA fate . The usage of these mRNA length forms and regulatory elements varied across individuals and could be dissected molecularly . Our results uncover key mechanisms and regulatory effects of transcript end processing , particularly as these are perturbed by genetic differences between humans .",False,0.27951579557689843,"The information in the Actual Output does not fully capture the detailed findings and significance presented in the Expected Output.

test_case_1,"The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .","Researchers have investigated the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of the SIVΔne vaccine, a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine that provides strong protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. Using deep sequencing and CD8 cell epitope mapping, they analyzed the CD8 T cell response in SIVne-vaccinated animals to identify regions of immune pressure and viral escape. The study found that the initial CD8 response in the acute phase of SIVne infection targeted variable epitopes, followed by widespread viral sequence evolution and escape. Epitope escape led to expansion of the CD8 repertoire targeting conserved epitopes, defined by anotropic specificity, and de novo responses to escaped variants during vaccination. These findings correlate SIVne-induced protection with anotropic specificity and increased response depth.","Annually , more than two million people are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIVΔnef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIVΔnef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIVΔnef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV . Our findings also reinforce the importance of developing HIV vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus as well as their potential variants .",False,0.2231446542265468,"The actual output does not provide the information requested in the input, lacks specific details related to the immune response evolution, and does not align with the expected output."
