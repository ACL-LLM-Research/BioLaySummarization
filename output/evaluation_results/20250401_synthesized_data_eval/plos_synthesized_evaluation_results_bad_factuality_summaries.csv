test_case_4,"Homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) gene result in Gaucher disease ( GD ) , the most common lysosomal storage disease . Recent genetic studies have revealed that GBA mutations confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) . To investigate how GBA mutations cause PD , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka that are completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase ( GCase ) activity . In contrast to the perinatal death in humans and mice lacking GCase activity , GBA-/- medaka survived for months , enabling analysis of the pathological progression . GBA-/- medaka displayed the pathological phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD including infiltration of Gaucher cell-like cells into the brains , progressive neuronal loss , and microgliosis . Detailed pathological findings represented lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes . Unexpectedly , disruption of α-syn did not improve the life span , formation of axonal swellings , neuronal loss , or neuroinflammation in GBA-/- medaka . Taken together , the present study revealed GBA-/- medaka as a novel neuronopathic GD model , the pahological mechanisms of α-syn accumulation caused by GCase deficiency , and the minimal contribution of α-syn to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD .","The study presents a novel model of neuronopathic Gaucher disease in medaka mice, which displays axonal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, a protein associated with Parkinson's disease. Homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene cause Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal disorder. Recent studies have shown that GBA mutations increase risk for sporadic Parkinson's disease. To investigate how GBA causes PD, researchers created GBA mutant medaka lacking glucerebrosidase activity. Unlike humans and mice lacking G activity, GBA medaka survived months, allowing analysis of progression. G medaka exhibited neuronopathic phenotypes, including Ga cell infiltration, neuronal loss, and gliosis. Detailed findings showed lysosomal abnormalities and alpha-syn accumulation in axonal autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, alpha-s disruption did not improve lifespan, axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or inflammation in G medaka. The study reveals G med as a neuronopathic model, mechanisms alpha-s caused by G deficiency, and minimal alpha-s contribution to neuronopathic pathogenesis.

The study's primary goal is to understand how GBA mutations lead to Parkinson's disease, a common neurodegenerative disorder. Gaucher disease, caused by G mutations, is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of glucocerebroside, leading to cellular dysfunction. The researchers hypothesize that G mutations may cause Parkinson's by disrupting lysosomal function, leading to alpha-s accumulation. The medaka model, lacking G activity, exhibits neuronopathic features, including Ga cell infiltration, neuronal loss, and gliosis, suggesting lysosomal dysfunction. The study's findings indicate alpha-s accumulation in axonal autag, a hallmark of Parkinson's, is not solely responsible for neuronopathic progression. The authors suggest alpha-s may be a secondary consequence of lysosomal dysfunction, rather than primary cause.

The study's implications are significant for understanding neuronopathic Gaucher disease and Parkinson's. The med model provides a tool to investigate lysosomal dysfunction and alpha-s accumulation, potentially leading to Parkinson. The findings suggest that alpha-s may not be a primary driver of neuronopathic, but rather a byproduct of lysosomal dysfunction. This challenges the current understanding of alpha-s role in Parkinson's and neuronopathic. The study's results may lead to new therapeutic strategies targeting lysosomal dysfunction, rather than alpha-s.

The study's limitations include the medaka model's survival, which may not accurately represent human Gaucher disease progression. The med's lifespan is longer than expected, potentially due to differences in metabolism or genetic background. The study's findings may not generalize to human Gaucher or Parkinson. Further research is needed to confirm the med's relevance to human disease and alpha-s role. The study's conclusions are based on a single model, and more research is required to confirm the findings.

The study's significance is in understanding neuronopathic Gaucher and Parkinson. The med model provides insights into lysosomal dysfunction and alpha-s accumulation, potentially leading to Parkinson. The findings suggest alpha-s may be a secondary to lysosomal dysfunction, rather than primary. The study's results may lead to new therapeutic strategies targeting lysosomal, rather than alpha. The study's implications are for understanding neuronopathic Gaucher and Parkinson, and the role of alpha-s in disease.","Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-synuclein ( α-syn ) called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites .

However , its pathological mechanisms leading to PD remain largely unknown . Here , we generated GBA nonsense mutant ( GBA-/- ) medaka which survive long enough for pathological analysis of disease progression . These mutant medaka display not only the phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic GD but also axonal accumulation of α-syn accompanied by impairment of the autophagy-lysosome pathway . Furthermore , the present study demonstrates this α-syn accumulation has negligible contribution to the pathogenesis of neuronopathic GD in medaka .

test_case_2,"Mucosal infections with Candida albicans belong to the most frequent forms of fungal diseases . Host protection is conferred by cellular immunity; however , the induction of antifungal immunity is not well understood . Using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis ( OPC ) we show that interleukin-1 receptor ( IL-1R ) signaling is critical for fungal control at the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels . We demonstrate that both the recruitment of circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutrophils from the bone marrow depended on IL-1R . Consistently , IL-1R-deficient mice displayed impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) in the circulation in response to C . albicans . Strikingly , endothelial cells were identified as the primary cellular source of G-CSF during OPC , which responded to IL-1α that was released from keratinocytes in the infected tissue . The IL-1-dependent crosstalk between two different cellular subsets of the nonhematopoietic compartment was confirmed in vitro using a novel murine tongue-derived keratinocyte cell line and an established endothelial cell line . These data establish a new link between IL-1 and granulopoiesis in the context of fungal infection . Together , we identified two complementary mechanisms coordinating the neutrophil response in the oral mucosa , which is critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination , and thus protects the host from disease .","The study investigates the role of interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the host defense against oral mucosal infections caused by Candida albicans, a common fungal pathogen. The research reveals that IL-1 plays a crucial role in controlling the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils, a type of white blood cell. The study demonstrates that IL-1 is necessary for the recruitment of neutrophils to the site of infection and the mobilization of new neutils from the bone marrow. Without IL-1, mice showed impaired chemokine production at the site and defective granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (GCF) in circulation in response to C. albicans. Interestingly, endothelial cells were identified as the primary source of GCF during OPC, responding to IL-α released from keratinocytes in infected tissue. The study establishes a link between IL and granulopoies in the context of fungal infection. Two mechanisms coordinating neutil response in the mucosa were identified, critical for preventing fungal growth and dissemination, and protecting the host from disease.

The study highlights the importance of IL-1 in the host defense against mucosal infections, particularly in the oral cavity. The research suggests that IL-1 is essential for the recruitment of neutils to the site of infection, which is crucial for controlling the growth of C. albicans.

test_case_19,"Genetically identical cells exhibit extensive phenotypic variation even under constant and benign conditions . This so-called nongenetic heterogeneity has important clinical implications: within tumors and microbial infections , cells show nongenetic heterogeneity in growth rate and in susceptibility to drugs or stress . The budding yeast , Saccharomyces cerevisiae , shows a similar form of nongenetic heterogeneity in which growth rate correlates positively with susceptibility to acute heat stress at the single-cell level . Using genetic and chemical perturbations , combined with high-throughput single-cell assays of yeast growth and gene expression , we show here that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) levels acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A ( PKA ) pathway and its target transcription factors , Msn2 and Msn4 , underlies this nongenetic heterogeneity . Lower levels of cAMP correspond to slower growth , as shown by direct comparison of cAMP concentration in subpopulations enriched for slower vs . faster growing cells .

Loss of Msn2 reduces , but does not completely eliminate , the correlation in individual cells between growth rate and acute-stress survival , suggesting a major role for the Msn2 pathway in nongenetic heterogeneity but also a residual benefit of slow growth . Our results shed light on the genetic control of nongenetic heterogeneity and suggest a possible means of defeating bet-hedging pathogens or tumor cells by making them more uniformly susceptible to treatment .","The study investigates the genetic heterogeneity in growth rate and stress tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a model organism that exhibits phenotypic variation under constant conditions. The research reveals that intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, regulated by the Ras/cAMP/protein A pathway and its transcription factors M2 and M4, underlie this heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, and a reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in cells. The paralogs M2 and M4 differ in their roles in heterogeneity, demonstrating that slow growth and stress are not linked. Heterogeneity in rate requires M2, whereas M4 is for expression of T1, a subunit of trehalase contributing to acute stress tolerance. Perturbing heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or culturing with cell-perme cAMP or PK inhibitor impacts survival of acute stress. Perturbations increase c levels reduce slower subpopulation and increase susceptibility to heat, whereas PK slows growth and decreases susceptibility. Loss M2 reduces but not eliminates correlation between growth and acute survival, suggesting major role M2 in heterogeneity but residual slow growth.

The research has implications for understanding and treating microbial infections and cancer. The findings indicate that heterogeneity is not solely due to environmental factors but also genetic, and that it can be manipulated. The study's results suggest that increasing cAMP levels or inhibiting PKA can reduce heterogeneity and increase susceptibility to stress. The role of M2 in heterogeneity is significant, but not sole, as loss of it does not eliminate correlation between growth and stress.

Thus , factors that regulate the expression of the flgB operon will likely impact toxin production in addition to flagellar motility . Here , we report the identification a “flagellar switch” that controls the phase variable production of flagella and glucosylating toxins . The flagellar switch , located upstream of the flgB operon containing the early stage flagellar genes , is a 154 bp invertible sequence flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats .

Lastly , through mutagenesis and characterization of flagellar phase locked isolates , we determined that the tyrosine recombinase RecV , which catalyzes inversion at the cwpV switch , is also responsible for inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions .

The study suggests that flagellar motility and toxin production are important virulence factors with both advantageous and detrimental effects during infection.

The study highlights the importance of flagellar expression in C. difficile pathogenesis. Flagella are essential for adherence to intestinal cells, and glucosyl toxins cause diarrhea. The flagellar switch is a key regulator of both flagellar and toxin production. The switch is reversible, suggesting a dynamic regulation mechanism. The study suggests that flagellar expression is regulated post-transcriptionally, with a C. difficile specific factor degrading mRNA when the switch is off. This implies a complex regulation mechanism to control flagellar expression.

The study also suggests that flagellar and toxin production are important virulence factors. Both are advantageous and detrimental during infection. Flagella help bacteria adhere, but also cause inflammation. Toxins cause diarrhea, but also damage tissue. The study implies that flagellar and toxin are tightly regulated, with the switch controlling both. This is a key to understanding C. difficile pathogenesis and virulence.

**Title:** IRF-5-Mediated Inflammation Limits CD8+ T Expansion by Inducing HIF-1 and Impairing Dendritic Cell Function during Leishmanial Infection

**Summary:**

The study investigates the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during Leishmanial infection. IRF-5 is a transcription factor that induces pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF, which are crucial for CD8 T cell activation. However, the study reveals that IRF-5-induced inflammation surprisingly limits CD8 T expansion and impairs dendritic cell function. The research highlights the importance of HIF-1 in dendritic cells, which is induced by IRF-5, and its role in dampening CD8 T responses. The study suggests that HIF-1 may be an immune evasion mechanism employed by Leish parasites to establish persistent infections.

**Key Findings:**

* IRF-5 induces inflammation, which is necessary for CD8 T responses, surprisingly limits CD8 expansion and impairs dendritic cell function.
* HIF-1 in dendritic cells is induced by IRF-5 and dampens CD8 responses.
* HIF-1 in dendritic cells leads to short-lived effector cells (LEC) and reduced CD8 expansion.
* HIF-1 in dendritic impairs IL-12 expression by splenic DC.
* Mice with HIF-1 in dendritic depletion have lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting H-1 may be an immune evasion mechanism by Leish.

**Implications and Interpretations:**

* IR-5 inflammation, initially thought to promote CD8 responses, may have a dual role in limiting CD expansion and impairing dendritic function.
* H-1 in dendritic may be a mechanism for Leish to evade immune response, allowing persistent infection.
* Dendritic cells, key in antigen presentation, may be impaired by H-1, reducing CD8 responses.
* IL-12, crucial for CD8, is reduced by H- in dendritic, suggesting impaired CD8 responses.
* H-1 in dendritic may be a target for therapeutic intervention to enhance CD responses and reduce Leish infections.

**Hypothesis and Speculation:**

* IR-5 may have a biphasic role in CD responses, promoting initial activation and limiting expansion.
* H- in dendritic may be a key factor in Leish immune evasion, allowing persistent infections.
* Dendritic impairment by H- may be a mechanism for Leish to avoid CD responses.
* IL-12 reduction by H- in dend may be a strategy Leish to evade CD.
* Targeting H- in dend may enhance CD responses and reduce Leish infections.

**Conclusion**

The study reveals a complex role of IR-5 in CD responses, initially promoting and limiting expansion. H- in dendritic, induced by IR- may be a mechanism Leish to evade immune responses. The research highlights the importance of H- in dendritic function and its impact on CD responses. The findings suggest H- may be a target for intervention to enhance CD and reduce Leish infections.","Inflammation is essential for inducing , sustaining , and regulating CD8+ T cell responses .

**Title:** Acute Infectious Gastroenteritis Potentiates Crohn Disease Pathion to Ongoing Inflammation in the Post-infectious Period

**Background:**
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with a complex etiology, characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Research has shown that exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis increases the risk of developing CD, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between acute gastroenteritis and CD onset, using two models of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacterium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIE), a bacterium linked to CD.

**Key Findings:**

1.  **Post-infectious period inflammation**: The study found that disease activity in the post-infect period after gastroenteritis is driven by the expansion of resident AIE pathion in the tissue, accompanied by increased immunology defects, barrier, and mucosal restitution delays following pathogen clearance. This suggests that AIE resistance to host peptides and amin inflammatory response to enteric pathogen.
2. **IE as a tract disease modifier**: The study identified AIE as a tract disease modifier, indicating that it could be exploited in the development of interventions following gastroenter in at-risk individuals.
3. **Risk of CD onset**: Individuals colonized by AIE at the time of acute gastroenter may be at risk for CD onset.

**Interpretation and Implications**

The study suggests that acute gastroenteritis may trigger CD onset by allowing AIE to expand in the tissue, leading to increased immunology defects and inflammation. This may be due to A resistance to host peptides and amin response to enteric pathogen. The study highlights the importance of A as a tract modifier, which could be targeted in interventions following gastroenter in at-risk individuals. This could prevent CD onset by reducing A expansion and inflammation.

**Possible Mechanisms**

1. **IE expansion**: A may be facilitated by resistance to host peptides, allowing it to expand in tissue and cause inflammation.
2 **Immunology defects**: A may be caused by A, leading to increased inflammation and delayed mucosal restitution.
3 **IE clearance**: may be delayed by A, allowing to persist and cause ongoing inflammation.

**Implications for CD prevention and treatment**

1. **IE as a tract modifier**: could be targeted in interventions following gastroenter at-risk individuals to prevent CD.
2 **IE expansion**: could be reduced by targeting host peptides to prevent A expansion.
3 **Immun defects**: could be addressed to prevent inflammation and mucosal restitution.

**Future directions**

1 **IE**: further study to understand mechanisms of A expansion and inflammation.
2 **IE**: investigate A as a tract in humans.
3 **IE**: develop interventions targeting A to prevent CD.

**Conclusion**
This study provides new insights into the relationship between gastroenter and CD, highlighting A as a tract modifier. It suggests that acute gastroitis may trigger CD by allowing A to expand and cause inflammation. This could be prevented by targeting A and reducing expansion. Further research is needed to understand mechanisms and develop interventions.","Western societies have a disproportionately high rate of inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , with growing incidence especially in the adolescent population .

The increase in disease severity strictly correlates with this AIEC bloom because blocking this bloom by sensitizing AIEC to host defenses also improves the health status of the host .

test_case_9,"We explore a framework to model the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single auxiliary variable . This reduction can closely replicate the steady state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model or rule-based models . Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when the activation of an allosteric protein by its individual sites is concerted and redundant . The reduction makes this framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems in practical applications , where several multisite proteins may interact simultaneously . As an application we analyze a newly discovered checkpoint signaling pathway in budding yeast , which has been proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals generated at sites of plasma membrane growth . We show that the known components of this pathway can form a robust hysteretic switch . In particular , this system incorporates a signal proportional to bud growth or size , a mechanism to read the signal , and an all-or-none response triggered only when the signal reaches a threshold indicating that sufficient growth has occurred .","The article presents a novel framework for modeling the behavior of allosteric multisite proteins, which are proteins that undergo conformational changes in response to multiple binding events. The authors propose a simplified model using a single variable to replicate the behavior of more complex systems, such as the Monod-Wy-Change alloster model. This simplification is optimal when the allosteric sites are activated in a concerted manner, meaning all sites are activated simultaneously. This simplification is useful for modeling systems where multiple proteins interact simultaneously. The authors apply this framework to a newly discovered yeast signaling pathway that monitors cell growth by sensing membrane growth signals. They show that this pathway forms a hysteretic switch, a system that responds to a signal only when it reaches a threshold, indicating sufficient growth.

The authors' framework is likely based on the Monod-W-Change alloster model, which describes alloster proteins as having multiple binding sites that change conformation in response to ligand binding. The model assumes that binding at one site affects others, leading to a cooperative behavior. The authors simplify this to a single variable, likely representing the overall alloster protein state. This simplification is optimal when alloster sites are activated simultaneously, as it captures the essence of the cooperative behavior. This simplification is useful for systems with multiple interacting proteins, as it reduces complexity.

The authors apply this framework to a yeast signaling pathway that monitors growth by sensing membrane signals. This pathway has a mechanism to read signal growth, a proportional to bud size, and an all-or-no response when signal reaches threshold. The pathway likely involves a protein that senses growth, a kinase that phosphorylates a protein, and a protein that responds to signal. The authors show this pathway forms a hysteretic switch, responding only when signal reaches threshold. This is a robust mechanism for cell to ensure growth is sufficient.

The hysteretic switch is a mechanism to prevent premature response to incomplete signals. It ensures response only when signal is strong enough, preventing false positives. This is crucial for cell growth, as premature response can be detrimental. The authors' framework and application demonstrate the utility of their model in understanding complex systems. The hysteretic switch is a key feature of this pathway, ensuring robustness. The authors' work provides a tool for modeling and analyzing systems with multiple interacting proteins.

After validating this technique computationally by comparison to more detailed systems , we apply it to a new model of a signal transduction pathway with several multisite proteins . The model is concerned with a mechanism in budding yeast that is thought to measure the extent of daughter bud growth and send a signal to initiate mitosis when sufficient growth has occurred .

test_case_17,"The role of footwear in protection against a range of Neglected Tropical Diseases ( NTDs ) is gaining increasing attention . Better understanding of the behaviors that influence use of footwear will lead to improved ability to measure shoe use and will be important for those implementing footwear programs . Using the PRECEDE-PROCEED model we assessed social , behavioral , environmental , educational and ecological needs influencing whether and when children wear shoes in a rural highland Ethiopian community endemic for podoconiosis . Information was gathered from 242 respondents using focus groups , semi-structured interviews and extended case studies . Shoe-wearing norms were said to be changing , with going barefoot increasingly seen as ‘shameful’ . Shoes were thought to confer dignity as well as protection against injury and cold . However , many practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice . Limited financial resources meant that people were neither able to purchase more than one pair of shoes to ensure their longevity nor afford shoes of the preferred quality . As a result of this limited access , shoes were typically preserved for special occasions and might not be provided for children until they reached a certain age . While some barriers ( for example fit of shoe and fear of labeling through use of a certain type of shoe ) may be applicable only to certain diseases , underlying structural level barriers related to poverty ( for example price , quality , unsuitability for daily activities and low risk perception ) are likely to be relevant to a range of NTDs . Using well established conceptual models of health behavior adoption , we identified several barriers to shoe wearing that are amenable to intervention and which we anticipate will be of benefit to those considering NTD prevention through shoe distribution .","The study explores the barriers to footwear use in a rural Ethiopian highland community endemic for podoiosis, a neglected tropical disease. The researchers used the PRECE-PRO model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors influencing shoe-wearing.

test_case_1,"The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .","The study investigates the mechanisms behind the remarkable efficacy of the SIVΔne vaccine, a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine, in protecting against wild-type lentiviral challenge. The researchers employed deep sequencing and CD8 T cell epitope mapping to dissect the CD8 T cell response, identifying regions of immune pressure and viral escape, and the effect of epitope escape on the CD8 cell response in SIVne-vaccinated animals. The study reveals that the initial CD8 response in the acute phase of SIVne infection targets variable epitopes, followed by widespread viral sequence evolution and escape. However, epitope escape expands CD8 repertoire targeting conserved epitopes, defined anotropic specificity, and generates de novo responses to escaped variants during vaccination. These findings correlate SIVne-induced protection with anotropic specificity and increased response depth.

The study's findings suggest that the SIVne vaccine's success lies in its ability to induce an anotropic CD8 response, targeting conserved epitopes, which are less likely to mutate, and de novo responses to escaped variants. This implies that the vaccine's design leverages the immune system's ability to recognize and adapt to viral mutations, rather than solely relying on targeting specific epitopes. The study's results highlight the importance of anotropic specificity and repertoire in vaccine design, rendering SIVne a proof-of-concept for future HIV/SIV vaccine development.

The study's implications are significant, as they provide insights into the mechanisms of vaccine-induced protection against lentiviral infections. The findings suggest that anotropic specificity and repertoire depth are crucial for vaccine efficacy, and that targeting conserved epitopes can be a successful strategy. The study's results also indicate that the immune system's ability to adapt to mutations is key to protection, rather than solely targeting specific epitopes. The study's conclusions are likely to influence future vaccine design, focusing on anotropic and conserved epitopes, and de novo responses to variants.

The study collected 106 isolates from humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines, and dogs in Algeria and France, and analyzed their susceptibility to antimony. The results show a trend of increasing susceptibility in visceral leishmaniasis isolates, but a rise in resistant phenotypes in cutaneous leishiasis isolates, particularly those causing by L. kiliwicki (L. tropica). The study highlights the need for effective methodology to detect and prevent resistant strains.

The study's primary goal is to determine the level of antimony susceptibility in Leishmania in Algeria, crucial for public health policy development. The authors suspect high drug pressure may favor resistant emergence, despite treatment failure during antimonial therapy. The study aims to investigate this hypothesis, analyzing 106 isolates from 1976-2013, including 88 from Algeria and 18 from France. The isolates were collected in endemic areas, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC) of antimony tarate (Sbivalent) and sodium stibogluconate (pentavalent) determined in promastigotes and intramacro amastigotes. The epidemiological cutoff (EFCO) differentiated Leish species causing cutaneous or visceral leishias susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S) to trivalent antimony.

The study's findings indicate a trend of increasing susceptibility in visceral leishias isolates, contrasting with rise in resistant phenotypes cutaneous isolates. The emergence of resistant phenotypes correlates with L. kiliwick (L. trop) isolates causing cutaneous leishias, which emerged in Algeria last decade. The study provides insight into spatiotemporal dynamics Leish antimony susceptibility, highlighting need for effective methodology to detect resistant strains.

The study's implications are significant for public health policy, as antimony remains treatment for leishias in Algeria. The emergence of resistant strains threatens treatment efficacy, necessitating monitoring and prevention. The study's results suggest increasing resistant cutaneous leishias isolates, particularly L. kiliwick, may be a concern. The study's methodology provides a framework for future research, detecting resistant strains and preventing dissemination.

The study's limitations include small sample size and limited geographic scope. The study only includes 106 isolates, and focuses on Algeria and France. Future studies should expand scope and sample size to better understand Leish dynamics. The study's findings are crucial for public health policy, as antimony remains treatment. The emergence resistant strains threaten treatment, necessitating monitoring and prevention.

test_case_11,"Malaria burden remains high in the sub-Saharan region where helminths are prevalent and where children are often infected with both types of parasites . Although the effect of helminths on malaria infection is evident , the impact of these co-infections is not clearly elucidated yet and the scarce findings are conflicting . In this study , we investigated the effect of schistosomiasis , considering soil-transmitted helminths ( STH ) , on prevalence and incidence of Plasmodium falciparum infection . This longitudinal survey was conducted in school-age children living in two rural communities in the vicinity of Lambaréné , Gabon . Thick blood smear light microscopy , urine filtration and the Kato-Katz technique were performed to detect malaria parasites , S . haematobium eggs and , STH eggs , respectively . P . falciparum carriage was assessed at inclusion , and incidence of malaria and time to the first malaria event were recorded in correlation with Schistosoma carriage status . Stratified multivariate analysis using generalized linear model was used to assess the risk of plasmodium infection considering interaction with STH , and survival analysis to assess time to malaria . The overall prevalence on subject enrolment was 30% , 23% and 9% for S . haematobium , P . falciparum infections and co-infection with both parasites , respectively . Our results showed that schistosomiasis in children tends to increase the risk of plasmodium infection but a combined effect with Trichuris trichiura or hookworm infection clearly increase the risk ( aOR = 3 . 9 [95%CI: 1 . 7–9 . 2] ) . The incidence of malaria over time was 0 . 51[95%CI: 0 . 45–0 . 57] per person-year and was higher in the Schistosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group ( 0 . 61 vs 0 . 43 , p = 0 . 02 ) , with a significant delay of time-to first-malaria event only in children aged from 6 to 10-years-old infected with Schistosoma haematobium . Our results suggest that STH enhance the risk for P . falciparum infection in schistosomiasis-positive children , and when infected , that schistosomiasis enhances susceptibility to developing malaria in young children but not in older children .","The study investigated the impact of co-infection with Schistosoma haematobium (a type of parasitic worm) and Plasmodium falciparum (malaria parasite) in school-age children living in rural areas of Gabon. The study found that children infected with Schosoma haob had a higher risk of developing malaria, especially when coinfected with Trichuris trura (hookworm) and had a higher risk of malaria incidence. The study also found that Schoma-infected children had a higher incidence of malaria over time compared to non-infected children, with a significant delay in time to first malaria event in children aged 6-10 years old.

The study highlights the complex relationship between helminth and malaria in sub-Saharan region where both parasites are prevalent. The study suggests that Schoma infection may increase susceptibility to malaria, especially in young children. The study's findings are consistent with previous research showing helmin can modulate immune response to malaria. The study's results indicate that co-infection with Schoma and Truris tr may be a risk factor for malaria.

The study's longitudinal design and use of multiple diagnostic methods (thick smear, light microscopy, urine filtration, and Kato-K technique) to detect parasites and eggs strengthen the findings. The use of stratified multivariate analysis and survival analysis to assess risk and time to malaria event is robust. The study's sample size of 30% of children is a good representation of rural Gabon's population.

The study's findings have implications for malaria control and prevention. The study suggests that targeting Schoma and Tris tr may reduce malaria incidence. The study's results also suggest that young children are more susceptible to malaria when infected with Schoma. The study's findings may inform policy and intervention strategies for malaria control in sub-Saharan region.

The study's limitations are that it only two rural communities and sample size. The study's generalizability to other regions is uncertain. The study's findings may not be due to other factors such as nutrition, environment, or socioeconomic status. The study's results may be influenced by other helminth infections. The study's findings may not be due to Schoma infection alone.

The study's results are consistent with previous research showing helmin modulate immune response to malaria. The study's findings suggest that Sch infection may increase susceptibility to malaria. The study's results indicate co-infection with Sch and Tris may be risk factor for malaria. The study's findings have implications for malaria control and prevention. The study's results suggest targeting Sch and Tr may reduce malaria incidence.","Despite the progress made in the last decade , malaria remains a serious public health issue in sub-Saharan region , where it overlaps with helminths infections .

We report here that Trichuris trichiura or hookworm associated with schistosomiasis increase the risk of Plasmodium falciparum infection; whilst schistosomiasis is independently associated with a malaria increase in young children , but not in the older children . Our finding is an additional evidence that optimizing helminth control mainly in children contributes to overcoming malaria in areas endemic for both parasitic infections where children are those who bear the highest burden of these infections .",False,0.41301322299646054,"The actual output provides a comprehensive summary of the study on co-infection with Schistosoma haematobium and Plasmodium falciparum in Gabonese children. It discusses the increased risk of malaria in Schistosoma-infected children, especially when co-infected with Trichuris trichiura. The findings, methods, implications, and limitations of the study are clearly outlined. However, the actual output lacks specific details present in both the input and expected output, reducing the final score."
