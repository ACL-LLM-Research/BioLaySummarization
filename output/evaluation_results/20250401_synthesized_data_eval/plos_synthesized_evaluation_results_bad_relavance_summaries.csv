test_case_0,"Gene expression varies widely between individuals of a population , and regulatory change can underlie phenotypes of evolutionary and biomedical relevance . A key question in the field is how DNA sequence variants impact gene expression , with most mechanistic studies to date focused on the effects of genetic change on regulatory regions upstream of protein-coding sequence . By contrast , the role of RNA 3′-end processing in regulatory variation remains largely unknown , owing in part to the challenge of identifying functional elements in 3′ untranslated regions . In this work , we conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblastoid cells from genetically distinct human individuals . Our analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3′ gene ends , finding that transcript end positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of 3′ regulatory elements , including miRNA sites . The usage of these transcript length forms and motifs varied across human individuals , and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and other 3′ motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay . Independent single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression of their respective genes , and validated the regulatory function of 3′ cis-regulatory sequence elements that mediated expression of these distinct RNA length forms . Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5 , we established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3′-end processing on regulatory response to antigen stimulation . Our results underscore the importance of two mechanisms at play in the genetics of 3′-end variation: the usage of distinct 3′-end processing signals and the effects of 3′ sequence elements that determine transcript fate . Our findings suggest that the strategy of integrating observed 3′-end positions with inferred 3′ regulatory motifs will prove to be a critical tool in continued efforts to interpret human genome variation .","The study explores the impact of genetic variations in the 3' end of genes on gene expression in human lymphoblast cells. The research focuses on the role of polyadenylation, a process that determines the length of the 3' end of a gene transcript, and its regulatory elements. The study reveals that the 3 end of genes do not occur randomly, but are often near regulatory elements such as microRNA sites. The length and motifs of transcripts vary between individuals and are influenced by polyaden signals and other motifs. The study shows that polyaden variants affect gene expression and that cis regulatory elements determine the fate of transcripts. The research highlights the importance of mechanisms in genetics of 3 end variation and suggests a strategy to integrate 3 end positions with regulatory motifs to understand human variation.","Messenger RNAs carry the instructions necessary to synthesize proteins that do work for the cell . Extending beyond the protein-coding sequence of a given mRNA is an additional stretch of sequence , harboring signals that govern how much protein is made and how long the mRNA remains in the cell before it is broken down . The incorporation of this end region into mature mRNA is itself subject to change; for the vast majority of human genes , how and why cells use different mRNA ends remains largely unknown . In this work , we surveyed mRNA ends from ∼10 , 000 genes in immune cells from genetically distinct human individuals . We found that mRNA end positions were not randomly distributed , but rather preferentially flanked the locations of regulatory signals that govern mRNA fate . The usage of these mRNA length forms and regulatory elements varied across individuals and could be dissected molecularly . Our results uncover key mechanisms and regulatory effects of transcript end processing , particularly as these are perturbed by genetic differences between humans .",False,0.27189402772744153,"Actual output lacks specificity in key details compared to expected output, such as the number of genes surveyed, the focus on regulatory signals that govern mRNA fate, and the molecular dissection of mRNA length forms and regulatory elements."
test_case_1,"The live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus ( LASIV ) vaccine SIVΔnef is one of the most effective vaccines in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge , yet little is known about the mechanisms underlying its remarkable protective efficacy . Here , we exploit deep sequencing technology and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping to deconstruct the CD8 T cell response , to identify the regions of immune pressure and viral escape , and to delineate the effect of epitope escape on the evolution of the CD8 T cell response in SIVΔnef-vaccinated animals . We demonstrate that the initial CD8 T cell response in the acute phase of SIVΔnef infection is mounted predominantly against more variable epitopes , followed by widespread sequence evolution and viral escape . Furthermore , we show that epitope escape expands the CD8 T cell repertoire that targets highly conserved epitopes , defined as anentropic specificity , and generates de novo responses to the escaped epitope variants during the vaccination period . These results correlate SIVΔnef-induced protection with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth . Importantly , these findings render SIVΔnef , long the gold standard in HIV/SIV vaccine research , as a proof-of-concept vaccine that highlights the significance of the twin principles of anentropic specificity and repertoire depth in successful vaccine design .","The study investigates the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of the SIVΔne vaccine, a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine that provides significant protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. The research focuses on the CD8 T cell response, a crucial component of the immune system that fights off viral infections, and its role in vaccine-induced protection. The study uses deep sequencing and comprehensive CD8 cell epitope mapping to understand the immune response, viral escape, and evolution in vaccinated animals. The results show that the initial CD8 response targets variable epitopes, followed by viral escape and expansion, and that escape leads to new responses to conserved epitopes and variants. The findings correlate vaccine protection with expanded conserved specificity and response depth, highlighting the importance of these principles in vaccine design.

The study contributes to the understanding of vaccine-induced immunity and the mechanisms of protection against lentiviral infections. The results demonstrate the significance of conserved specificity and depth in vaccine design, providing a framework for future vaccine development. The SIVne vaccine is a gold standard in HIV/SIV research, and the study provides a proof-of-concept for these principles.","Annually , more than two million people are infected with HIV , the virus that causes AIDS . Due to the ability of the virus to escape host immune responses , designing a successful HIV vaccine has been elusive . Similar to HIV in humans , rhesus macaques can be infected with SIV , a close relative and ancestor of HIV , resulting in simian AIDS . SIVΔnef , a live attenuated form of SIV , protects rhesus macaques from subsequent challenge with pathogenic SIV and is widely viewed as the most effective SIV vaccine . Here , we demonstrate that after vaccination of macaques with SIVΔnef , the immune response initially targets more variable regions of the virus , which the virus rapidly escapes . However , as the virus escapes , the immune response evolves to target more conserved regions of the virus as well as escape variants . This refocused targeting of conserved regions by the immune response provides a new mechanistic model that contributes to our understanding of how SIVΔnef vaccination protects animals from pathogenic challenge with SIV . Our findings also reinforce the importance of developing HIV vaccines that target conserved regions of the virus as well as their potential variants .",False,0.26800486380941446,"The actual output covers the main points of the input by discussing the mechanisms behind the SIVΔnef vaccine, CD8 T cell response, viral escape, and vaccine-induced protection. It also mentions the significance of conserved specificity and response depth in vaccine design. However, it lacks specific details from the input and does not fully match the expected output in terms of content."
